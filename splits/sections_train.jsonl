The anxiety exceeds what may be expected\ngiven the person’s developmental level (Criterion A). Individuals with separation anxiety\ndisorder have symptoms that meet at least three of the following criteria: They experience\nrecurrent excessive distress when separation from home or major attachment figures is an-\nticipated or occurs (Criterion A1). They worry about the well-being or death of attachment\nfigures, particularly when separated from them, and they need to know the whereabouts\nof their attachment figures and want to stay in touch with them (Criterion A2). They also\nworry about untoward events to themselves, such as getting lost, being kidnapped, or\nhaving an accident, that would keep them from ever being reunited with their major at-\ntachment figure (Criterion A3). Individuals with separation anxiety disorder are reluctant\nor refuse to go out by themselves because of separation fears (Criterion A4). They have\npersistent and excessive fear or reluctance about being alone or without major attachment\nfigures at home or in other settings. Children with separation anxiety disorder may be un-\nable to stay or go in a room by themselves and may display “clinging” behavior, staying\nclose to or “shadowing” the parent around the house, or requiring someone to be with\nthem when going to another room in the house (Criterion A5). They have persistent reluc-\ntance or refusal to go to sleep without being near a major attachment figure or to sleep\naway from home (Criterion A6). Children with this disorder often have difficulty at bed-\ntime and may insist that someone stay with them until they fall asleep. During the night,\nthey may make their way to their parents’ bed (or that of a significant other, such as a sib-\nling). Children may be reluctant or refuse to attend camp, to sleep at friends’ homes, or to\ngo on errands. Adults may be uncomfortable when traveling independently (e.g., sleeping\nin a hotel room). There may be repeated nightmares in which the content expresses the in-\n192\nAnxiety Disorders\ndividual’s separation anxiety (e.g., destruction of the family through fire, murder, or other\ncatastrophe) (Criterion A7). Physical symptoms (e.g., headaches, abdominal complaints,\nnausea, vomiting) are common in children when separation from major attachment fig-\nures occurs or is anticipated (Criterion A8). Cardiovascular symptoms such as palpitations,\ndizziness, and feeling faint are rare in younger children but may occur in adolescents and\nadults.\nThe disturbance must last for a period of at least 4 weeks in children and adolescents\nyounger than 18 years and is typically 6 months or longer in adults (Criterion B). However,\nthe duration criterion for adults should be used as a general guide, with allowance for\nsome degree of flexibility. The disturbance must cause clinically significant distress or im-\npairment in social, academic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Cri-\nterion C).", "associated_features": "When separated from major attachment figures, children with separation anxiety disorder\nmay exhibit social withdrawal, apathy, sadness, or difficulty concentrating on work or\nplay. Depending on their age, individuals may have fears of animals, monsters, the dark,\nmuggers, burglars, kidnappers, car accidents, plane travel, and other situations that are\nperceived as presenting danger to the family or themselves. Some individuals become\nhomesick and uncomfortable to the point of misery when away from home. Separation\nanxiety disorder in children may lead to school refusal, which in turn may lead to academic\ndifficulties and social isolation. When extremely upset at the prospect of separation, chil-\ndren may show anger or occasionally aggression toward someone who is forcing separa-\ntion. When alone, especially in the evening or the dark, young children may report unusual\nperceptual experiences (e.g., seeing people peering into their room, frightening creatures\nreaching for them, feeling eyes staring at them). Children with this disorder may be de-\nscribed as demanding, intrusive, and in need of constant attention, and, as adults, may ap-\npear dependent and overprotective. The individual’s excessive demands often become a\nsource of frustration for family members, leading to resentment and conflict in the family.", "prevalence": "The 12-month prevalence of separation anxiety disorder among adults in the United States\nis 0.9%–1.9%.

Onset of separation\nanxiety disorder may be as early as preschool age and may occur at any time during child-\nhood and more rarely in adolescence. Typically there are periods of exacerbation and re-\nmission. In some cases, both the anxiety about possible separation and the avoidance of\nsituations involving separation from the home or nuclear family (e.g., going away to col-\nlege, moving away from attachment figures) may persist through adulthood. However,\nthe majority of children with separation anxiety disorder are free of impairing anxiety dis-\norders over their lifetimes. Many adults with separation anxiety disorder do not recall a\nchildhood onset of separation anxiety disorder, although they may recall symptoms.\nSeparation Anxiety Disorder\n193\nThe manifestations of separation anxiety disorder vary with age. Younger children are\nmore reluctant to go to school or may avoid school altogether. Younger children may not\nexpress worries or specific fears of definite threats to parents, home, or themselves, and the\nanxiety is manifested only when separation is experienced. As children age, worries\nemerge; these are often worries about specific dangers (e.g., accidents, kidnapping, mug-\nging, death) or vague concerns about not being reunited with attachment figures. In adults,\nseparation anxiety disorder may limit their ability to cope with changes in circumstances\n(e.g., moving, getting married). Adults with the disorder are typically overconcerned about\ntheir offspring and spouses and experience marked discomfort when separated from them.\nThey may also experience significant disruption in work or social experiences because of\nneeding to continuously check on the whereabouts of a significant other.", "risk_factors": "Environmental.\nSeparation anxiety disorder often develops after life stress, especially a\nloss (e.g., the death of a relative or pet; an illness of the individual or a relative; a change of\nschools; parental divorce; a move to a new neighborhood; immigration; a disaster that in-\nvolved periods of separation from attachment figures). In young adults, other examples of\nlife stress include leaving the parental home, entering into a romantic relationship, and be-\ncoming a parent. Parental overprotection and intrusiveness may be associated with sepa-\nration anxiety disorder.\nGenetic and physiological.\nSeparation anxiety disorder in children may be heritable.\nHeritability was estimated at 73% in a community sample of 6-year-old twins, with higher\nrates in girls. Children with separation anxiety disorder display particularly enhanced\nsensitivity to respiratory stimulation using CO2-enriched air.", "cultural_issues": "There are cultural variations in the degree to which it is considered desirable to tolerate\nseparation, so that demands and opportunities for separation between parents and chil-\ndren are avoided in some cultures. For example, there is wide variation across countries\nand cultures with respect to the age at which it is expected that offspring should leave the\nparental home. It is important to differentiate separation anxiety disorder from the high\nvalue some cultures place on strong interdependence among family members.", "gender_issues": "Girls manifest greater reluctance to attend or avoidance of school than boys. Indirect ex-\npression of fear of separation may be more common in males than in females, for example,\nby limited independent activity, reluctance to be away from home alone, or distress when\nspouse or offspring do things independently or when contact with spouse or offspring is\nnot possible.", "diagnostic_markers": "", "suicide_risk": "Separation anxiety disorder in children may be associated with an increased risk for sui-\ncide. In a community sample, the presence of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, or sub-\nstance use has been associated with suicidal ideation and attempts. However, this\nassociation is not specific to separation anxiety disorder and is found in several anxiety\ndisorders.", "functional_consequences": "Individuals with separation anxiety disorder often limit independent activities away from\nhome or attachment figures (e.g., in children, avoiding school, not going to camp, having\n194\nAnxiety Disorders\ndifficulty sleeping alone; in adolescents, not going away to college; in adults, not leaving the\nparental home, not traveling, not working outside the home).", "differential_diagnosis": "Generalized anxiety disorder.\nSeparation anxiety disorder is distinguished from gener-\nalized anxiety disorder in that the anxiety predominantly concerns separation from attach-\nment figures, and if other worries occur, they do not predominate the clinical picture.\nPanic disorder.\nThreats of separation may lead to extreme anxiety and even a panic at-\ntack. In separation anxiety disorder, in contrast to panic disorder, the anxiety concerns the\npossibility of being away from attachment figures and worry about untoward events be-\nfalling them, rather than being incapacitated by an unexpected panic attack.\nAgoraphobia.\nUnlike individuals with agoraphobia, those with separation anxiety dis-\norder are not anxious about being trapped or incapacitated in situations from which es-\ncape is perceived as difficult in the event of panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating\nsymptoms.\nConduct disorder.\nSchool avoidance (truancy) is common in conduct disorder, but anx-\niety about separation is not responsible for school absences, and the child or adolescent\nusually stays away from, rather than returns to, the home.\nSocial anxiety disorder.\nSchool refusal may be due to social anxiety disorder (social pho-\nbia). In such instances, the school avoidance is due to fear of being judged negatively by oth-\ners rather than to worries about being separated from the attachment figures.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder.\nFear of separation from loved ones is common after trau-\nmatic events such as a disasters, particularly when periods of separation from loved ones\nwere experienced during the traumatic event. In posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the\ncentral symptoms concern intrusions about, and avoidance of, memories associated with\nthe traumatic event itself, whereas in separation anxiety disorder, the worries and avoid-\nance concern the well-being of attachment figures and separation from them.\nIllness anxiety disorder.\nIndividuals with illness anxiety disorder worry about specific\nillnesses they may have, but the main concern is about the medical diagnosis itself, not\nabout being separated from attachment figures.\nBereavement.\nIntense yearning or longing for the deceased, intense sorrow and emo-\ntional pain, and preoccupation with the deceased or the circumstances of the death are ex-\npected responses occurring in bereavement, whereas fear of separation from other\nattachment figures is central in separation anxiety disorder.\nDepressive and bipolar disorders.\nThese disorders may be associated with reluctance\nto leave home, but the main concern is not worry or fear of untoward events befalling at-\ntachment figures, but rather low motivation for engaging with the outside world. How-\never, individuals with separation anxiety disorder may become depressed while being\nseparated or in anticipation of separation.\nOppositional defiant disorder.\nChildren and adolescents with separation anxiety disor-\nder may be oppositional in the context of being forced to separate from attachment figures.\nOppositional defiant disorder should be considered only when there is persistent opposi-\ntional behavior unrelated to the anticipation or occurrence of separation from attachment\nfigures.\nPsychotic disorders.\nUnlike the hallucinations in psychotic disorders, the unusual per-\nceptual experiences that may occur in separation anxiety disorder are usually based on a\nmisperception of an actual stimulus, occur only in certain situations (e.g., nighttime), and\nare reversed by the presence of an attachment figure.\nSelective Mutism\n195\nPersonality disorders.\nDependent personality disorder is characterized by an indis-\ncriminate tendency to rely on others, whereas separation anxiety disorder involves con-\ncern about the proximity and safety of main attachment figures. Borderline personality\ndisorder is characterized by fear of abandonment by loved ones, but problems in identity,\nself-direction, interpersonal functioning, and impulsivity are additionally central to that\ndisorder, whereas they are not central to separation anxiety disorder.", "comorbidity": "In children, separation anxiety disorder is highly comorbid with generalized anxiety dis-\norder and specific phobia.

For example, if an individual fears thunderstorms and flying, then two diagnoses\nwould be given: specific phobia, natural environment, and specific phobia, situational.", "recording_procedures": "", "diagnostic_features": "A key feature of this disorder is that the fear or anxiety is circumscribed to the presence of a\nparticular situation or object (Criterion A), which may be termed the phobic stimulus. The cat-\negories of feared situations or objects are provided as specifiers. Many individuals fear objects\nor situations from more than one category, or phobic stimulus. For the diagnosis of specific\nphobia, the response must differ from normal, transient fears that commonly occur in the pop-\nulation. To meet the criteria for a diagnosis, the fear or anxiety must be intense or severe (i.e.,\n“marked”) (Criterion A). The amount of fear experienced may vary with proximity to the\nfeared object or situation and may occur in anticipation of or in the actual presence of the object\nor situation. Also, the fear or anxiety may take the form of a full or limited symptom panic at-\ntack (i.e., expected panic attack). Another characteristic of specific phobias is that fear or anxi-\nety is evoked nearly every time the individual comes into contact with the phobic stimulus\n(Criterion B). Thus, an individual who becomes anxious only occasionally upon being con-\nfronted with the situation or object (e.g., becomes anxious when flying only on one out of every\nfive airplane flights) would not be diagnosed with specific phobia. However, the degree of fear\nor anxiety expressed may vary (from anticipatory anxiety to a full panic attack) across different\noccasions of encountering the phobic object or situation because of various contextual factors\nsuch as the presence of others, duration of exposure, and other threatening elements such as\nturbulence on a flight for individuals who fear flying. Fear and anxiety are often expressed dif-\nferently between children and adults. Also, the fear or anxiety occurs as soon as the phobic ob-\nject or situation is encountered (i.e., immediately rather than being delayed).\nThe individual actively avoids the situation, or if he or she either is unable or decides\nnot to avoid it, the situation or object evokes intense fear or anxiety (Criterion C). Active\navoidance means the individual intentionally behaves in ways that are designed to prevent\nor minimize contact with phobic objects or situations (e.g., takes tunnels instead of bridges\non daily commute to work for fear of heights; avoids entering a dark room for fear of spi-\nders; avoids accepting a job in a locale where a phobic stimulus is more common). Avoid-\nSpecific Phobia\n199\nance behaviors are often obvious (e.g., an individual who fears blood refusing to go to the\ndoctor) but are sometimes less obvious (e.g., an individual who fears snakes refusing to\nlook at pictures that resemble the form or shape of snakes). Many individuals with specific\nphobias have suffered over many years and have changed their living circumstances in\nways designed to avoid the phobic object or situation as much as possible (e.g., an indi-\nvidual diagnosed with specific phobia, animal, who moves to reside in an area devoid of\nthe particular feared animal). Therefore, they no longer experience fear or anxiety in their\ndaily life. In such instances, avoidance behaviors or ongoing refusal to engage in activities\nthat would involve exposure to the phobic object or situation (e.g., repeated refusal to ac-\ncept offers for work-related travel because of fear of flying) may be helpful in confirming\nthe diagnosis in the absence of overt anxiety or panic.\nThe fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger that the object or situation\nposes, or more intense than is deemed necessary (Criterion D). Although individuals with\nspecific phobia often recognize their reactions as disproportionate, they tend to overesti-\nmate the danger in their feared situations, and thus the judgment of being out of propor-\ntion is made by the clinician. The individual’s sociocultural context should also be taken\ninto account. For example, fears of the dark may be reasonable in a context of ongoing\nviolence, and fear of insects may be more disproportionate in settings where insects are\nconsumed in the diet. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for\n6 months or more (Criterion E), which helps distinguish the disorder from transient fears\nthat are common in the population, particularly among children. However, the duration\ncriterion should be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility.\nThe specific phobia must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-\ncupational, or other important areas of functioning in order for the disorder to be diag-\nnosed (Criterion F).", "associated_features": "Individuals with specific phobia typically experience an increase in physiological arousal\nin anticipation of or during exposure to a phobic object or situation. However, the physi-\nological response to the feared situation or object varies. Whereas individuals with situa-\ntional, natural environment, and animal specific phobias are likely to show sympathetic\nnervous system arousal, individuals with blood-injection-injury specific phobia often\ndemonstrate a vasovagal fainting or near-fainting response that is marked by initial brief\nacceleration of heart rate and elevation of blood pressure followed by a deceleration of\nheart rate and a drop in blood pressure.

However, many individuals with specific phobia\nare unable to recall the specific reason for the onset of their phobias. Specific phobia usu-\nally develops in early childhood, with the majority of cases developing prior to age 10\nyears. The median age at onset is between 7 and 11 years, with the mean at about 10 years.\nSituational specific phobias tend to have a later age at onset than natural environment, an-\nimal, or blood-injection-injury specific phobias. Specific phobias that develop in child-\nhood and adolescence are likely to wax and wane during that period. However, phobias\nthat do persist into adulthood are unlikely to remit for the majority of individuals.\nWhen specific phobia is being diagnosed in children, two issues should be considered.\nFirst, young children may express their fear and anxiety by crying, tantrums, freezing,\nor clinging. Second, young children typically are not able to understand the concept of\navoidance. Therefore, the clinician should assemble additional information from parents,\nteachers, or others who know the child well. Excessive fears are quite common in young\nchildren but are usually transitory and only mildly impairing and thus considered devel-\nopmentally appropriate. In such cases a diagnosis of specific phobia would not be made.\nWhen the diagnosis of specific phobia is being considered in a child, it is important to\nassess the degree of impairment and the duration of the fear, anxiety, or avoidance, and\nwhether it is typical for the child’s particular developmental stage.\nAlthough the prevalence of specific phobia is lower in older populations, it remains\none of the more commonly experienced disorders in late life. Several issues should be con-\nsidered when diagnosing specific phobia in older populations. First, older individuals\nmay be more likely to endorse natural environment specific phobias, as well as phobias of\nfalling. Second, specific phobia (like all anxiety disorders) tends to co-occur with medical\nconcerns in older individuals, including coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease. Third, older individuals may be more likely to attribute the symptoms\nof anxiety to medical conditions. Fourth, older individuals may be more likely to manifest\nanxiety in an atypical manner (e.g., involving symptoms of both anxiety and depression)\nand thus be more likely to warrant a diagnosis of unspecified anxiety disorder. Addition-\nally, the presence of specific phobia in older adults is associated with decreased quality of\nlife and may serve as a risk factor for major neurocognitive disorder.\nAlthough most specific phobias develop in childhood and adolescence, it is possible for a\nspecific phobia to develop at any age, often as the result of experiences that are traumatic. For\nexample, phobias of choking almost always follow a near-choking event at any age.", "risk_factors": "Temperamental.\nTemperamental risk factors for specific phobia, such as negative affec-\ntivity (neuroticism) or behavioral inhibition, are risk factors for other anxiety disorders as\nwell.\nEnvironmental.\nEnvironmental risk factors for specific phobias, such as parental over-\nprotectiveness, parental loss and separation, and physical and sexual abuse, tend to pre-\ndict other anxiety disorders as well. As noted earlier, negative or traumatic encounters\nwith the feared object or situation sometimes (but not always) precede the development of\nspecific phobia.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThere may be a genetic susceptibility to a certain category of\nspecific phobia (e.g., an individual with a first-degree relative with a specific phobia of an-\nimals is significantly more likely to have the same specific phobia than any other category\nof phobia). Individuals with blood-injection-injury phobia show a unique propensity to\nvasovagal syncope (fainting) in the presence of the phobic stimulus.\nSpecific Phobia\n201", "cultural_issues": "In the United States, Asians and Latinos report significantly lower rates of specific phobia\nthan non-Latino whites, African Americans, and Native Americans. In addition to having\nlower prevalence rates of specific phobia, some countries outside of the United States, par-\nticularly Asian and African countries, show differing phobia content, age at onset, and\ngender ratios.", "gender_issues": "", "diagnostic_markers": "", "suicide_risk": "Individuals with specific phobia are up to 60% more likely to make a suicide attempt than\nare individuals without the diagnosis. However, it is likely that these elevated rates are\nprimarily due to comorbidity with personality disorders and other anxiety disorders.", "functional_consequences": "Individuals with specific phobia show similar patterns of impairment in psychosocial\nfunctioning and decreased quality of life as individuals with other anxiety disorders and\nalcohol and substance use disorders, including impairments in occupational and inter-\npersonal functioning. In older adults, impairment may be seen in caregiving duties and\nvolunteer activities. Also, fear of falling in older adults can lead to reduced mobility and\nreduced physical and social functioning, and may lead to receiving formal or informal\nhome support. The distress and impairment caused by specific phobias tend to increase\nwith the number of feared objects and situations. Thus, an individual who fears four ob-\njects or situations is likely to have more impairment in his or her occupational and social\nroles and a lower quality of life than an individual who fears only one object or situation.\nIndividuals with blood-injection-injury specific phobia are often reluctant to obtain med-\nical care even when a medical concern is present. Additionally, fear of vomiting and chok-\ning may substantially reduce dietary intake.", "differential_diagnosis": "Agoraphobia.\nSituational specific phobia may resemble agoraphobia in its clinical pre-\nsentation, given the overlap in feared situations (e.g., flying, enclosed places, elevators). If\nan individual fears only one of the agoraphobia situations, then specific phobia, situa-\ntional, may be diagnosed. If two or more agoraphobic situations are feared, a diagnosis of\nagoraphobia is likely warranted. For example, an individual who fears airplanes and ele-\nvators (which overlap with the “public transportation” agoraphobic situation) but does\nnot fear other agoraphobic situations would be diagnosed with specific phobia, situa-\ntional, whereas an individual who fears airplanes, elevators, and crowds (which overlap\nwith two agoraphobic situations, “using public transportation” and “standing in line and\nor being in a crowd”) would be diagnosed with agoraphobia. Criterion B of agoraphobia\n(the situations are feared or avoided “because of thoughts that escape might be difficult or\nhelp might not be available in the event of developing panic-like symptoms or other inca-\npacitating or embarrassing symptoms”) can also be useful in differentiating agoraphobia\nfrom specific phobia. If the situations are feared for other reasons, such as fear of being\nharmed directly by the object or situations (e.g., fear of the plane crashing, fear of the an-\nimal biting), a specific phobia diagnosis may be more appropriate.\nSocial anxiety disorder.\nIf the situations are feared because of negative evaluation, so-\ncial anxiety disorder should be diagnosed instead of specific phobia.\nSeparation anxiety disorder.\nIf the situations are feared because of separation from a\nprimary caregiver or attachment figure, separation anxiety disorder should be diagnosed\ninstead of specific phobia.\n202\nAnxiety Disorders\nPanic disorder.\nIndividuals with specific phobia may experience panic attacks when con-\nfronted with their feared situation or object. A diagnosis of specific phobia would be given if\nthe panic attacks only occurred in response to the specific object or situation, whereas a di-\nagnosis of panic disorder would be given if the individual also experienced panic attacks\nthat were unexpected (i.e., not in response to the specific phobia object or situation).\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nIf an individual’s primary fear or anxiety is of an ob-\nject or situation as a result of obsessions (e.g., fear of blood due to obsessive thoughts about\ncontamination from blood-borne pathogens [i.e., HIV]; fear of driving due to obsessive im-\nages of harming others), and if other diagnostic criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder\nare met, then obsessive-compulsive disorder should be diagnosed.\nTrauma- and stressor-related disorders.\nIf the phobia develops following a traumatic\nevent, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) should be considered as a diagnosis. How-\never, traumatic events can precede the onset of PTSD and specific phobia. In this case, a di-\nagnosis of specific phobia would be assigned only if all of the criteria for PTSD are not met.\nEating disorders.\nA diagnosis of specific phobia is not given if the avoidance behavior is\nexclusively limited to avoidance of food and food-related cues, in which case a diagnosis\nof anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa should be considered.\nSchizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.\nWhen the fear and avoidance\nare due to delusional thinking (as in schizophrenia or other schizophrenia spectrum and\nother psychotic disorders), a diagnosis of specific phobia is not warranted.", "comorbidity": "Specific phobia is rarely seen in medical-clinical settings in the absence of other psycho-\npathology and is more frequently seen in nonmedical mental health settings. Specific pho-\nbia is frequently associated with a range of other disorders, especially depression in older\nadults. Because of early onset, specific phobia is typically the temporally primary disorder.\nIndividuals with specific phobia are at increased risk for the development of other dis-\norders, including other anxiety disorders, depressive and bipolar disorders, substance-\nrelated disorders, somatic symptom and related disorders, and personality disorders (par-\nticularly dependent personality disorder)."}, "provenance": {"source_file": "anxiety_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 3, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.432382"}}

Performance fears\nmay also manifest in work, school, or academic settings in which regular public presenta-\ntions are required. Individuals with performance only social anxiety disorder do not fear\nor avoid nonperformance social situations.", "recording_procedures": "", "diagnostic_features": "The essential feature of social anxiety disorder is a marked, or intense, fear or anxiety of so-\ncial situations in which the individual may be scrutinized by others. In children the fear or\nanxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults (Criterion\nA). When exposed to such social situations, the individual fears that he or she will be neg-\natively evaluated. The individual is concerned that he or she will be judged as anxious,\nweak, crazy, stupid, boring, intimidating, dirty, or unlikable. The individual fears that\nhe or she will act or appear in a certain way or show anxiety symptoms, such as blushing,\ntrembling, sweating, stumbling over one’s words, or staring, that will be negatively eval-\nuated by others (Criterion B). Some individuals fear offending others or being rejected as\na result. Fear of offending others—for example, by a gaze or by showing anxiety symp-\ntoms—may be the predominant fear in individuals from cultures with strong collectivistic\norientations. An individual with fear of trembling of the hands may avoid drinking, eat-\ning, writing, or pointing in public; an individual with fear of sweating may avoid shaking\nhands or eating spicy foods; and an individual with fear of blushing may avoid public per-\nformance, bright lights, or discussion about intimate topics. Some individuals fear and\navoid urinating in public restrooms when other individuals are present (i.e., paruresis, or\n“shy bladder syndrome”).\nThe social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety (Criterion C). Thus, an in-\ndividual who becomes anxious only occasionally in the social situation(s) would not be di-\nagnosed with social anxiety disorder. However, the degree and type of fear and anxiety\nmay vary (e.g., anticipatory anxiety, a panic attack) across different occasions. The antici-\npatory anxiety may occur sometimes far in advance of upcoming situations (e.g., worrying\nevery day for weeks before attending a social event, repeating a speech for days in advance).\nIn children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, or\nshrinking in social situations. The individual will often avoid the feared social situations.\nAlternatively, the situations are endured with intense fear or anxiety (Criterion D). Avoid-\n204\nAnxiety Disorders\nance can be extensive (e.g., not going to parties, refusing school) or subtle (e.g., overpre-\nparing the text of a speech, diverting attention to others, limiting eye contact).\nThe fear or anxiety is judged to be out of proportion to the actual risk of being nega-\ntively evaluated or to the consequences of such negative evaluation (Criterion E). Some-\ntimes, the anxiety may not be judged to be excessive, because it is related to an actual\ndanger (e.g., being bullied or tormented by others). However, individuals with social anx-\niety disorder often overestimate the negative consequences of social situations, and thus\nthe judgment of being out of proportion is made by the clinician. The individual’s socio-\ncultural context needs to be taken into account when this judgment is being made. For ex-\nample, in certain cultures, behavior that might otherwise appear socially anxious may be\nconsidered appropriate in social situations (e.g., might be seen as a sign of respect).\nThe duration of the disturbance is typically at least 6 months (Criterion F). This dura-\ntion threshold helps distinguish the disorder from transient social fears that are com-\nmon, particularly among children and in the community. However, the duration criterion\nshould be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility. The fear,\nanxiety, and avoidance must interfere significantly with the individual’s normal routine,\noccupational or academic functioning, or social activities or relationships, or must cause\nclinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important ar-\neas of functioning (Criterion G). For example, an individual who is afraid to speak in pub-\nlic would not receive a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder if this activity is not routinely\nencountered on the job or in classroom work, and if the individual is not significantly dis-\ntressed about it. However, if the individual avoids, or is passed over for, the job or educa-\ntion he or she really wants because of social anxiety symptoms, Criterion G is met.", "associated_features": "Individuals with social anxiety disorder may be inadequately assertive or excessively sub-\nmissive or, less commonly, highly controlling of the conversation. They may show overly\nrigid body posture or inadequate eye contact, or speak with an overly soft voice. These in-\ndividuals may be shy or withdrawn, and they may be less open in conversations and dis-\nclose little about themselves. They may seek employment in jobs that do not require social\ncontact, although this is not the case for individuals with social anxiety disorder, perfor-\nmance only. They may live at home longer. Men may be delayed in marrying and having\na family, whereas women who would want to work outside the home may live a life as\nhomemaker and mother. Self-medication with substances is common (e.g., drinking be-\nfore going to a party). Social anxiety among older adults may also include exacerbation of\nsymptoms of medical illnesses, such as increased tremor or tachycardia. Blushing is a hall-\nmark physical response of social anxiety disorder.", "prevalence": "The 12-month prevalence estimate of social anxiety disorder for the United States is ap-\nproximately 7%.

The 12-month prevalence rates in children and adolescents are comparable\nto those in adults. Prevalence rates decrease with age. The 12-month prevalence for older\nadults ranges from 2% to 5%. In general, higher rates of social anxiety disorder are found\nin females than in males in the general population (with odds ratios ranging from 1.5 to\n2.2), and the gender difference in prevalence is more pronounced in adolescents and\nyoung adults. Gender rates are equivalent or slightly higher for males in clinical samples,\nand it is assumed that gender roles and social expectations play a significant role in ex-\nplaining the heightened help-seeking behavior in male patients. Prevalence in the United\nStates is higher in American Indians and lower in persons of Asian, Latino, African Amer-\nican, and Afro-Caribbean descent compared with non-Hispanic whites.\nSocial Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)\n205", "development_course": "Median age at onset of social anxiety disorder in the United States is 13 years, and 75% of\nindividuals have an age at onset between 8 and 15 years. The disorder sometimes emerges\nout of a childhood history of social inhibition or shyness in U.S. and European studies. On-\nset can also occur in early childhood. Onset of social anxiety disorder may follow a stress-\nful or humiliating experience (e.g., being bullied, vomiting during a public speech), or it\nmay be insidious, developing slowly. First onset in adulthood is relatively rare and is more\nlikely to occur after a stressful or humiliating event or after life changes that require new\nsocial roles (e.g., marrying someone from a different social class, receiving a job promo-\ntion). Social anxiety disorder may diminish after an individual with fear of dating marries\nand may reemerge after divorce. Among individuals presenting to clinical care, the disor-\nder tends to be particularly persistent.\nAdolescents endorse a broader pattern of fear and avoidance, including of dating,\ncompared with younger children. Older adults express social anxiety at lower levels but\nacross a broader range of situations, whereas younger adults express higher levels of so-\ncial anxiety for specific situations. In older adults, social anxiety may concern disability\ndue to declining sensory functioning (hearing, vision) or embarrassment about one’s ap-\npearance (e.g., tremor as a symptom of Parkinson’s disease) or functioning due to medical\nconditions, incontinence, or cognitive impairment (e.g., forgetting people’s names). In the\ncommunity approximately 30% of individuals with social anxiety disorder experience re-\nmission of symptoms within 1 year, and about 50% experience remission within a few\nyears. For approximately 60% of individuals without a specific treatment for social anxiety\ndisorder, the course takes several years or longer.\nDetection of social anxiety disorder in older adults may be challenging because of sev-\neral factors, including a focus on somatic symptoms, comorbid medical illness, limited\ninsight, changes to social environment or roles that may obscure impairment in social\nfunctioning, or reticence about describing psychological distress.", "risk_factors": "Temperamental.\nUnderlying traits that predispose individuals to social anxiety disor-\nder include behavioral inhibition and fear of negative evaluation.\nEnvironmental.\nThere is no causative role of increased rates of childhood maltreatment or\nother early-onset psychosocial adversity in the development of social anxiety disorder. How-\never, childhood maltreatment and adversity are risk factors for social anxiety disorder.\nGenetic and physiological.\nTraits predisposing individuals to social anxiety disorder,\nsuch as behavioral inhibition, are strongly genetically influenced.

Also, social anxiety disorder is heritable (but performance-only anxiety less so).\nFirst-degree relatives have a two to six times greater chance of having social anxiety dis-\norder, and liability to the disorder involves the interplay of disorder-specific (e.g., fear of\nnegative evaluation) and nonspecific (e.g., neuroticism) genetic factors.", "cultural_issues": "The syndrome of taijin kyofusho (e.g., in Japan and Korea) is often characterized by social-\nevaluative concerns, fulfilling criteria for social anxiety disorder, that are associated with\nthe fear that the individual makes other people uncomfortable (e.g., “My gaze upsets peo-\nple so they look away and avoid me”), a fear that is at times experienced with delusional\nintensity.

Prevalence rates of social anxiety disorder may\nnot be in line with self-reported social anxiety levels in the same culture—that is, societies\nwith strong collectivistic orientations may report high levels of social anxiety but low prev-\nalence of social anxiety disorder.", "gender_issues": "Females with social anxiety disorder report a greater number of social fears and comorbid\ndepressive, bipolar, and anxiety disorders, whereas males are more likely to fear dating,\nhave oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder, and use alcohol and illicit drugs to\nrelieve symptoms of the disorder. Paruresis is more common in males.", "diagnostic_markers": "", "suicide_risk": "", "functional_consequences": "Social anxiety disorder is associated with elevated rates of school dropout and with de-\ncreased well-being, employment, workplace productivity, socioeconomic status, and quality\nof life. Social anxiety disorder is also associated with being single, unmarried, or divorced\nand with not having children, particularly among men. In older adults, there may be impair-\nment in caregiving duties and volunteer activities. Social anxiety disorder also impedes lei-\nsure activities. Despite the extent of distress and social impairment associated with social\nanxiety disorder, only about half of individuals with the disorder in Western societies ever\nseek treatment, and they tend to do so only after 15–20 years of experiencing symptoms. Not\nbeing employed is a strong predictor for the persistence of social anxiety disorder.", "differential_diagnosis": "Normative shyness.\nShyness (i.e., social reticence) is a common personality trait and is\nnot by itself pathological. In some societies, shyness is even evaluated positively. How-\never, when there is a significant adverse impact on social, occupational, and other impor-\ntant areas of functioning, a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder should be considered, and\nwhen full diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder are met, the disorder should be di-\nagnosed. Only a minority (12%) of self-identified shy individuals in the United States have\nsymptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder.\nAgoraphobia.\nIndividuals with agoraphobia may fear and avoid social situations (e.g., go-\ning to a movie) because escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of\nincapacitation or panic-like symptoms, whereas individuals with social anxiety disorder are\nmost fearful of scrutiny by others. Moreover, individuals with social anxiety disorder are likely\nto be calm when left entirely alone, which is often not the case in agoraphobia.\nPanic disorder.\nIndividuals with social anxiety disorder may have panic attacks, but the\nconcern is about fear of negative evaluation, whereas in panic disorder the concern is\nabout the panic attacks themselves.\nGeneralized anxiety disorder.\nSocial worries are common in generalized anxiety disorder,\nbut the focus is more on the nature of ongoing relationships rather than on fear of negative\nevaluation. Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder, particularly children, may have ex-\ncessive worries about the quality of their social performance, but these worries also pertain to\nnonsocial performance and when the individual is not being evaluated by others. In social anx-\niety disorder, the worries focus on social performance and others’ evaluation.\nSeparation anxiety disorder.\nIndividuals with separation anxiety disorder may avoid\nsocial settings (including school refusal) because of concerns about being separated from\nattachment figures or, in children, about requiring the presence of a parent when it is not\ndevelopmentally appropriate. Individuals with separation anxiety disorder are usually\ncomfortable in social settings when their attachment figure is present or when they are at\nSocial Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)\n207\nhome, whereas those with social anxiety disorder may be uncomfortable when social sit-\nuations occur at home or in the presence of attachment figures.\nSpecific phobias.\nIndividuals with specific phobias may fear embarrassment or humil-\niation (e.g., embarrassment about fainting when they have their blood drawn), but they do\nnot generally fear negative evaluation in other social situations.\nSelective mutism.\nIndividuals with selective mutism may fail to speak because of fear of\nnegative evaluation, but they do not fear negative evaluation in social situations where no\nspeaking is required (e.g., nonverbal play).\nMajor depressive disorder.\nIndividuals with major depressive disorder may be con-\ncerned about being negatively evaluated by others because they feel they are bad or not\nworthy of being liked. In contrast, individuals with social anxiety disorder are worried\nabout being negatively evaluated because of certain social behaviors or physical symptoms.\nBody dysmorphic disorder.\nIndividuals with body dysmorphic disorder are preoccu-\npied with one or more perceived defects or flaws in their physical appearance that are not\nobservable or appear slight to others; this preoccupation often causes social anxiety and\navoidance. If their social fears and avoidance are caused only by their beliefs about their\nappearance, a separate diagnosis of social anxiety disorder is not warranted.\nDelusional disorder.\nIndividuals with delusional disorder may have nonbizarre delu-\nsions and/or hallucinations related to the delusional theme that focus on being rejected by\nor offending others. Although extent of insight into beliefs about social situations may\nvary, many individuals with social anxiety disorder have good insight that their beliefs are\nout of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation.\nAutism spectrum disorder.\nSocial anxiety and social communication deficits are hall-\nmarks of autism spectrum disorder. Individuals with social anxiety disorder typically\nhave adequate age-appropriate social relationships and social communication capacity,\nalthough they may appear to have impairment in these areas when first interacting with\nunfamiliar peers or adults.\nPersonality disorders.\nGiven its frequent onset in childhood and its persistence into and\nthrough adulthood, social anxiety disorder may resemble a personality disorder. The most\napparent overlap is with avoidant personality disorder. Individuals with avoidant person-\nality disorder have a broader avoidance pattern than those with social anxiety disorder.\nNonetheless, social anxiety disorder is typically more comorbid with avoidant personality\ndisorder than with other personality disorders, and avoidant personality disorder is more\ncomorbid with social anxiety disorder than with other anxiety disorders.\nOther mental disorders.\nSocial fears and discomfort can occur as part of schizophrenia,\nbut other evidence for psychotic symptoms is usually present. In individuals with an eat-\ning disorder, it is important to determine that fear of negative evaluation about eating\ndisorder symptoms or behaviors (e.g., purging and vomiting) is not the sole source of so-\ncial anxiety before applying a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder. Similarly, obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder may be associated with social anxiety, but the additional diagnosis of\nsocial anxiety disorder is used only when social fears and avoidance are independent of\nthe foci of the obsessions and compulsions.\nOther medical conditions.\nMedical conditions may produce symptoms that may be em-\nbarrassing (e.g. trembling in Parkinson’s disease). When the fear of negative evaluation\ndue to other medical conditions is excessive, a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder should\nbe considered.\nOppositional defiant disorder.\nRefusal to speak due to opposition to authority figures\nshould be differentiated from failure to speak due to fear of negative evaluation.\n208\nAnxiety Disorders", "comorbidity": "Social anxiety disorder is often comorbid with other anxiety disorders, major depressive\ndisorder, and substance use disorders, and the onset of social anxiety disorder generally\nprecedes that of the other disorders, except for specific phobia and separation anxiety dis-\norder. Chronic social isolation in the course of a social anxiety disorder may result in major\ndepressive disorder. Comorbidity with depression is high also in older adults. Substances\nmay be used as self-medication for social fears, but the symptoms of substance intoxica-\ntion or withdrawal, such as trembling, may also be a source of (further) social fear. Social\nanxiety disorder is frequently comorbid with bipolar disorder or body dysmorphic disor-\nder; for example, an individual has body dysmorphic disorder concerning a preoccupa-\ntion with a slight irregularity of her nose, as well as social anxiety disorder because of a\nsevere fear of sounding unintelligent. The more generalized form of social anxiety disor-\nder, but not social anxiety disorder, performance only, is often comorbid with avoidant\npersonality disorder.

If an indi-\nvidual’s presentation meets criteria for panic disorder and agoraphobia, both diagnoses\nshould be assigned.", "subtypes": "", "specifiers": "", "recording_procedures": "", "diagnostic_features": "The essential feature of agoraphobia is marked, or intense, fear or anxiety triggered by the\nreal or anticipated exposure to a wide range of situations (Criterion A). The diagnosis re-\nquires endorsement of symptoms occurring in at least two of the following five situations:\n1) using public transporation, such as automobiles, buses, trains, ships, or planes; 2) being\nin open spaces, such as parking lots, marketplaces, or bridges; 3) being in enclosed spaces,\nsuch as shops, theaters, or cinemas; 4) standing in line or being in a crowd; or 5) being out-\nside of the home alone. The examples for each situation are not exhaustive; other situations\nmay be feared. When experiencing fear and anxiety cued by such situations, individuals\ntypically experience thoughts that something terrible might happen (Criterion B). Individ-\nuals frequently believe that escape from such situations might be difficult (e.g., “can’t get\nout of here”) or that help might be unavailable (e.g., “there is nobody to help me”) when\npanic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms occur. “Panic-like\nsymptoms” refer to any of the 13 symptoms included in the criteria for panic attack, such as\ndizziness, faintness, and fear of dying. “Other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms”\ninclude symptoms such as vomiting and inflammatory bowel symptoms, as well as, in\nolder adults, a fear of falling or, in children, a sense of disorientation and getting lost.\nThe amount of fear experienced may vary with proximity to the feared situation and\nmay occur in anticipation of or in the actual presence of the agoraphobic situation. Also,\nthe fear or anxiety may take the form of a full- or limited-symptom panic attack (i.e., an ex-\npected panic attack). Fear or anxiety is evoked nearly every time the individual comes into\ncontact with the feared situation (Criterion C). Thus, an individual who becomes anxious\nonly occasionally in an agoraphobic situation (e.g., becomes anxious when standing in line\non only one out of every five occasions) would not be diagnosed with agoraphobia. The in-\ndividual actively avoids the situation or, if he or she either is unable or decides not to avoid\nit, the situation evokes intense fear or anxiety (Criterion D). Active avoidance means the in-\ndividual is currently behaving in ways that are intentionally designed to prevent or min-\nimize contact with agoraphobic situations. Avoidance can be behavioral (e.g., changing\nAgoraphobia\n219\ndaily routines, choosing a job nearby to avoid using public transportation, arranging for\nfood delivery to avoid entering shops and supermarkets) as well as cognitive (e.g., using\ndistraction to get through agoraphobic situations) in nature. The avoidance can become so\nsevere that the person is completely homebound. Often, an individual is better able to con-\nfront a feared situation when accompanied by a companion, such as a partner, friend, or\nhealth professional.\nThe fear, anxiety, or avoidance must be out of proportion to the actual danger posed by\nthe agoraphobic situations and to the sociocultural context (Criterion E). Differentiating\nclinically significant agoraphobic fears from reasonable fears (e.g., leaving the house dur-\ning a bad storm) or from situations that are deemed dangerous (e.g., walking in a parking\nlot or using public transportation in a high-crime area) is important for a number of reasons.\nFirst, what constitutes avoidance may be difficult to judge across cultures and sociocultural\ncontexts (e.g., it is socioculturally appropriate for orthodox Muslim women in certain parts\nof the world to avoid leaving the house alone, and thus such avoidance would not be con-\nsidered indicative of agoraphobia). Second, older adults are likely to overattribute their\nfears to age-related constraints and are less likely to judge their fears as being out of pro-\nportion to the actual risk. Third, individuals with agoraphobia are likely to overestimate\ndanger in relation to panic-like or other bodily symptoms. Agoraphobia should be diag-\nnosed only if the fear, anxiety, or avoidance persists (Criterion F) and if it causes clinically\nsignificant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of func-\ntioning (Criterion G). The duration of “typically lasting for 6 months or more” is meant to\nexclude individuals with short-lived, transient problems. However, the duration criterion\nshould be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility.", "associated_features": "In its most severe forms, agoraphobia can cause individuals to become completely home-\nbound, unable to leave their home and dependent on others for services or assistance to pro-\nvide even for basic needs. Demoralization and depressive symptoms, as well as abuse of\nalcohol and sedative medication as inappropriate self-medication strategies, are common.", "prevalence": "Every year approximately 1.7% of adolescents and adults have a diagnosis of agoraphobia.\nFemales are twice as likely as males to experience agoraphobia. Agoraphobia may occur in\nchildhood, but incidence peaks in late adolescence and early adulthood. Twelve-monthvary systematically across cultural/racial groups.", "development_course": "The percentage of individuals with agoraphobia reporting panic attacks or panic disorder\npreceding the onset of agoraphobia ranges from 30% in community samples to more than\n50% in clinic samples. The majority of individuals with panic disorder show signs of anx-\niety and agoraphobia before the onset of panic disorder.\nIn two-thirds of all cases of agoraphobia, initial onset is before age 35 years. There is a\nsubstantial incidence risk in late adolescence and early adulthood, with indications for\na second high incidence risk phase after age 40 years. First onset in childhood is rare. The\noverall mean age at onset for agoraphobia is 17 years, although the age at onset without\npreceding panic attacks or panic disorder is 25–29 years.\nThe course of agoraphobia is typically persistent and chronic. Complete remission is\nrare (10%), unless the agoraphobia is treated. With more severe agoraphobia, rates of full\nremission decrease, whereas rates of relapse and chronicity increase. A range of other dis-\norders, in particular other anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, substance use disor-\nders, and personality disorders, may complicate the course of agoraphobia. The long-term\n220\nAnxiety Disorders\ncourse and outcome of agoraphobia are associated with substantially elevated risk of sec-\nondary major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), and sub-\nstance use disorders.\nThe clinical features of agoraphobia are relatively consistent across the lifespan, although\nthe type of agoraphobic situations triggering fear, anxiety, or avoidance, as well as the type of\ncognitions, may vary. For example, in children, being outside of the home alone is the most fre-\nquent situation feared, whereas in older adults, being in shops, standing in line, and being in\nopen spaces are most often feared. Also, cognitions often pertain to becoming lost (in children),\nto experiencing panic-like symptoms (in adults), to falling (in older adults).\nThe low prevalence of agoraphobia in children could reflect difficulties in symptom re-\nporting, and thus assessments in young children may require solicitation of information\nfrom multiple sources, including parents or teachers. Adolescents, particularly males,\nmay be less willing than adults to openly discuss agoraphobic fears and avoidance; how-\never, agoraphobia can occur prior to adulthood and should be assessed in children and\nadolescents. In older adults, comorbid somatic symptom disorders, as well as motor dis-\nturbances (e.g., sense of falling or having medical complications), are frequently men-\ntioned by individuals as the reason for their fear and avoidance. In these instances, care is\nto be taken in evaluating whether the fear and avoidance are out of proportion to the real\ndanger involved.", "risk_factors": "Temperamental.\nBehavioral inhibition and neurotic disposition (i.e., negative affectivity\n[neuroticism] and anxiety sensitivity) are closely associated with agoraphobia but are rel-\nevant to most anxiety disorders (phobic disorders, panic disorder, generalized anxiety dis-\norder). Anxiety sensitivity (the disposition to believe that symptoms of anxiety are\nharmful) is also characteristic of individuals with agoraphobia.\nEnvironmental.\nNegative events in childhood (e.g., separation, death of parent) and other\nstressful events, such as being attacked or mugged, are associated with the onset of agorapho-\nbia. Furthermore, individuals with agoraphobia describe the family climate and child-rearing\nbehavior as being characterized by reduced warmth and increased overprotection.\nGenetic and physiological.\nHeritability for agoraphobia is 61%. Of the various phobias,\nagoraphobia has the strongest and most specific association with the genetic factor that\nrepresents proneness to phobias.", "cultural_issues": "", "gender_issues": "Females have different patterns of comorbid disorders than males. Consistent with gender\ndifferences in the prevalence of mental disorders, males have higher rates of comorbid\nsubstance use disorders.", "diagnostic_markers": "", "suicide_risk": "", "functional_consequences": "Agoraphobia is associated with considerable impairment and disability in terms of role\nfunctioning, work productivity, and disability days. Agoraphobia severity is a strong de-\nterminant of the degree of disability, irrespective of the presence of comorbid panic disor-\nder, panic attacks, and other comorbid conditions. More than one-third of individuals\nwith agoraphobia are completely homebound and unable to work.", "differential_diagnosis": "When diagnostic criteria for agoraphobia and another disorder are fully met, both diagnoses\nshould be assigned, unless the fear, anxiety, or avoidance of agoraphobia is attributable to the\nother disorder. Weighting of criteria and clinical judgment may be helpful in some cases.\nAgoraphobia\n221\nSpecific phobia, situational type.\nDifferentiating agoraphobia from situational specific\nphobia can be challenging in some cases, because these conditions share several symptom\ncharacteristics and criteria. Specific phobia, situational type, should be diagnosed versus ago-\nraphobia if the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is limited to one of the agoraphobic situations.\nRequiring fears from two or more of the agoraphobic situations is a robust means for differen-\ntiating agoraphobia from specific phobias, particularly the situational subtype. Additional dif-\nferentiating features include the cognitive ideation. Thus, if the situation is feared for reasons\nother than panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms (e.g., fears\nof being directly harmed by the situation itself, such as fear of the plane crashing for individ-\nuals who fear flying), then a diagnosis of specific phobia may be more appropriate.\nSeparation anxiety disorder.\nSeparation anxiety disorder can be best differentiated\nfrom agoraphobia by examining cognitive ideation. In separation anxiety disorder, the\nthoughts are about detachment from significant others and the home environment (i.e.,\nparents or other attachment figures), whereas in agoraphobia the focus is on panic-like\nsymptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms in the feared situations.\nSocial anxiety disorder (social phobia).\nAgoraphobia should be differentiated from so-\ncial anxiety disorder based primarily on the situational clusters that trigger fear, anxiety,\nor avoidance and the cognitive ideation. In social anxiety disorder, the focus is on fear of\nbeing negatively evaluated.\nPanic disorder.\nWhen criteria for panic disorder are met, agoraphobia should not be di-\nagnosed if the avoidance behaviors associated with the panic attacks do not extend to avoid-\nance of two or more agoraphobic situations.\nAcute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder.\nAcute stress disorder and\nposttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be differentiated from agoraphobia by examin-\ning whether the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is related only to situations that remind the\nindividual of a traumatic event. If the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is restricted to trauma re-\nminders, and if the avoidance behavior does not extend to two or more agoraphobic situ-\nations, then a diagnosis of agoraphobia is not warranted.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nIn major depressive disorder, the individual may avoid leav-\ning home because of apathy, loss of energy, low self-esteem, and anhedonia. If the avoid-\nance is unrelated to fears of panic-like or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms,\nthen agoraphobia should not be diagnosed.\nOther medical conditions.\nAgoraphobia is not diagnosed if the avoidance of situations\nis judged to be a physiological consequence of a medical condition. This determination is\nbased on history, laboratory findings, and a physical examination. Other relevant medical\nconditions may include neurodegenerative disorders with associated motor disturbances\n(e.g., Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis), as well as cardiovascular disorders. Individ-\nuals with certain medical conditions may avoid situations because of realistic concerns\nabout being incapacitated (e.g., fainting in an individual with transient ischemic attacks)\nor being embarrassed (e.g., diarrhea in an individual with Crohn’s disease). The diagnosis\nof agoraphobia should be given only when the fear or avoidance is clearly in excess of that\nusually associated with these medical conditions.", "comorbidity": "The majority of individuals with agoraphobia also have other mental disorders. The most\nfrequent additional diagnoses are other anxiety disorders (e.g., specific phobias, panic dis-\norder, social anxiety disorder), depressive disorders (major depressive disorder), PTSD,\nand alcohol use disorder. Whereas other anxiety disorders (e.g., separation anxiety disor-\nder, specific phobias, panic disorder) frequently precede onset of agoraphobia, depressive\ndisorders and substance use disorders typically occur secondary to agoraphobia.\n222\nAnxiety Disorders"}, "provenance": {"source_file": "anxiety_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 7, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.432382"}}

These episodes can\noccur in any combination and order. The episodes must meet both the duration and151\nsymptom number criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode and\nmust be demarcated by either a period of full remission or a switch to an episode\nof the opposite polarity. Manic and hypomanic episodes are counted as being on\nthe same pole. Except for the fact that they occur more frequently, the episodes that\noccur in a rapid-cycling pattern are no different from those that occur in a non-rapid-\ncycling pattern. Mood episodes that count toward defining a rapid-cycling pattern\nexclude those episodes directly caused by a substance (e.g., cocaine, corticoste-\nroids) or another medical condition.\nWith melancholic features:\nA. One of the following is present during the most severe period of the current episode:\n1. Loss of pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.\n2. Lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli (does not feel much better, even\ntemporarily, when something good happens).\nB. Three (or more) of the following:\n1. A distinct quality of depressed mood characterized by profound despondency,\ndespair, and/or moroseness or by so-called empty mood.\n2. Depression that is regularly worse in the morning.\n3. Early-morning awakening (i.e., at least 2 hours before usual awakening).\n4. Marked psychomotor agitation or retardation.\n5. Significant anorexia or weight loss.\n6. Excessive or inappropriate guilt.\nNote: The specifier “with melancholic features” is applied if these features are pres-\nent at the most severe stage of the episode. There is a near-complete absence of\nthe capacity for pleasure, not merely a diminution. A guideline for evaluating the\nlack of reactivity of mood is that even highly desired events are not associated with\nmarked brightening of mood. Either mood does not brighten at all, or it brightens\nonly partially (e.g., up to 20%–40% of normal for only minutes at a time). The “dis-\ntinct quality” of mood that is characteristic of the “with melancholic features” speci-\nfier is experienced as qualitatively different from that during a nonmelancholic\ndepressive episode. A depressed mood that is described as merely more severe,\nlonger lasting, or present without a reason is not considered distinct in quality. Psy-\nchomotor changes are nearly always present and are observable by others.\nMelancholic features exhibit only a modest tendency to repeat across episodes\nin the same individual. They are more frequent in inpatients, as opposed to outpa-\ntients; are less likely to occur in milder than in more severe major depressive epi-\nsodes; and are more likely to occur in those with psychotic features.\nWith atypical features: This specifier can be applied when these features predomi-\nnate during the majority of days of the current or most recent major depressive epi-\nsode.\nA. Mood reactivity (i.e., mood brightens in response to actual or potential positive\nevents).\nB. Two (or more) of the following features:\n1. Significant weight gain or increase in appetite.\n2. Hypersomnia.\n3. Leaden paralysis (i.e., heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs).\n4. A long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity (not limited to epi-\nsodes of mood disturbance) that results in significant social or occupational\nimpairment.\n152\nBipolar and Related Disorders\nC. Criteria are not met for “with melancholic features” or “with catatonia” during the\nsame episode.\nNote: “Atypical depression” has historical significance (i.e., atypical in contradis-\ntinction to the more classical agitated, “endogenous” presentations of depression\nthat were the norm when depression was rarely diagnosed in outpatients and al-\nmost never in adolescents or younger adults) and today does not connote an un-\ncommon or unusual clinical presentation as the term might imply.\nMood reactivity is the capacity to be cheered up when presented with positive\nevents (e.g., a visit from children, compliments from others). Mood may become\neuthymic (not sad) even for extended periods of time if the external circumstances\nremain favorable. Increased appetite may be manifested by an obvious increase in\nfood intake or by weight gain. Hypersomnia may include either an extended period\nof nighttime sleep or daytime napping that totals at least 10 hours of sleep per day\n(or at least 2 hours more than when not depressed). Leaden paralysis is defined as\nfeeling heavy, leaden, or weighted down, usually in the arms or legs. This sensation\nis generally present for at least an hour a day but often lasts for many hours at a\ntime. Unlike the other atypical features, pathological sensitivity to perceived inter-\npersonal rejection is a trait that has an early onset and persists throughout most of\nadult life. Rejection sensitivity occurs both when the person is and is not depressed,\nthough it may be exacerbated during depressive periods.\nWith psychotic features: Delusions or hallucinations are present at any time in the\nepisode. If psychotic features are present, specify if mood-congruent or mood-incon-\ngruent:\nWith mood-congruent psychotic features: During manic episodes, the con-\ntent of all delusions and hallucinations is consistent with the typical manic\nthemes of grandiosity, invulnerability, etc., but may also include themes of sus-\npiciousness or paranoia, especially with respect to others’ doubts about the in-\ndividual’s capacities, accomplishments, and so forth.\nWith mood-incongruent psychotic features: The content of delusions and\nhallucinations is inconsistent with the episode polarity themes as described\nabove, or the content is a mixture of mood-incongruent and mood-congruent\nthemes.\nWith catatonia: This specifier can apply to an episode of mania or depression if cata-\ntonic features are present during most of the episode. See criteria for catatonia asso-\nciated with a mental disorder in the chapter “Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other\nPsychotic Disorders.”\nWith peripartum onset: This specifier can be applied to the current or, if the full crite-\nria are not currently met for a mood episode, most recent episode of mania, hypoma-\nnia, or major depression in bipolar I or bipolar II disorder if onset of mood symptoms\noccurs during pregnancy or in the 4 weeks following delivery.\nNote: Mood episodes can have their onset either during pregnancy or postpartum.\nAlthough the estimates differ according to the period of follow-up after delivery, be-\ntween 3% and 6% of women will experience the onset of a major depressive epi-\nsode during pregnancy or in the weeks or months following delivery. Fifty percent\nof “postpartum” major depressive episodes actually begin prior to delivery. Thus,\nthese episodes are referred to collectively as peripartum episodes. Women with\nperipartum major depressive episodes often have severe anxiety and even panic\nattacks. Prospective studies have demonstrated that mood and anxiety symptoms\nduring pregnancy, as well as the “baby blues,” increase the risk for a postpartum\nmajor depressive episode.153\nPeripartum-onset mood episodes can present either with or without psychotic\nfeatures. Infanticide is most often associated with postpartum psychotic episodes\nthat are characterized by command hallucinations to kill the infant or delusions that\nthe infant is possessed, but psychotic symptoms can also occur in severe postpar-\ntum mood episodes without such specific delusions or hallucinations.\nPostpartum mood (major depressive or manic) episodes with psychotic features\nappear to occur in from 1 in 500 to 1 in 1,000 deliveries and may be more common\nin primiparous women. The risk of postpartum episodes with psychotic features is\nparticularly increased for women with prior postpartum mood episodes but is also\nelevated for those with a prior history of a depressive or bipolar disorder (especially\nbipolar I disorder) and those with a family history of bipolar disorders.\nOnce a woman has had a postpartum episode with psychotic features, the risk\nof recurrence with each subsequent delivery is between 30% and 50%. Postpartum\nepisodes must be differentiated from delirium occurring in the postpartum period,\nwhich is distinguished by a fluctuating level of awareness or attention. The postpar-\ntum period is unique with respect to the degree of neuroendocrine alterations and\npsychosocial adjustments, the potential impact of breast-feeding on treatment plan-\nning, and the long-term implications of a history of postpartum mood disorder on sub-\nsequent family planning.\nWith seasonal pattern: This specifier applies to the lifetime pattern of mood episodes.\nThe essential feature is a regular seasonal pattern of at least one type of episode (i.e.,\nmania, hypomania, or depression). The other types of episodes may not follow this pat-\ntern. For example, an individual may have seasonal manias, but his or her depressions\ndo not regularly occur at a specific time of year.\nA. There has been a regular temporal relationship between the onset of manic, hypo-\nmanic, or major depressive episodes and a particular time of the year (e.g., in the\nfall or winter) in bipolar I or bipolar II disorder.\nNote: Do not include cases in which there is an obvious effect of seasonally related\npsychosocial stressors (e.g., regularly being unemployed every winter).\nB. Full remissions (or a change from major depression to mania or hypomania or vice\nversa) also occur at a characteristic time of the year (e.g., depression disappears\nin the spring).\nC. In the last 2 years, the individual’s manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episodes\nhave demonstrated a temporal seasonal relationship, as defined above, and no\nnon-seasonal episodes of that polarity have occurred during that 2-year period.\nD. Seasonal manias, hypomanias, or depressions (as described above) substantially\noutnumber any nonseasonal manias, hypomanias, or depressions that may have\noccurred over the individual’s lifetime.\nNote: This specifier can be applied to the pattern of major depressive episodes in\nbipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, or major depressive disorder, recurrent. The\nessential feature is the onset and remission of major depressive episodes at char-\nacteristic times of the year. In most cases, the episodes begin in fall or winter and\nremit in spring. Less commonly, there may be recurrent summer depressive epi-\nsodes. This pattern of onset and remission of episodes must have occurred during\nat least a 2-year period, without any nonseasonal episodes occurring during this\nperiod. In addition, the seasonal depressive episodes must substantially outnum-\nber any nonseasonal depressive episodes over the individual’s lifetime.\nThis specifier does not apply to those situations in which the pattern is better ex-\nplained by seasonally linked psychosocial stressors (e.g., seasonal unemployment\nor school schedule). Major depressive episodes that occur in a seasonal pattern\n154\nBipolar and Related Disorders\nare often characterized by prominent energy, hypersomnia, overeating, weight\ngain, and a craving for carbohydrates. It is unclear whether a seasonal pattern is\nmore likely in recurrent major depressive disorder or in bipolar disorders. However,\nwithin the bipolar disorders group, a seasonal pattern appears to be more likely in\nbipolar II disorder than in bipolar I disorder. In some individuals, the onset of manic\nor hypomanic episodes may also be linked to a particular season.\nThe prevalence of winter-type seasonal pattern appears to vary with latitude,\nage, and sex.

This severe irritability has two prominent clinical manifestations, the first of\nwhich is frequent temper outbursts. These outbursts typically occur in response to frus-\ntration and can be verbal or behavioral (the latter in the form of aggression against prop-\nerty, self, or others). They must occur frequently (i.e., on average, three or more times per\nweek) (Criterion C) over at least 1 year in at least two settings (Criteria E and F), such as in\nthe home and at school, and they must be developmentally inappropriate (Criterion B).\nThe second manifestation of severe irritability consists of chronic, persistently irritable or\nangry mood that is present between the severe temper outbursts. This irritable or angry\nmood must be characteristic of the child, being present most of the day, nearly every day,\nand noticeable by others in the child’s environment (Criterion D).\nDisruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder\n157\nThe clinical presentation of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder must be carefully\ndistinguished from presentations of other, related conditions, particularly pediatric bi-\npolar disorder. In fact, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder was added to DSM-5 to\naddress the considerable concern about the appropriate classification and treatment of\nchildren who present with chronic, persistent irritability relative to children who present\nwith classic (i.e., episodic) bipolar disorder.\nSome researchers view severe, non-episodic irritability as characteristic of bipolar dis-\norder in children, although both DSM-IV and DSM-5 require that both children and adults\nhave distinct episodes of mania or hypomania to qualify for the diagnosis of bipolar I dis-\norder. During the latter decades of the 20th century, this contention by researchers that\nsevere, nonepisodic irritability is a manifestation of pediatric mania coincided with an up-\nsurge in the rates at which clinicians assigned the diagnosis of bipolar disorder to their\npediatric patients. This sharp increase in rates appears to be attributable to clinicians com-\nbining at least two clinical presentations into a single category. That is, both classic, epi-\nsodic presentations of mania and non-episodic presentations of severe irritability have\nbeen labeled as bipolar disorder in children. In DSM-5, the term bipolar disorder is explicitly\nreserved for episodic presentations of bipolar symptoms. DSM-IV did not include a diagno-\nsis designed to capture youths whose hallmark symptoms consisted of very severe, non-\nepisodic irritability, whereas DSM-5, with the inclusion of disruptive mood dysregulation\ndisorder, provides a distinct category for such presentations.", "associated_features": "", "prevalence": "Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is common among children presenting to pedi-\natric mental health clinics. Prevalence estimates of the disorder in the community are un-\nclear. Based on rates of chronic and severe persistent irritability, which is the core feature\nof the disorder, the overall 6-month to 1-year period-prevalence of disruptive mood dys-\nregulation disorder among children and adolescents probably falls in the 2%–5% range.\nHowever, rates are expected to be higher in males and school-age children than in females\nand adolescents.", "development_course": "The onset of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder must be before age 10 years, and the\ndiagnosis should not be applied to children with a developmental age of less than 6 years.\nIt is unknown whether the condition presents only in this age-delimited fashion. Because\nthe symptoms of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are likely to change as children\nmature, use of the diagnosis should be restricted to age groups similar to those in which\nvalidity has been established (7–18 years). Approximately half of children with severe,\nchronic irritability will have a presentation that continues to meet criteria for the condition\n1 year later. Rates of conversion from severe, nonepisodic irritability to bipolar disorder\nare very low. Instead, children with chronic irritability are at risk to develop unipolar de-\npressive and/or anxiety disorders in adulthood.\nAge-related variations also differentiate classic bipolar disorder and disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder. Rates of bipolar disorder generally are very low prior to adoles-\ncence (<1%), with a steady increase into early adulthood (1%–2% prevalence). Disruptive\nmood dysregulation disorder is more common than bipolar disorder prior to adolescence,\nand symptoms of the condition generally become less common as children transition into\nadulthood.", "risk_factors": "Temperamental.\nChildren with chronic irritability typically exhibit complicated psy-\nchiatric histories. In such children, a relatively extensive history of chronic irritability is\n158\nDepressive Disorders\ncommon, typically manifesting before full criteria for the syndrome are met. Such predi-\nagnostic presentations may have qualified for a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder.\nMany children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder have symptoms that also\nmeet criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and for an anxiety dis-\norder, with such diagnoses often being present from a relatively early age. For some chil-\ndren, the criteria for major depressive disorder may also be met.\nGenetic and physiological.\nIn terms of familial aggregation and genetics, it has been\nsuggested that children presenting with chronic, non-episodic irritability can be differen-\ntiated from children with bipolar disorder in their family-based risk. However, these two\ngroups do not differ in familial rates of anxiety disorders, unipolar depressive disorders,\nor substance abuse. Compared with children with pediatric bipolar disorder or other men-\ntal illnesses, those with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder exhibit both commonal-\nities and differences in information-processing deficits. For example, face-emotion\nlabeling deficits, as well as perturbed decision making and cognitive control, are present in\nchildren with bipolar disorder and chronically irritable children, as well as in children\nwith some other psychiatric conditions. There is also evidence for disorder-specific dys-\nfunction, such as during tasks assessing attention deployment in response to emotional\nstimuli, which has demonstrated unique signs of dysfunction in children with chronic ir-\nritability.", "cultural_issues": "", "gender_issues": "Children presenting to clinics with features of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are\npredominantly male.

Because of their extremely low frustration tolerance, such children\ngenerally have difficulty succeeding in school; they are often unable to participate in the\nactivities typically enjoyed by healthy children; their family life is severely disrupted by\ntheir outbursts and irritability; and they have trouble initiating or sustaining friendships.\nLevels of dysfunction in children with bipolar disorder and disruptive mood dysregulation\ndisorder are generally comparable. Both conditions cause severe disruption in the lives of\nthe affected individual and their families. In both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder\nand pediatric bipolar disorder, dangerous behavior, suicidal ideation or suicide attempts,\nsevere aggression, and psychiatric hospitalization are common.", "differential_diagnosis": "Because chronically irritable children and adolescents typically present with complex histo-\nries, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder must be made while consid-\nering the presence or absence of multiple other conditions. Despite the need to consider\nDisruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder\n159\nmany other syndromes, differentiation of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from bi-\npolar disorder and oppositional defiant disorder requires particularly careful assessment.\nBipolar disorders.\nThe central feature differentiating disruptive mood dysregulation disor-\nder and bipolar disorders in children involves the longitudinal course of the core symptoms. In\nchildren, as in adults, bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder manifest as an episodic illness\nwith discrete episodes of mood perturbation that can be differentiated from the child’s typical\npresentation. The mood perturbation that occurs during a manic episode is distinctly different\nfrom the child’s usual mood. In addition, during a manic episode, the change in mood must be\naccompanied by the onset, or worsening, of associated cognitive, behavioral, and physical\nsymptoms (e.g., distractibility, increased goal-directed activity), which are also present to a de-\ngree that is distinctly different from the child’s usual baseline. Thus, in the case of a manic ep-\nisode, parents (and, depending on developmental level, children) should be able to identify a\ndistinct time period during which the child’s mood and behavior were markedly different\nfrom usual. In contrast, the irritability of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is persistent\nand is present over many months; while it may wax and wane to a certain degree, severe irri-\ntability is characteristic of the child with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Thus, while\nbipolar disorders are episodic conditions, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is not. In\nfact, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder cannot be assigned to a child\nwho has ever experienced a full-duration hypomanic or manic episode (irritable or euphoric)\nor who has ever had a manic or hypomanic episode lasting more than 1 day. Another central\ndifferentiating feature between bipolar disorders and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder\nis the presence of elevated or expansive mood and grandiosity. These symptoms are common\nfeatures of mania but are not characteristic of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.\nOppositional defiant disorder.\nWhile symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder typi-\ncally do occur in children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, mood symptoms\nof disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are relatively rare in children with opposi-\ntional defiant disorder. The key features that warrant the diagnosis of disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder in children whose symptoms also meet criteria for oppositional de-\nfiant disorder are the presence of severe and frequently recurrent outbursts and a persis-\ntent disruption in mood between outbursts. In addition, the diagnosis of disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder requires severe impairment in at least one setting (i.e., home,\nschool, or among peers) and mild to moderate impairment in a second setting. For this rea-\nson, while most children whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregula-\ntion disorder will also have a presentation that meets criteria for oppositional defiant\ndisorder, the reverse is not the case. That is, in only approximately 15% of individuals with\noppositional defiant disorder would criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder\nbe met. Moreover, even for children in whom criteria for both disorders are met, only the\ndiagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made. Finally, both the\nprominent mood symptoms in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and the high risk\nfor depressive and anxiety disorders in follow-up studies justify placement of disruptive\nmood dysregulation disorder among the depressive disorders in DSM-5. (Oppositional\ndefiant disorder is included in the chapter “Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct\nDisorders.”) This reflects the more prominent mood component among individuals with\ndisruptive mood dysregulation disorder, as compared with individuals with oppositional\ndefiant disorder. Nevertheless, it also should be noted that disruptive mood dysregulation\ndisorder appears to carry a high risk for behavioral problems as well as mood problems.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders,\nand autism spectrum disorder.\nUnlike children diagnosed with bipolar disorder or op-\npositional defiant disorder, a child whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder also can receive a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD, major depressive\ndisorder, and/or anxiety disorder. However, children whose irritability is present only in\nthe context of a major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)\n160\nDepressive Disorders\nshould receive one of those diagnoses rather than disruptive mood dysregulation disor-\nder. Children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder may have symptoms that also\nmeet criteria for an anxiety disorder and can receive both diagnoses, but children whose ir-\nritability is manifest only in the context of exacerbation of an anxiety disorder should re-\nceive the relevant anxiety disorder diagnosis rather than disruptive mood dysregulation\ndisorder. In addition, children with autism spectrum disorders frequently present with\ntemper outbursts when, for example, their routines are disturbed. In that instance, the\ntemper outbursts would be considered secondary to the autism spectrum disorder, and\nthe child should not receive the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.\nIntermittent explosive disorder.\nChildren with symptoms suggestive of intermittent\nexplosive disorder present with instances of severe temper outbursts, much like children\nwith disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. However, unlike disruptive mood dysreg-\nulation disorder, intermittent explosive disorder does not require persistent disruption in\nmood between outbursts. In addition, intermittent explosive disorder requires only 3 months\nof active symptoms, in contrast to the 12-month requirement for disruptive mood dys-\nregulation disorder. Thus, these two diagnoses should not be made in the same child. For\nchildren with outbursts and intercurrent, persistent irritability, only the diagnosis of dis-\nruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made.", "comorbidity": "Rates of comorbidity in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are extremely high. It is\nrare to find individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation\ndisorder alone. Comorbidity between disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and other\nDSM-defined syndromes appears higher than for many other pediatric mental illnesses;\nthe strongest overlap is with oppositional defiant disorder. Not only is the overall rate ofbid illnesses appears particularly diverse. These children typically present to the clinic\nwith a wide range of disruptive behavior, mood, anxiety, and even autism spectrum\nsymptoms and diagnoses. However, children with disruptive mood dysregulation disor-\nder should not have symptoms that meet criteria for bipolar disorder, as in that context,\nonly the bipolar disorder diagnosis should be made. If children have symptoms that meet\ncriteria for oppositional defiant disorder or intermittent explosive disorder and disruptive\nmood dysregulation disorder, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disor-\nder should be assigned. Also, as noted earlier, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregu-\nlation disorder should not be assigned if the symptoms occur only in an anxiety-\nprovoking context, when the routines of a child with autism spectrum disorder or obses-\nsive-compulsive disorder are disturbed, or in the context of a major depressive episode."}, "provenance": {"source_file": "depressive_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 1, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.442385"}}

Al-\nthough there are no infallible guidelines for determining whether the relationship\nbetween the mood disturbance and the general medical condition is etiological, several\nconsiderations provide some guidance in this area. One consideration is the presence of a\ntemporal association between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of the general medical\ncondition and that of the mood disturbance. A second consideration is the presence of fea-\ntures that are atypical of primary Mood Disorders (e.g., atypical age at onset or course or\nabsence of family history).

In the largest\nseries, the duration of the major depressive episode following stroke was 9–11 months on\naverage.

Feeling keyed up or tense.\n2. Feeling unusually restless.\n3. Difficulty concentrating because of worry.\n4. Fear that something awful may happen.\n5. Feeling that the individual might lose control of himself or herself.\nSpecify current severity:\nMild: Two symptoms.\nModerate: Three symptoms.\nModerate-severe: Four or five symptoms.\nSevere: Four or five symptoms and with motor agitation.\nNote: Anxious distress has been noted as a prominent feature of both bipolar and ma-\njor depressive disorder in both primary care and specialty mental health settings. High\nlevels of anxiety have been associated with higher suicide risk, longer duration of ill-\nness, and greater likelihood of treatment nonresponse. As a result, it is clinically useful\nto specify accurately the presence and severity levels of anxious distress for treatment\nplanning and monitoring of response to treatment.\nWith mixed features:\nA. At least three of the following manic/hypomanic symptoms are present nearly every\nday during the majority of days of a major depressive episode:\n1. Elevated, expansive mood.\n2. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.\n3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.\n4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.\n5. Increase in energy or goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or\nsexually).185\n6. Increased or excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for\npainful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual in-\ndiscretions, foolish business investments).\n7. Decreased need for sleep (feeling rested despite sleeping less than usual; to be\ncontrasted with insomnia).\nB. Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from the per-\nson’s usual behavior.\nC. For individuals whose symptoms meet full criteria for either mania or hypomania,\nthe diagnosis should be bipolar I or bipolar II disorder.\nD. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance\n(e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication or other treatment).\nNote: Mixed features associated with a major depressive episode have been found\nto be a significant risk factor for the development of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder.\nAs a result, it is clinically useful to note the presence of this specifier for treatment\nplanning and monitoring of response to treatment.\nWith melancholic features:\nA. One of the following is present during the most severe period of the current epi-\nsode:\n1. Loss of pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.\n2. Lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli (does not feel much better, even\ntemporarily, when something good happens).\nB. Three (or more) of the following:\n1. A distinct quality of depressed mood characterized by profound despondency,\ndespair, and/or moroseness or by so-called empty mood.\n2. Depression that is regularly worse in the morning.\n3. Early-morning awakening (i.e., at least 2 hours before usual awakening).\n4. Marked psychomotor agitation or retardation.\n5. Significant anorexia or weight loss.\n6. Excessive or inappropriate guilt.\nNote: The specifier “with melancholic features” is applied if these features are present\nat the most severe stage of the episode. There is a near-complete absence of the ca-\npacity for pleasure, not merely a diminution. A guideline for evaluating the lack of reac-\ntivity of mood is that even highly desired events are not associated with marked\nbrightening of mood. Either mood does not brighten at all, or it brightens only partially\n(e.g., up to 20%–40% of normal for only minutes at a time). The “distinct quality” of mood\nthat is characteristic of the “with melancholic features” specifier is experienced as qual-\nitatively different from that during a nonmelancholic depressive episode. A depressed\nmood that is described as merely more severe, longer lasting, or present without a rea-\nson is not considered distinct in quality. Psychomotor changes are nearly always pres-\nent and are observable by others.\nMelancholic features exhibit only a modest tendency to repeat across episodes in the\nsame individual. They are more frequent in inpatients, as opposed to outpatients; are\nless likely to occur in milder than in more severe major depressive episodes; and are\nmore likely to occur in those with psychotic features.\nWith atypical features: This specifier can be applied when these features predomi-\nnate during the majority of days of the current or most recent major depressive episode\nor persistent depressive disorder.\nA. Mood reactivity (i.e., mood brightens in response to actual or potential positive\nevents).\n186\nDepressive Disorders\nB. Two (or more) of the following:\n1. Significant weight gain or increase in appetite.\n2. Hypersomnia.\n3. Leaden paralysis (i.e., heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs).\n4. A long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity (not limited to epi-\nsodes of mood disturbance) that results in significant social or occupational im-\npairment.\nC. Criteria are not met for “with melancholic features” or “with catatonia” during the\nsame episode.\nNote: “Atypical depression” has historical significance (i.e., atypical in contradistinction\nto the more classical agitated, “endogenous” presentations of depression that were the\nnorm when depression was rarely diagnosed in outpatients and almost never in ado-\nlescents or younger adults) and today does not connote an uncommon or unusual clin-\nical presentation as the term might imply.\nMood reactivity is the capacity to be cheered up when presented with positive events\n(e.g., a visit from children, compliments from others). Mood may become euthymic (not\nsad) even for extended periods of time if the external circumstances remain favorable.\nIncreased appetite may be manifested by an obvious increase in food intake or by\nweight gain. Hypersomnia may include either an extended period of nighttime sleep or\ndaytime napping that totals at least 10 hours of sleep per day (or at least 2 hours more\nthan when not depressed). Leaden paralysis is defined as feeling heavy, leaden, or\nweighted down, usually in the arms or legs. This sensation is generally present for at\nleast an hour a day but often lasts for many hours at a time. Unlike the other atypical\nfeatures, pathological sensitivity to perceived interpersonal rejection is a trait that has\nan early onset and persists throughout most of adult life. Rejection sensitivity occurs\nboth when the person is and is not depressed, though it may be exacerbated during\ndepressive periods.\nWith psychotic features: Delusions and/or hallucinations are present.\nWith mood-congruent psychotic features: The content of all delusions and hal-\nlucinations is consistent with the typical depressive themes of personal inade-\nquacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment.\nWith mood-incongruent psychotic features: The content of the delusions or hal-\nlucinations does not involve typical depressive themes of personal inadequacy,\nguilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment, or the content is a mixture\nof mood-incongruent and mood-congruent themes.\nWith catatonia: The catatonia specifier can apply to an episode of depression if cata-\ntonic features are present during most of the episode. See criteria for catatonia asso-\nciated with a mental disorder (for a description of catatonia, see the chapter\n“Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders”).\nWith peripartum onset: This specifier can be applied to the current or, if full criteria\nare not currently met for a major depressive episode, most recent episode of major de-\npression if onset of mood symptoms occurs during pregnancy or in the 4 weeks follow-\ning delivery.\nNote: Mood episodes can have their onset either during pregnancy or postpartum.\nAlthough the estimates differ according to the period of follow-up after delivery, be-\ntween 3% and 6% of women will experience the onset of a major depressive epi-\nsode during pregnancy or in the weeks or months following delivery. Fifty percent\nof “postpartum” major depressive episodes actually begin prior to delivery. Thus,\nthese episodes are referred to collectively as peripartum episodes. Women with\nperipartum major depressive episodes often have severe anxiety and even panic187\nattacks. Prospective studies have demonstrated that mood and anxiety symptoms\nduring pregnancy, as well as the “baby blues,” increase the risk for a postpartum\nmajor depressive episode.\nPeripartum-onset mood episodes can present either with or without psychotic\nfeatures. Infanticide is most often associated with postpartum psychotic episodes\nthat are characterized by command hallucinations to kill the infant or delusions that\nthe infant is possessed, but psychotic symptoms can also occur in severe postpar-\ntum mood episodes without such specific delusions or hallucinations.\nPostpartum mood (major depressive or manic) episodes with psychotic features\nappear to occur in from 1 in 500 to 1 in 1,000 deliveries and may be more common\nin primiparous women. The risk of postpartum episodes with psychotic features is\nparticularly increased for women with prior postpartum mood episodes but is also\nelevated for those with a prior history of a depressive or bipolar disorder (especially\nbipolar I disorder) and those with a family history of bipolar disorders.\nOnce a woman has had a postpartum episode with psychotic features, the risk\nof recurrence with each subsequent delivery is between 30% and 50%. Postpartum\nepisodes must be differentiated from delirium occurring in the postpartum period,\nwhich is distinguished by a fluctuating level of awareness or attention. The postpar-\ntum period is unique with respect to the degree of neuroendocrine alterations and\npsychosocial adjustments, the potential impact of breast-feeding on treatment\nplanning, and the long-term implications of a history of postpartum mood disorder\non subsequent family planning.\nWith seasonal pattern: This specifier applies to recurrent major depressive disorder.\nA. There has been a regular temporal relationship between the onset of major depres-\nsive episodes in major depressive disorder and a particular time of the year (e.g.,\nin the fall or winter).\nNote: Do not include cases in which there is an obvious effect of seasonally related\npsychosocial stressors (e.g., regularly being unemployed every winter).\nB. Full remissions (or a change from major depression to mania or hypomania) also\noccur at a characteristic time of the year (e.g., depression disappears in the spring).\nC. In the last 2 years, two major depressive episodes have occurred that demonstrate\nthe temporal seasonal relationships defined above and no nonseasonal major de-\npressive episodes have occurred during that same period.\nD. Seasonal major depressive episodes (as described above) substantially outnum-\nber the nonseasonal major depressive episodes that may have occurred over the\nindividual’s lifetime.\nNote: The specifier “with seasonal pattern” can be applied to the pattern of major de-\npressive episodes in major depressive disorder, recurrent. The essential feature is the\nonset and remission of major depressive episodes at characteristic times of the year.\nIn most cases, the episodes begin in fall or winter and remit in spring. Less commonly,\nthere may be recurrent summer depressive episodes. This pattern of onset and remis-\nsion of episodes must have occurred during at least a 2-year period, without any non-\nseasonal episodes occurring during this period. In addition, the seasonal depressive\nepisodes must substantially outnumber any nonseasonal depressive episodes over\nthe individual’s lifetime.\nThis specifier does not apply to those situations in which the pattern is better ex-\nplained by seasonally linked psychosocial stressors (e.g., seasonal unemployment or\nschool schedule). Major depressive episodes that occur in a seasonal pattern are often\ncharacterized by prominent energy, hypersomnia, overeating, weight gain, and a crav-\ning for carbohydrates. It is unclear whether a seasonal pattern is more likely in recur-\nrent major depressive disorder or in bipolar disorders. However, within the bipolar\ndisorders group, a seasonal pattern appears to be more likely in bipolar II disorder than\n188\nDepressive Disorders\nin bipolar I disorder. In some individuals, the onset of manic or hypomanic episodes\nmay also be linked to a particular season.\nThe prevalence of winter-type seasonal pattern appears to vary with latitude, age,\nand sex. Prevalence increases with higher latitudes. Age is also a strong predictor of\nseasonality, with younger persons at higher risk for winter depressive episodes.\nSpecify if:\nIn partial remission: Symptoms of the immediately previous major depressive episode\nare present, but full criteria are not met, or there is a period lasting less than 2 months\nwithout any significant symptoms of a major depressive episode following the end of\nsuch an episode.\nIn full remission: During the past 2 months, no significant signs or symptoms of the\ndisturbance were present.\nSpecify current severity:\nSeverity is based on the number of criterion symptoms, the severity of those symptoms,\nand the degree of functional disability.\nMild: Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are\npresent, the intensity of the symptoms is distressing but manageable, and the symp-\ntoms result in minor impairment in social or occupational functioning.\nModerate: The number of symptoms, intensity of symptoms, and/or functional impair-\nment are between those specified for “mild” and “severe.”\nSevere: The number of symptoms is substantially in excess of that required to make\nthe diagnosis, the intensity of the symptoms is seriously distressing and unmanage-\nable, and the symptoms markedly interfere with social and occupational functioning.\n189", "recording_procedures": "", "diagnostic_features": "", "associated_features": "", "prevalence": "", "development_course": "", "risk_factors": "", "cultural_issues": "", "gender_issues": "", "diagnostic_markers": "", "suicide_risk": "", "functional_consequences": "", "differential_diagnosis": "", "comorbidity": ""}, "provenance": {"source_file": "depressive_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 8, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.443383"}}

It is not unusual for individuals with oppositional defiant disorder to show the behav-\nioral features of the disorder without problems of negative mood. However, individuals\nwith the disorder who show the angry/irritable mood symptoms typically show the be-\nhavioral features as well.\nThe symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder may be confined to only one setting,\nand this is most frequently the home. Individuals who show enough symptoms to meet\nthe diagnostic threshold, even if it is only at home, may be significantly impaired in their\nsocial functioning. However, in more severe cases, the symptoms of the disorder are pres-\nent in multiple settings. Given that the pervasiveness of symptoms is an indicator of the\nseverity of the disorder, it is critical that the individual’s behavior be assessed across mul-\ntiple settings and relationships. Because these behaviors are common among siblings, they\nmust be observed during interactions with persons other than siblings. Also, because\nsymptoms of the disorder are typically more evident in interactions with adults or peers\nwhom the individual knows well, they may not be apparent during a clinical examination.\nThe symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder can occur to some degree in individu-\nals without this disorder. There are several key considerations for determining if the be-\nhaviors are symptomatic of oppositional defiant disorder. First, the diagnostic threshold\nof four or more symptoms within the preceding 6 months must be met. Second, the per-\nsistence and frequency of the symptoms should exceed what is normative for an individ-\nual’s age, gender, and culture. For example, it is not unusual for preschool children to\nshow temper tantrums on a weekly basis. Temper outbursts for a preschool child would be\nconsidered a symptom of oppositional defiant disorder only if they occurred on most days\nfor the preceding 6 months, if they occurred with at least three other symptoms of the dis-\norder, and if the temper outbursts contributed to the significant impairment associated\nwith the disorder (e.g., led to destruction of property during outbursts, resulted in the\nchild being asked to leave a preschool).\nThe symptoms of the disorder often are part of a pattern of problematic interactions\nwith others. Furthermore, individuals with this disorder typically do not regard themselves\nas angry, oppositional, or defiant. Instead, they often justify their behavior as a response to\nunreasonable demands or circumstances. Thus, it can be difficult to disentangle the rela-\ntive contribution of the individual with the disorder to the problematic interactions he or\nshe experiences. For example, children with oppositional defiant disorder may have ex-\nperienced a history of hostile parenting, and it is often impossible to determine if the\nchild’s behavior caused the parents to act in a more hostile manner toward the child, if the\nparents’ hostility led to the child’s problematic behavior, or if there was some combination\nof both. Whether or not the clinician can separate the relative contributions of potential\ncausal factors should not influence whether or not the diagnosis is made. In the event that\nthe child may be living in particularly poor conditions where neglect or mistreatment may\noccur (e.g., in institutional settings), clinical attention to reducing the contribution of the\nenvironment may be helpful.\n464\nDisruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders", "associated_features": "In children and adolescents, oppositional defiant disorder is more prevalent in families in\nwhich child care is disrupted by a succession of different caregivers or in families in which\nharsh, inconsistent, or neglectful child-rearing practices are common. Two of the most\ncommon co-occurring conditions with oppositional defiant disorder are attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder (see the section “Comorbidity” for\nthis disorder). Oppositional defiant disorder has been associated with increased risk for\nsuicide attempts, even after comorbid disorders are controlled for.", "prevalence": "The prevalence of oppositional defiant disorder ranges from 1% to 11%, with an averagedepending on the age and gender of the child. The disorder appears to be somewhat more\nprevalent in males than in females (1.4:1) prior to adolescence. This male predominance is\nnot consistently found in samples of adolescents or adults.", "development_course": "The first symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder usually appear during the preschool\nyears and rarely later than early adolescence. Oppositional defiant disorder often precedes\nthe development of conduct disorder, especially for those with the childhood-onset type\nof conduct disorder. However, many children and adolescents with oppositional defiant\ndisorder do not subsequently develop conduct disorder. Oppositional defiant disorder\nalso conveys risk for the development of anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder,\neven in the absence of conduct disorder. The defiant, argumentative, and vindictive symp-\ntoms carry most of the risk for conduct disorder, whereas the angry-irritable mood symp-\ntoms carry most of the risk for emotional disorders.\nManifestations of the disorder across development appear consistent. Children and\nadolescents with oppositional defiant disorder are at increased risk for a number of prob-\nlems in adjustment as adults, including antisocial behavior, impulse-control problems,\nsubstance abuse, anxiety, and depression.\nMany of the behaviors associated with oppositional defiant disorder increase in fre-\nquency during the preschool period and in adolescence.

However, the severity, frequency, and chronicity of temper outbursts are more\nsevere in individuals with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder than in those with\noppositional defiant disorder. Thus, only a minority of children and adolescents whose\nsymptoms meet criteria for oppositional defiant disorder would also be diagnosed with dis-\nruptive mood dysregulation disorder.

Individuals\nwith oppositional defiant disorder are also at increased risk for anxiety disorders and ma-\njor depressive disorder, and this seems largely attributable to the presence of the angry-\nirritable mood symptoms.

Both subtypes can occur in a mild,\nmoderate, or severe form. An unspecified-onset subtype is designated when there is in-\nsufficient information to determine age at onset.\nIn childhood-onset conduct disorder, individuals are usually male, frequently display\nphysical aggression toward others, have disturbed peer relationships, may have had op-\npositional defiant disorder during early childhood, and usually have symptoms that meet\nfull criteria for conduct disorder prior to puberty. Many children with this subtype also\nhave concurrent attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or other neurodevel-\nopmental difficulties. Individuals with childhood-onset type are more likely to have per-\nsistent conduct disorder into adulthood than are those with adolescent-onset type. As\ncompared with individuals with childhood-onset type, individuals with adolescent-onset\nconduct disorder are less likely to display aggressive behaviors and tend to have more\nnormative peer relationships (although they often display conduct problems in the com-\npany of others). These individuals are less likely to have conduct disorder that persists into\nadulthood. The ratio of males to females with conduct disorder is more balanced for the\nadolescent-onset type than for the childhood-onset type.", "specifiers": "A minority of individuals with conduct disorder exhibit characteristics that qualify for the\n“with limited prosocial emotions” specifier.

These behaviors fall into four main groupings: aggressive conduct\nthat causes or threatens physical harm to other people or animals (Criteria A1–A7); non-\naggressive conduct that causes property loss or damage (Criteria A8–A9); deceitfulness or\ntheft (Criteria A10–A12); and serious violations of rules (Criteria A13–A15). Three or more\ncharacteristic behaviors must have been present during the past 12 months, with at least\none behavior present in the past 6 months. The disturbance in behavior causes clinically\nsignificant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning (Criterion B). The\nbehavior pattern is usually present in a variety of settings, such as home, at school, or in\nthe community. Because individuals with conduct disorder are likely to minimize their\nconduct problems, the clinician often must rely on additional informants. However, infor-\nmants’ knowledge of the individual’s conduct problems may be limited if they have inad-\nequately supervised the individual or the individual has concealed symptom behaviors.\nIndividuals with conduct disorder often initiate aggressive behavior and react aggres-\nsively to others. They may display bullying, threatening, or intimidating behavior (includ-\ning bullying via messaging on Web-based social media) (Criterion A1); initiate frequent\nphysical fights (Criterion A2); use a weapon that can cause serious physical harm (e.g., a bat,\nbrick, broken bottle, knife, gun) (Criterion A3); be physically cruel to people (Criterion A4)\nor animals (Criterion A5); steal while confronting a victim (e.g., mugging, purse snatching,\nextortion, armed robbery) (Criterion A6); or force someone into sexual activity (Criterion A7).\nPhysical violence may take the form of rape, assault, or, in rare cases, homicide. Deliberate\ndestruction of others’ property may include deliberate fire setting with the intention of caus-\ning serious damage (Criterion A8) or deliberate destroying of other people’s property in\nother ways (e.g., smashing car windows, vandalizing school property) (Criterion A9). Acts of\ndeceitfulness or theft may include breaking into someone else’s house, building, or car (Crite-\nrion A10); frequently lying or breaking promises to obtain goods or favors or to avoid debts\nor obligations (e.g., “conning” other individuals) (Criterion A11); or stealing items of non-\ntrivial value without confronting the victim (e.g., shoplifting, forgery, fraud) (Criterion A12).\nIndividuals with conduct disorder may also frequently commit serious violations of\nrules (e.g., school, parental, workplace). Children with conduct disorder often have a pat-\ntern, beginning before age 13 years, of staying out late at night despite parental prohi-\nbitions (Criterion A13). Children may also show a pattern of running away from home\novernight (Criterion A14). To be considered a symptom of conduct disorder, the running\naway must have occurred at least twice (or only once if the individual did not return for a\nlengthy period). Runaway episodes that occur as a direct consequence of physical or sex-\nual abuse do not typically qualify for this criterion. Children with conduct disorder may\noften be truant from school, beginning prior to age 13 years (Criterion A15).", "associated_features": "Especially in ambiguous situations, aggressive individuals with conduct disorder fre-\nquently misperceive the intentions of others as more hostile and threatening than is the\nConduct Disorder\n473\ncase and respond with aggression that they then feel is reasonable and justified. Person-\nality features of trait negative emotionality and poor self-control, including poor frustra-\ntion tolerance, irritability, temper outbursts, suspiciousness, insensitivity to punishment,\nthrill seeking, and recklessness, frequently co-occur with conduct disorder. Substance\nmisuse is often an associated feature, particularly in adolescent females.

Oppositional defiant disorder is a common precursor to the child-\nhood-onset type of conduct disorder. Conduct disorder may be diagnosed in adults, how-\never, symptoms of conduct disorder usually emerge in childhood or adolescence, and\nonset is rare after age 16 years. The course of conduct disorder after onset is variable. In a\nmajority of individuals, the disorder remits by adulthood. Many individuals with conduct\ndisorder—particularly those with adolescent-onset type and those with few and milder\nsymptoms—achieve adequate social and occupational adjustment as adults. However, the\nearly-onset type predicts a worse prognosis and an increased risk of criminal behavior,\nconduct disorder, and substance-related disorders in adulthood. Individuals with conduct\ndisorder are at risk for later mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress dis-\norder, impulse-control disorders, psychotic disorders, somatic symptom disorders, and\nsubstance-related disorders as adults.\nSymptoms of the disorder vary with age as the individual develops increased physical\nstrength, cognitive abilities, and sexual maturity. Symptom behaviors that emerge first\ntend to be less serious (e.g., lying, shoplifting), whereas conduct problems that emerge last\ntend to be more severe (e.g., rape, theft while confronting a victim). However, there are\nwide differences among individuals, with some engaging in the more damaging behaviors\nat an early age (which is predictive of a worse prognosis). When individuals with conduct\ndisorder reach adulthood, symptoms of aggression, property destruction, deceitfulness,\nand rule violation, including violence against co-workers, partners, and children, may be ex-\nhibited in the workplace and the home, such that antisocial personality disorder may be\nconsidered.", "risk_factors": "Temperamental.\nTemperamental risk factors include a difficult undercontrolled infant\ntemperament and lower-than-average intelligence, particularly with regard to verbal IQ.\nEnvironmental.\nFamily-level risk factors include parental rejection and neglect, inconsis-\ntent child-rearing practices, harsh discipline, physical or sexual abuse, lack of supervision,\nearly institutional living, frequent changes of caregivers, large family size, parental criminal-\nity, and certain kinds of familial psychopathology (e.g., substance-related disorders). Com-\nmunity-level risk factors include peer rejection, association with a delinquent peer group,\nand neighborhood exposure to violence. Both types of risk factors tend to be more common\nand severe among individuals with the childhood-onset subtype of conduct disorder.\n474\nDisruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders\nGenetic and physiological.\nConduct disorder is influenced by both genetic and envi-\nronmental factors. The risk is increased in children with a biological or adoptive parent or\na sibling with conduct disorder. The disorder also appears to be more common in children\nof biological parents with severe alcohol use disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, or\nschizophrenia or biological parents who have a history of ADHD or conduct disorder.\nFamily history particularly characterizes individuals with the childhood-onset subtype of\nconduct disorder. Slower resting heart rate has been reliably noted in individuals with\nconduct disorder compared with those without the disorder, and this marker is not char-\nacteristic of any other mental disorder. Reduced autonomic fear conditioning, particularly\nlow skin conductance, is also well documented. However, these psychophysiological find-\nings are not diagnostic of the disorder. Structural and functional differences in brain areas\nassociated with affect regulation and affect processing, particularly frontotemporal-limbic\nconnections involving the brain’s ventral prefrontal cortex and amygdala, have been con-\nsistently noted in individuals with conduct disorder compared with those without the dis-\norder.

Females with a diagnosis of conduct disorder are more likely\nto exhibit lying, truancy, running away, substance use, and prostitution.

When criteria are met for both ADHD and conduct disorder, both\ndiagnoses should be given.\nDepressive and bipolar disorders.\nIrritability, aggression, and conduct problems can\noccur in children or adolescents with a major depressive disorder, a bipolar disorder, or\ndisruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The behaviorial problems associated with these\nmood disorders can usually be distinguished from the pattern of conduct problems seen in\nconduct disorder based on their course. Specifically, persons with conduct disorder will\ndisplay substantial levels of aggressive or non-aggressive conduct problems during peri-\nods in which there is no mood disturbance, either historically (i.e., a history of conduct\nproblems predating the onset of the mood disturbance) or concurrently (i.e., display of\nsome conduct problems that are premeditated and do not occur during periods of intense\nemotional arousal). In those cases in which criteria for conduct disorder and a mood dis-\norder are met, both diagnoses can be given.\nIntermittent explosive disorder.\nBoth conduct disorder and intermittent explosive dis-\norder involve high rates of aggression. However, the aggression in individuals with inter-\nmittent explosive disorder is limited to impulsive aggression and is not premeditated, and\nit is not committed in order to achieve some tangible objective (e.g., money, power, intim-\nidation). Also, the definition of intermittent explosive disorder does not include the non-\naggressive symptoms of conduct disorder. If criteria for both disorders are met, the diag-\nnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should be given only when the recurrent impul-\nsive aggressive outbursts warrant independent clinical attention.\nAdjustment disorders.\nThe diagnosis of an adjustment disorder (with disturbance of con-\nduct or with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct) should be considered if clinically\nsignificant conduct problems that do not meet the criteria for another specific disorder de-\nvelop in clear association with the onset of a psychosocial stressor and do not resolve within\n6 months of the termination of the stressor (or its consequences).

The overtness or\ncovertness of these personality states, however, varies as a function of psychological\nmotivation, current level of stress, culture, internal conflicts and dynamics, and emotional\nresilience. Sustained periods of identity disruption may occur when psychosocial pres-\nsures are severe and/or prolonged. In many possession-form cases of dissociative identity\ndisorder, and in a small proportion of non-possession-form cases, manifestations of alter-\nnate identities are highly overt. Most individuals with non-possession-form dissociative\nidentity disorder do not overtly display their discontinuity of identity for long periods of\ntime; only a small minority present to clinical attention with observable alternation of\nDissociative Identity Disorder\n293\nidentities. When alternate personality states are not directly observed, the disorder can be\nidentified by two clusters of symptoms: 1) sudden alterations or discontinuities in sense of\nself and sense of agency (Criterion A), and 2) recurrent dissociative amnesias (Criterion B).\nCriterion A symptoms are related to discontinuities of experience that can affect any\naspect of an individual’s functioning. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder may\nreport the feeling that they have suddenly become depersonalized observers of their\n“own” speech and actions, which they may feel powerless to stop (sense of self). Such in-\ndividuals may also report perceptions of voices (e.g., a child’s voice; crying; the voice of a\nspiritual being). In some cases, voices are experienced as multiple, perplexing, indepen-\ndent thought streams over which the individual experiences no control. Strong emotions,\nimpulses, and even speech or other actions may suddenly emerge, without a sense of per-\nsonal ownership or control (sense of agency). These emotions and impulses are frequently\nreported as ego-dystonic and puzzling. Attitudes, outlooks, and personal preferences\n(e.g., about food, activities, dress) may suddenly shift and then shift back. Individuals may\nreport that their bodies feel different (e.g., like a small child, like the opposite gender, huge\nand muscular). Alterations in sense of self and loss of personal agency may be accompa-\nnied by a feeling that these attitudes, emotions, and behaviors—even one’s body—are\n“not mine” and/or are “not under my control.” Although most Criterion A symptoms are\nsubjective, many of these sudden discontinuities in speech, affect, and behavior can be wit-\nnessed by family, friends, or the clinician. Non-epileptic seizures and other conversion\nsymptoms are prominent in some presentations of dissociative identity disorder, espe-\ncially in some non-Western settings.\nThe dissociative amnesia of individuals with dissociative identity disorder manifests in\nthree primary ways: as 1) gaps in remote memory of personal life events (e.g., periods of\nchildhood or adolescence; some important life events, such as the death of a grandparent,\ngetting married, giving birth); 2) lapses in dependable memory (e.g., of what happened\ntoday, of well-learned skills such as how to do their job, use a computer, read, drive); and\n3) discovery of evidence of their everyday actions and tasks that they do not recollect do-\ning (e.g., finding unexplained objects in their shopping bags or among their possessions;\nfinding perplexing writings or drawings that they must have created; discovering injuries;\n“coming to” in the midst of doing something). Dissociative fugues, wherein the person\ndiscovers dissociated travel, are common. Thus, individuals with dissociative identity dis-\norder may report that they have suddenly found themselves at the beach, at work, in a night-\nclub, or somewhere at home (e.g., in the closet, on a bed or sofa, in the corner) with no\nmemory of how they came to be there. Amnesia in individuals with dissociative identity dis-\norder is not limited to stressful or traumatic events; these individuals often cannot recall\neveryday events as well.\nIndividuals with dissociative identity disorder vary in their awareness and attitude to-\nward their amnesias. It is common for these individuals to minimize their amnestic symp-\ntoms. Some of their amnestic behaviors may be apparent to others—as when these persons\ndo not recall something they were witnessed to have done or said, when they cannot\nremember their own name, or when they do not recognize their spouse, children, or close\nfriends.\nPossession-form identities in dissociative identity disorder typically manifest as be-\nhaviors that appear as if a “spirit,” supernatural being, or outside person has taken control,\nsuch that the individual begins speaking or acting in a distinctly different manner. For ex-\nample, an individual’s behavior may give the appearance that her identity has been\nreplaced by the “ghost” of a girl who committed suicide in the same community years\nbefore, speaking and acting as though she were still alive. Or an individual may be “taken\nover” by a demon or deity, resulting in profound impairment, and demanding that the in-\ndividual or a relative be punished for a past act, followed by more subtle periods of iden-\ntity alteration. However, the majority of possession states around the world are normal,\nusually part of spiritual practice, and do not meet criteria for dissociative identity disor-\n294\nDissociative Disorders\nder.

They often conceal, or are not fully aware of, disruptions in consciousness, amnesia,\nor other dissociative symptoms. Many individuals with dissociative identity disorder re-\nport dissociative flashbacks during which they undergo a sensory reliving of a previous\nevent as though it were occurring in the present, often with a change of identity, a partial\nor complete loss of contact with or disorientation to current reality during the flashback,\nand a subsequent amnesia for the content of the flashback. Individuals with the disorder\ntypically report multiple types of interpersonal maltreatment during childhood and adult-\nhood. Nonmaltreatment forms of overwhelming early life events, such as multiple long,\npainful, early-life medical procedures, also may be reported. Self-mutilation and suicidal\nbehavior are frequent. On standardized measures, these individuals report higher levels\nof hypnotizability and dissociativity compared with other clinical groups and healthy con-\ntrol subjects. Some individuals experience transient psychotic phenomena or episodes.\nSeveral brain regions have been implicated in the pathophysiology of dissociative identity\ndisorder, including the orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and\namygdala.", "prevalence": "The 12-month prevalence of dissociative identity disorder among adults in a small U.S.\ncommunity study was 1.5%. The prevalence across genders in that study was 1.6% for\nmales and 1.4% for females.", "development_course": "Dissociative identity disorder is associated with overwhelming experiences, traumatic\nevents, and/or abuse occurring in childhood. The full disorder may first manifest at al-\nmost any age (from earliest childhood to late life). Dissociation in children may generate\nproblems with memory, concentration, attachment, and traumatic play. Nevertheless, chil-\ndren usually do not present with identity changes; instead they present primarily with over-\nlap and interference among mental states (Criterion A phenomena), with symptoms related\nto discontinuities of experience. Sudden changes in identity during adolescence may ap-\npear to be just adolescent turmoil or the early stages of another mental disorder. Older\nindividuals may present to treatment with what appear to be late-life mood disorders, ob-\nsessive-compulsive disorder, paranoia, psychotic mood disorders, or even cognitive dis-\norders due to dissociative amnesia. In some cases, disruptive affects and memories may\nincreasingly intrude into awareness with advancing age.\nPsychological decompensation and overt changes in identity may be triggered by 1) re-\nmoval from the traumatizing situation (e.g., through leaving home); 2) the individual’s\nchildren reaching the same age at which the individual was originally abused or trauma-\ntized; 3) later traumatic experiences, even seemingly inconsequential ones, like a minor\nmotor vehicle accident; or 4) the death of, or the onset of a fatal illness in, their abuser(s).", "risk_factors": "Environmental.\nInterpersonal physical and sexual abuse is associated with an increased\nrisk of dissociative identity disorder.

Individuals with this disorder may present with prominent medically\nunexplained neurological symptoms, such as non-epileptic seizures, paralyses, or sensory\nloss, in cultural settings where such symptoms are common. Similarly, in settings where\nnormative possession is common (e.g., rural areas in the developing world, among certain\nreligious groups in the United States and Europe), the fragmented identities may take the\nform of possessing spirits, deities, demons, animals, or mythical figures. Acculturation or\nprolonged intercultural contact may shape the characteristics of the other identities (e.g.,\nidentities in India may speak English exclusively and wear Western clothes). Possession-\nform dissociative identity disorder can be distinguished from culturally accepted posses-\nsion states in that the former is involuntary, distressing, uncontrollable, and often recur-\nrent or persistent; involves conflict between the individual and his or her surrounding\nfamily, social, or work milieu; and is manifested at times and in places that violate the\nnorms of the culture or religion.", "gender_issues": "Females with dissociative identity disorder predominate in adult clinical settings but not\nin child clinical settings. Adult males with dissociative identity disorder may deny their\nsymptoms and trauma histories, and this can lead to elevated rates of false negative di-\nagnosis.

Long-term supportive treatment may\nslowly increase these individuals’ ability to manage their symptoms and decrease use of\nmore restrictive levels of care.", "differential_diagnosis": "Other specified dissociative disorder.\nThe core of dissociative identity disorder is the\ndivision of identity, with recurrent disruption of conscious functioning and sense of self.\nThis central feature is shared with one form of other specified dissociative disorder, which\nmay be distinguished from dissociative identity disorder by the presence of chronic or re-\ncurrent mixed dissociative symptoms that do not meet Criterion A for dissociative identity\ndisorder or are not accompanied by recurrent amnesia.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nIndividuals with dissociative identity disorder are often de-\npressed, and their symptoms may appear to meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.\nRigorous assessment indicates that this depression in some cases does not meet full criteria for\nmajor depressive disorder. Other specified depressive disorder in individuals with dissocia-\ntive identity disorder often has an important feature: the depressed mood and cognitions fluc-\ntuate because they are experienced in some identity states but not others.\nBipolar disorders.\nIndividuals with dissociative identity disorder are often misdiag-\nnosed with a bipolar disorder, most often bipolar II disorder. The relatively rapid shifts in\nmood in individuals with this disorder—typically within minutes or hours, in contrast to\nthe slower mood changes typically seen in individuals with bipolar disorders—are due to\nthe rapid, subjective shifts in mood commonly reported across dissociative states, some-\ntimes accompanied by fluctuation in levels of activation. Furthermore, in dissociative\nidentity disorder, elevated or depressed mood may be displayed in conjunction with overt\nidentities, so one or the other mood may predominate for a relatively long period of time\n(often for days) or may shift within minutes.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder.\nSome traumatized individuals have both posttraumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD) and dissociative identity disorder. Accordingly, it is crucial to dis-\ntinguish between individuals with PTSD only and individuals who have both PTSD and\ndissociative identity disorder. This differential diagnosis requires that the clinician estab-\nlish the presence or absence of dissociative symptoms that are not characteristic of acute\nstress disorder or PTSD. Some individuals with PTSD manifest dissociative symptoms that\nalso occur in dissociative identity disorder: 1) amnesia for some aspects of trauma, 2) dis-\nsociative flashbacks (i.e., reliving of the trauma, with reduced awareness of one’s current\norientation), and 3) symptoms of intrusion and avoidance, negative alterations in cogni-\ntion and mood, and hyperarousal that are focused around the traumatic event. On the other\nhand, individuals with dissociative identity disorder manifest dissociative symptoms that\nare not a manifestation of PTSD: 1) amnesias for many everyday (i.e., nontraumatic) events,\n2) dissociative flashbacks that may be followed by amnesia for the content of the flashback,\n3) disruptive intrusions (unrelated to traumatic material) by dissociated identity states\ninto the individual’s sense of self and agency, and 4) infrequent, full-blown changes\namong different identity states.\nPsychotic disorders.\nDissociative identity disorder may be confused with schizophre-\nnia or other psychotic disorders. The personified, internally communicative inner voices\nof dissociative identity disorder, especially of a child (e.g., “I hear a little girl crying in a\ncloset and an angry man yelling at her”), may be mistaken for psychotic hallucinations.\nDissociative experiences of identity fragmentation or possession, and of perceived loss of\ncontrol over thoughts, feelings, impulses, and acts, may be confused with signs of formal\nthought disorder, such as thought insertion or withdrawal. Individuals with dissociative\nidentity disorder may also report visual, tactile, olfactory, gustatory, and somatic halluci-\nnations, which are usually related to posttraumatic and dissociative factors, such as partial\nDissociative Identity Disorder\n297\nflashbacks. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder experience these symptoms as\ncaused by alternate identities, do not have delusional explanations for the phenomena,\nand often describe the symptoms in a personified way (e.g., “I feel like someone else wants\nto cry with my eyes”). Persecutory and derogatory internal voices in dissociative identity\ndisorder associated with depressive symptoms may be misdiagnosed as major depression\nwith psychotic features. Chaotic identity change and acute intrusions that disrupt thought\nprocesses may be distinguished from brief psychotic disorder by the predominance of dis-\nsociative symptoms and amnesia for the episode, and diagnostic evaluation after cessation\nof the crisis can help confirm the diagnosis.\nSubstance/medication-induced disorders.\nSymptoms associated with the physiological\neffects of a substance can be distinguished from dissociative identity disorder if the sub-\nstance in question is judged to be etiologically related to the disturbance.\nPersonality disorders.\nIndividuals with dissociative identity disorder often present identi-\nties that appear to encapsulate a variety of severe personality disorder features, suggesting ahowever, the individual’s longitudinal variability in personality style (due to inconsistency\namong identities) differs from the pervasive and persistent dysfunction in affect management\nand interpersonal relationships typical of those with personality disorders.\nConversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).\nThis disorder may be\ndistinguished from dissociative identity disorder by the absence of an identity disruption\ncharacterized by two or more distinct personality states or an experience of possession.\nDissociative amnesia in conversion disorder is more limited and circumscribed (e.g., am-\nnesia for a non-epileptic seizure).\nSeizure disorders.\nIndividuals with dissociative identity disorder may present with sei-\nzurelike symptoms and behaviors that resemble complex partial seizures with temporal\nlobe foci. These include déjà vu, jamais vu, depersonalization, derealization, out-of-body\nexperiences, amnesia, disruptions of consciousness, hallucinations, and other intrusion\nphenomena of sensation, affect, and thought. Normal electroencephalographic findings,\nincluding telemetry, differentiate non-epileptic seizures from the seizurelike symptoms of\ndissociative identity disorder. Also, individuals with dissociative identity disorder obtain\nvery high dissociation scores, whereas individuals with complex partial seizures do not.\nFactitious disorder and malingering.\nIndividuals who feign dissociative identity disor-\nder do not report the subtle symptoms of intrusion characteristic of the disorder; instead\nthey tend to overreport well-publicized symptoms of the disorder, such as dissociative\namnesia, while underreporting less-publicized comorbid symptoms, such as depression.\nIndividuals who feign dissociative identity disorder tend to be relatively undisturbed by\nor may even seem to enjoy “having” the disorder. In contrast, individuals with genuine\ndissociative identity disorder tend to be ashamed of and overwhelmed by their symptoms\nand to underreport their symptoms or deny their condition. Sequential observation, cor-\nroborating history, and intensive psychometric and psychological assessment may be\nhelpful in assessment.\nIndividuals who malinger dissociative identity disorder usually create limited, stereo-\ntyped alternate identities, with feigned amnesia, related to the events for which gain is\nsought. For example, they may present an “all-good” identity and an “all-bad” identity in\nhopes of gaining exculpation for a crime.", "comorbidity": "Many individuals with dissociative identity disorder present with a comorbid disorder. If\nnot assessed and treated specifically for the dissociative disorder, these individuals often\nreceive prolonged treatment for the comorbid diagnosis only, with limited overall treat-\nment response and resultant demoralization, and disability.\n298\nDissociative Disorders\nIndividuals with dissociative identity disorder usually exhibit a large number of co-\nmorbid disorders. In particular, most develop PTSD.

Some individuals report both localized and selective am-\nnesias.\nGeneralized amnesia, a complete loss of memory for one’s life history, is rare. Individuals\nwith generalized amnesia may forget personal identity. Some lose previous knowledge\nabout the world (i.e., semantic knowledge) and can no longer access well-learned skills\nDissociative Amnesia\n299\n(i.e., procedural knowledge). Generalized amnesia has an acute onset; the perplexity, dis-\norientation, and purposeless wandering of individuals with generalized amnesia usually\nbring them to the attention of the police or psychiatric emergency services. Generalized\namnesia may be more common among combat veterans, sexual assault victims, and indi-\nviduals experiencing extreme emotional stress or conflict.\nIndividuals with dissociative amnesia are frequently unaware (or only partially aware)\nof their memory problems. Many, especially those with localized amnesia, minimize the\nimportance of their memory loss and may become uncomfortable when prompted to ad-\ndress it. In systematized amnesia, the individual loses memory for a specific category of in-\nformation (e.g., all memories relating to one’s family, a particular person, or childhood\nsexual abuse). In continuous amnesia, an individual forgets each new event as it occurs.", "associated_features": "Many individuals with dissociative amnesia are chronically impaired in their ability to\nform and sustain satisfactory relationships. Histories of trauma, child abuse, and victim-\nization are common. Some individuals with dissociative amnesia report dissociative flash-\nbacks (i.e., behavioral reexperiencing of traumatic events). Many have a history of self-\nmutilation, suicide attempts, and other high-risk behaviors. Depressive and functional\nneurological symptoms are common, as are depersonalization, auto-hypnotic symptoms,\nand high hypnotizability. Sexual dysfunctions are common. Mild traumatic brain injury\nmay precede dissociative amnesia.", "prevalence": "The 12-month prevalence for dissociative amnesia among adults in a small U.S. commu-\nnity study was 1.8% (1.0% for males; 2.6% for females).", "development_course": "Onset of generalized amnesia is usually sudden. Less is known about the onset of localized\nand selective amnesias because these amnesias are seldom evident, even to the individual.\nAlthough overwhelming or intolerable events typically precede localized amnesia, its on-\nset may be delayed for hours, days, or longer.\nIndividuals may report multiple episodes of dissociative amnesia. A single episode\nmay predispose to future episodes. In between episodes of amnesia, the individual may or\nmay not appear to be acutely symptomatic. The duration of the forgotten events can range\nfrom minutes to decades. Some episodes of dissociative amnesia resolve rapidly (e.g.,\nwhen the person is removed from combat or some other stressful situation), whereas other\nepisodes persist for long periods of time. Some individuals may gradually recall the dis-\nsociated memories years later. Dissociative capacities may decline with age, but not al-\nways. As the amnesia remits, there may be considerable distress, suicidal behavior, and\nsymptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nDissociative amnesia has been observed in young children, adolescents, and adults.\nChildren may be the most difficult to evaluate because they often have difficulty under-\nstanding questions about amnesia, and interviewers may find it difficult to formulate child-\nfriendly questions about memory and amnesia. Observations of apparent dissociative am-\nnesia are often difficult to differentiate from inattention, absorption, anxiety, oppositional\nbehavior, and learning disorders. Reports from several different sources (e.g., teacher,\ntherapist, case worker) may be needed to diagnose amnesia in children.", "risk_factors": "Environmental.\nSingle or repeated traumatic experiences (e.g., war, childhood maltreat-\nment, natural disaster, internment in concentration camps, genocide) are common ante-\n300\nDissociative Disorders\ncedents. Dissociative amnesia is more likely to occur with 1) a greater number of adverse\nchildhood experiences, particularly physical and/or sexual abuse, 2) interpersonal vio-\nlence; and 3) increased severity, frequency, and violence of the trauma.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThere are no genetic studies of dissociative amnesia. Stud-\nies of dissociation report significant genetic and environmental factors in both clinical and\nnonclinical samples.\nCourse modifiers.\nRemoval from the traumatic circumstances underlying the dissociative\namnesia (e.g., combat) may bring about a rapid return of memory. The memory loss of indi-\nviduals with dissociative fugue may be particularly refractory. Onset of PTSD symptoms may\ndecrease localized, selective, or systematized amnesia. The returning memory, however, may\nbe experienced as flashbacks that alternate with amnesia for the content of the flashbacks.", "cultural_issues": "In Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, non-epileptic seizures and other functional\nneurological symptoms may accompany dissociative amnesia. In cultures with highly re-\nstrictive social traditions, the precipitants of dissociative amnesia often do not involve\nfrank trauma.

Individuals with chronic generalized dissociative am-\nnesia usually have impairment in all aspects of functioning. Even when these individuals\n“re-learn” aspects of their life history, autobiographical memory remains very impaired.\nMost become vocationally and interpersonally disabled.", "differential_diagnosis": "Dissociative identity disorder.\nIndividuals with dissociative amnesia may report de-\npersonalization and auto-hypnotic symptoms. Individuals with dissociative identity dis-\norder report pervasive discontinuities in sense of self and agency, accompanied by many\nother dissociative symptoms. The amnesias of individuals with localized, selective, and/\nor systematized dissociative amnesias are relatively stable. Amnesias in dissociative iden-\ntity disorder include amnesia for everyday events, finding of unexplained possessions,\nsudden fluctuations in skills and knowledge, major gaps in recall of life history, and brief\namnesic gaps in interpersonal interactions.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder.\nSome individuals with PTSD cannot recall part or all of\na specific traumatic event (e.g., a rape victim with depersonalization and/or derealization\nsymptoms who cannot recall most events for the entire day of the rape). When that amne-\nsia extends beyond the immediate time of the trauma, a comorbid diagnosis of dissociative\namnesia is warranted.\nNeurocognitive disorders.\nIn neurocognitive disorders, memory loss for personal infor-\nmation is usually embedded in cognitive, linguistic, affective, attentional, and behavioral\nDissociative Amnesia\n301\ndisturbances. In dissociative amnesia, memory deficits are primarily for autobiographical\ninformation; intellectual and cognitive abilities are preserved.\nSubstance-related disorders.\nIn the context of repeated intoxication with alcohol or\nother substances/medications, there may be episodes of “black outs” or periods for which the\nindividual has no memory. To aid in distinguishing these episodes from dissociative am-\nnesia, a longitudinal history noting that the amnestic episodes occur only in the context of\nintoxication and do not occur in other situations would help identify the source as sub-\nstance-induced; however the distinction may be difficult when the individual with dis-\nsociative amnesia may also misuse alcohol or other substances in the context of stressful\nsituations that may also exacerbate dissociative symptoms. Some individuals with comor-\nbid dissociative amnesia and substance use disorders will attribute their memory prob-\nlems solely to the substance use. Prolonged use of alcohol or other substances may result in\na substance-induced neurocognitive disorder that may be associated with impaired cog-\nnitive function, but in this context the protracted history of substance use and the persis-\ntent deficits associated with the neurocognitive disorder would serve to distinguish it\nfrom dissociative amnesia, where there is typically no evidence of persistent impairment in\nintellectual functioning.\nPosttraumatic amnesia due to brain injury.\nAmnesia may occur in the context of a trau-\nmatic brain injury (TBI) when there has been an impact to the head or other mechanisms of\nrapid movement or displacement of the brain within the skull TBI. Other characteristics of\nTBI include loss of consciousness, disorientation and confusion, or, in more severe cases,\nneurological signs (e.g., abnormalities on neuroimaging, a new onset of seizures or a marked\nworsening of a preexisting seizure disorder, visual field cuts, anosmia). A neurocognitive\ndisorder attributable to TBI must present either immediately after brain injury occurs or im-\nmediately after the individual recovers consciousness after the injury, and persist past the\nacute post-injury period. The cognitive presentation of a neurocognitive disorder following\nTBI is variable and includes difficulties in the domains of complex attention, executive func-\ntion, learning and memory as well as slowed speed of information processing and distur-\nbances in social cognition. These additional features help distinguish it from dissociative\namnesia.\nSeizure disorders.\nIndividuals with seizure disorders may exhibit complex behavior dur-\ning seizures or post-ictally with subsequent amnesia. Some individuals with a seizure disorder\nengage in nonpurposive wandering that is limited to the period of seizure activity. Con-\nversely, behavior during a dissociative fugue is usually purposeful, complex, and goal-\ndirected and may last for days, weeks, or longer. Occasionally, individuals with a seizure dis-\norder will report that earlier autobiographical memories have been “wiped out” as the seizure\ndisorder progresses. Such memory loss is not associated with traumatic circumstances and ap-\npears to occur randomly. Serial electroencephalograms usually show abnormalities. Telemet-\nric electroencephalographic monitoring usually shows an association between the episodes of\namnesia and seizure activity. Dissociative and epileptic amnesias may coexist.\nCatatonic stupor.\nMutism in catatonic stupor may suggest dissociative amnesia, but fail-\nure of recall is absent. Other catatonic symptoms (e.g., rigidity, posturing, negativism) are\nusually present.\nFactitious disorder and malingering.\nThere is no test, battery of tests, or set of procedures\nthat invariably distinguishes dissociative amnesia from feigned amnesia. Individuals with\nfactitious disorder or malingering have been noted to continue their deception even during\nhypnotic or barbiturate-facilitated interviews. Feigned amnesia is more common in individ-\nuals with 1) acute, florid dissociative amnesia; 2) financial, sexual, or legal problems; or 3) a\nwish to escape stressful circumstances. True amnesia can be associated with those same cir-\ncumstances. Many individuals who malinger confess spontaneously or when confronted.\n302\nDissociative Disorders\nNormal and age-related changes in memory.\nMemory decrements in major and mild\nneurocognitive disorders differ from those of dissociative amnesia, which are usually as-\nsociated with stressful events and are more specific, extensive, and/or complex.", "comorbidity": "As dissociative amnesia begins to remit, a wide variety of affective phenomena may sur-\nface: dysphoria, grief, rage, shame, guilt, psychological conflict and turmoil, and suicidal\nand homicidal ideation, impulses, and acts.

The individual may feel detached\nfrom his or her entire being (e.g., “I am no one,” “I have no self”). He or she may also feel\nsubjectively detached from aspects of the self, including feelings (e.g., hypoemotionality:\nDepersonalization/Derealization Disorder\n303\n“I know I have feelings but I don’t feel them”), thoughts (e.g., “My thoughts don’t feel like\nmy own,” “head filled with cotton”), whole body or body parts, or sensations (e.g., touch,\nproprioception, hunger, thirst, libido). There may also be a diminished sense of agency\n(e.g., feeling robotic, like an automaton; lacking control of one’s speech or movements).\nThe depersonalization experience can sometimes be one of a split self, with one part ob-\nserving and one participating, known as an “out-of-body experience” in its most extreme\nform. The unitary symptom of “depersonalization” consists of several symptom factors:\nanomalous body experiences (i.e., unreality of the self and perceptual alterations); emo-\ntional or physical numbing; and temporal distortions with anomalous subjective recall.\nEpisodes of derealization are characterized by a feeling of unreality or detachment\nfrom, or unfamiliarity with, the world, be it individuals, inanimate objects, or all surround-\nings (Criterion A2).

Immature defenses such as idealization/devaluation, projec-\ntion and acting out result in denial of reality and poor adaptation. Cognitive disconnection\nschemata reflect defectiveness and emotional inhibition and subsume themes of abuse, ne-\nglect, and deprivation. Overconnection schemata involve impaired autonomy with themes\nof dependency, vulnerability, and incompetence.\nEnvironmental.\nThere is a clear association between the disorder and childhood interper-\nsonal traumas in a substantial portion of individuals, although this association is not as prev-\nalent or as extreme in the nature of the traumas as in other dissociative disorders, such as\ndissociative identity disorder. In particular, emotional abuse and emotional neglect have been\nmost strongly and consistently associated with the disorder. Other stressors can include phys-\nical abuse; witnessing domestic violence; growing up with a seriously impaired, mentally ill\nparent; or unexpected death or suicide of a family member or close friend. Sexual abuse is a\nmuch less common antecedent but can be encountered. The most common proximal precipi-\ntants of the disorder are severe stress (interpersonal, financial, occupational), depression, anx-\niety (particularly panic attacks), and illicit drug use. Symptoms may be specifically induced by\nsubstances such as tetrahydrocannabinol, hallucinogens, ketamine, MDMA (3,4-methylene-\ndioxymethamphetamine; “ecstasy”) and salvia.

However, in depersonalization/\nderealization disorder, such symptoms are associated with further symptoms of the dis-\norder. If the depersonalization/derealization clearly precedes the onset of a major depres-\nsive episode or clearly continues after its resolution, the diagnosis of depersonalization/\nderealization disorder applies.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nSome individuals with depersonalization/dereal-\nization disorder can become obsessively preoccupied with their subjective experience or\ndevelop rituals checking on the status of their symptoms. However, other symptoms of\nobsessive-compulsive disorder unrelated to depersonalization/derealization are not\npresent.\nOther dissociative disorders.\nIn order to diagnose depersonalization/derealization\ndisorder, the symptoms should not occur in the context of another dissociative disorder,\nsuch as dissociative identity disorder. Differentiation from dissociative amnesia and con-\nversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder) is simpler, as the symptoms\nof these disorders do not overlap with those of depersonalization/derealization disorder.\nAnxiety disorders.\nDepersonalization/derealization is one of the symptoms of panic at-\ntacks, increasingly common as panic attack severity increases. Therefore, depersonal-\nization/derealization disorder should not be diagnosed when the symptoms occur only\nduring panic attacks that are part of panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, or specific\nphobia. In addition, it is not uncommon for depersonalization/derealization symptoms\nto first begin in the context of new-onset panic attacks or as panic disorder progresses and\nworsens. In such presentations, the diagnosis of depersonalization/derealization disorder\ncan be made if 1) the depersonalization/derealization component of the presentation is\nvery prominent from the start, clearly exceeding in duration and intensity the occurrence\nof actual panic attacks; or 2) the depersonalization/derealization continues after panic dis-\norder has remitted or has been successfully treated.\nPsychotic disorders.\nThe presence of intact reality testing specifically regarding the\ndepersonalization/derealization symptoms is essential to differentiating depersonal-\nization/derealization disorder from psychotic disorders. Rarely, positive-symptom\nschizophrenia can pose a diagnostic challenge when nihilistic delusions are present. For\nexample, an individual may complain that he or she is dead or the world is not real; this\ncould be either a subjective experience that the individual knows is not true or a delusional\nconviction.\nSubstance/medication-induced disorders.\nDepersonalization/derealization associated\nwith the physiological effects of substances during acute intoxication or withdrawal is not\ndiagnosed as depersonalization/derealization disorder. The most common precipitating\nsubstances are the illicit drugs marijuana, hallucinogens, ketamine, ecstasy, and salvia. In\n306\nDissociative Disorders\nabout 15% of all cases of depersonalization/derealization disorder, the symptoms are pre-\ncipitated by ingestion of such substances. If the symptoms persist for some time in the ab-\nsence of any further substance or medication use, the diagnosis of depersonalization/\nderealization disorder applies. This diagnosis is usually easy to establish since the vast ma-\njority of individuals with this presentation become highly phobic and aversive to the trig-\ngering substance and do not use it again.\nMental disorders due to another medical condition.\nFeatures such as onset after age\n40 years or the presence of atypical symptoms and course in any individual suggest the\npossibility of an underlying medical condition. In such cases, it is essential to conduct a\nthorough medical and neurological evaluation, which may include standard laboratory\nstudies, viral titers, an electroencephalogram, vestibular testing, visual testing, sleep stud-\nies, and/or brain imaging.

A diagnosis of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder requires\nthat the disturbance of intake is beyond that directly accounted for by physical symptoms con-\nsistent with a medical condition; the eating disturbance may also persist after being triggered\nby a medical condition and following resolution of the medical condition.\nUnderlying medical or comorbid mental conditions may complicate feeding and eating.\nBecause older individuals, postsurgical patients, and individuals receiving chemotherapy\noften lose their appetite, an additional diagnosis of avoidant/restrictive food intake dis-\norder requires that the eating disturbance is a primary focus for intervention.\nSpecific neurological/neuromuscular, structural, or congenital disorders and condi-\ntions associated with feeding difficulties.\nFeeding difficulties are common in a number\nof congenital and neurological conditions often related to problems with oral/esophageal/\npharyngeal structure and function, such as hypotonia of musculature, tongue protrusion,\nand unsafe swallowing. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder can be diagnosed in in-\ndividuals with such presentations as long as all diagnostic criteria are met.\nReactive attachment disorder.\nSome degree of withdrawal is characteristic of reactive\nattachment disorder and can lead to a disturbance in the caregiver-child relationship that\ncan affect feeding and the child’s intake. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should\nbe diagnosed concurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and the feeding\ndisturbance is a primary focus for intervention.\nAutism spectrum disorder.\nIndividuals with autism spectrum disorder often present with\nrigid eating behaviors and heightened sensory sensitivities. However, these features do\nnot always result in the level of impairment that would be required for a diagnosis of\navoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should\nbe diagnosed concurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and when the eat-\ning disturbance requires specific treatment.\nSpecific phobia, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), and other anxiety disorders.\nSpecific phobia, other type, specifies “situations that may lead to choking or vomiting” and\ncan represent the primary trigger for the fear, anxiety, or avoidance required for diagnosis.\nDistinguishing specific phobia from avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder can be dif-\nficult when a fear of choking or vomiting has resulted in food avoidance. Although avoid-\nance or restriction of food intake secondary to a pronounced fear of choking or vomiting\ncan be conceptualized as specific phobia, in situations when the eating problem becomes\nthe primary focus of clinical attention, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder becomes\nthe appropriate diagnosis. In social anxiety disorder, the individual may present with a\nfear of being observed by others while eating, which can also occur in avoidant/restrictive\nfood intake disorder.\nAnorexia nervosa.\nRestriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to sig-\nnificantly low body weight is a core feature of anorexia nervosa. However, individuals\nwith anorexia nervosa also display a fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persis-\ntent behavior that interferes with weight gain, as well as specific disturbances in relation to\nperception and experience of their own body weight and shape. These features are not\npresent in avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, and the two disorders should not be\ndiagnosed concurrently. Differential diagnosis between avoidant/restrictive food intake\ndisorder and anorexia nervosa may be difficult, especially in late childhood and early ad-\nolescence, because these disorders may share a number of common symptoms (e.g., food\navoidance, low weight). Differential diagnosis is also potentially difficult in individuals\nwith anorexia nervosa who deny any fear of fatness but nonetheless engage in persistent\nbehaviors that prevent weight gain and who do not recognize the medical seriousness of\ntheir low weight—a presentation sometimes termed “non-fat phobic anorexia nervosa.”\nFull consideration of symptoms, course, and family history is advised, and diagnosis may\n338\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\nbe best made in the context of a clinical relationship over time. In some individuals, avoid-\nant/restrictive food intake disorder might precede the onset of anorexia nervosa.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nIndividuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder may\npresent with avoidance or restriction of intake in relation to preoccupations with food or\nritualized eating behavior. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should be diagnosed\nconcurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and when the aberrant eating is\na major aspect of the clinical presentation requiring specific intervention.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nIn major depressive disorder, appetite might be affected to\nsuch an extent that individuals present with significantly restricted food intake, usually in\nrelation to overall energy intake and often associated with weight loss. Usually appetite\nloss and related reduction of intake abate with resolution of mood problems. Avoidant/\nrestrictive food intake disorder should only be used concurrently if full criteria are met for\nboth disorders and when the eating disturbance requires specific treatment.\nSchizophrenia spectrum disorders.\nIndividuals with schizophrenia, delusional disor-\nder, or other psychotic disorders may exhibit odd eating behaviors, avoidance of specific\nfoods because of delusional beliefs, or other manifestations of avoidant or restrictive in-\ntake. In some cases, delusional beliefs may contribute to a concern about negative conse-\nquences of ingesting certain foods. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should be\nused concurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and when the eating dis-\nturbance requires specific treatment.\nFactitious disorder or factitious disorder imposed on another.\nAvoidant/restrictive\nfood intake disorder should be differentiated from factitious disorder or factitious disor-\nder imposed on another. In order to assume the sick role, some individuals with factitious\ndisorder may intentionally describe diets that are much more restrictive than those they\nare actually able to consume, as well as complications of such behavior, such as a need for\nenteral feedings or nutritional supplements, an inability to tolerate a normal range of\nfoods, and/or an inability to participate normally in age-appropriate situations involving\nfood. The presentation may be impressively dramatic and engaging, and the symptoms re-\nported inconsistently. In factitious disorder imposed on another, the caregiver describes\nsymptoms consistent with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder and may induce\nphysical symptoms such as failure to gain weight. As with any diagnosis of factitious dis-\norder imposed on another, the caregiver receives the diagnosis rather than the affected in-\ndividual, and diagnosis should be made only on the basis of a careful, comprehensive\nassessment of the affected individual, the caregiver, and their interaction.", "comorbidity": "The most commonly observed disorders comorbid with avoidant/restrictive food intake\ndisorder are anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and neurodevelopmental\ndisorders (specifically autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disor-\nder, and intellectual disability [intellectual developmental disorder])."}, "provenance": {"source_file": "feeding_eating_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 3, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.462383"}}

The context in which the eating occurs may affect the clinician’s\nestimation of whether the intake is excessive. For example, a quantity of food that might be\nregarded as excessive for a typical meal might be considered normal during a celebration\nor holiday meal. A “discrete period of time” refers to a limited period, usually less than\n2 hours. A single episode of binge eating need not be restricted to one setting. For example,\nan individual may begin a binge in a restaurant and then continue to eat on returning\nhome. Continual snacking on small amounts of food throughout the day would not be con-\nsidered an eating binge.\nAn occurrence of excessive food consumption must be accompanied by a sense of lack\nof control (Criterion A2) to be considered an episode of binge eating. An indicator of loss\nof control is the inability to refrain from eating or to stop eating once started. Some indi-\nviduals describe a dissociative quality during, or following, the binge-eating episodes. The\nimpairment in control associated with binge eating may not be absolute; for example, an\nindividual may continue binge eating while the telephone is ringing but will cease if a\nroommate or spouse unexpectedly enters the room. Some individuals report that their\nbinge-eating episodes are no longer characterized by an acute feeling of loss of control but\nrather by a more generalized pattern of uncontrolled eating. If individuals report that they\nhave abandoned efforts to control their eating, loss of control may still be considered as\npresent. Binge eating can also be planned in some instances.\nThe type of food consumed during binges varies both across individuals and for a given\nindividual. Binge eating appears to be characterized more by an abnormality in the amount\nof food consumed than by a craving for a specific nutrient.\nBinge eating must be characterized by marked distress (Criterion C) and at least three\nof the following features: eating much more rapidly than normal; eating until feeling un-\ncomfortably full; eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry; eating\nalone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is eating; and feeling disgusted\nwith oneself, depressed, or very guilty afterward (Criterion B).\nIndividuals with binge-eating disorder are typically ashamed of their eating problems\nand attempt to conceal their symptoms. Binge eating usually occurs in secrecy or as incon-\nspicuously as possible. The most common antecedent of binge eating is negative affect.\nOther triggers include interpersonal stressors; dietary restraint; negative feelings related\nto body weight, body shape, and food; and boredom.

As secondary\nsex characteristics of young adolescents are not yet fully developed, these individuals may\nnot state dislike of them, but they are concerned about imminent physical changes.\nIn adults with gender dysphoria, the discrepancy between experienced gender and\nphysical sex characteristics is often, but not always, accompanied by a desire to be rid of\nprimary and/or secondary sex characteristics and/or a strong desire to acquire some pri-\nmary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender. To varying degrees, adults\nwith gender dysphoria may adopt the behavior, clothing, and mannerisms of the experi-\nenced gender. They feel uncomfortable being regarded by others, or functioning in soci-\nety, as members of their assigned gender. Some adults may have a strong desire to be of a\ndifferent gender and treated as such, and they may have an inner certainty to feel and re-\nspond as the experienced gender without seeking medical treatment to alter body char-\nacteristics. They may find other ways to resolve the incongruence between experienced/\nexpressed and assigned gender by partially living in the desired role or by adopting a gen-\nder role neither conventionally male nor conventionally female.", "associated_features": "When visible signs of puberty develop, natal boys may shave their legs at the first signs of\nhair growth. They sometimes bind their genitals to make erections less visible. Girls may\nbind their breasts, walk with a stoop, or use loose sweaters to make breasts less visible. In-\ncreasingly, adolescents request, or may obtain without medical prescription and supervi-\nsion, hormonal suppressors (“blockers”) of gonadal steroids (e.g., gonadotropin-releasing\nhormone [GnRH] analog, spironolactone). Clinically referred adolescents often want hor-\nmone treatment and many also wish for gender reassignment surgery. Adolescents living in\nan accepting environment may openly express the desire to be and be treated as the experi-\nenced gender and dress partly or completely as the experienced gender, have a hairstyle typ-\nical of the experienced gender, preferentially seek friendships with peers of the other gender,\nand/or adopt a new first name consistent with the experienced gender. Older adolescents,\nwhen sexually active, usually do not show or allow partners to touch their sexual organs. For\nadults with an aversion toward their genitals, sexual activity is constrained by the preference\nthat their genitals not be seen or touched by their partners. Some adults may seek hormone\ntreatment (sometimes without medical prescription and supervision) and gender reassign-\nment surgery. Others are satisfied with either hormone treatment or surgery alone.\nAdolescents and adults with gender dysphoria before gender reassignment are at in-\ncreased risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicides. After gender reassign-\nment, adjustment may vary, and suicide risk may persist.", "prevalence": "For natal adult males, prevalence ranges from 0.005% to 0.014%, and for natal females,\nfrom 0.002% to 0.003%. Since not all adults seeking hormone treatment and surgical reas-\nsignment attend specialty clinics, these rates are likely modest underestimates. Sex differ-\nences in rate of referrals to specialty clinics vary by age group. In children, sex ratios of\nnatal boys to girls range from 2:1 to 4.5:1. In adolescents, the sex ratio is close to parity; in\nadults, the sex ratio favors natal males, with ratios ranging from 1:1 to 6.1:1. In two coun-\ntries, the sex ratio appears to favor natal females (Japan: 2.2:1; Poland: 3.4:1).", "development_course": "Because expression of gender dysphoria varies with age, there are separate criteria sets for\nchildren versus adolescents and adults. Criteria for children are defined in a more con-\nGender Dysphoria\n455\ncrete, behavioral manner than those for adolescents and adults. Many of the core criteria\ndraw on well-documented behavioral gender differences between typically developing\nboys and girls. Young children are less likely than older children, adolescents, and adults\nto express extreme and persistent anatomic dysphoria. In adolescents and adults, incon-\ngruence between experienced gender and somatic sex is a central feature of the diagnosis.\nFactors related to distress and impairment also vary with age. A very young child may\nshow signs of distress (e.g., intense crying) only when parents tell the child that he or she\nis “really” not a member of the other gender but only “desires” to be. Distress may not be\nmanifest in social environments supportive of the child’s desire to live in the role of the\nother gender and may emerge only if the desire is interfered with. In adolescents and\nadults, distress may manifest because of strong incongruence between experienced gender\nand somatic sex. Such distress may, however, be mitigated by supportive environments and\nknowledge that biomedical treatments exist to reduce incongruence. Impairment (e.g.,\nschool refusal, development of depression, anxiety, and substance abuse) may be a conse-\nquence of gender dysphoria.\nGender dysphoria without a disorder of sex development.\nFor clinic-referred children,\nonset of cross-gender behaviors is usually between ages 2 and 4 years. This corresponds to\nthe developmental time period in which most typically developing children begin ex-\npressing gendered behaviors and interests. For some preschool-age children, both perva-\nsive cross-gender behaviors and the expressed desire to be the other gender may be\npresent, or, more rarely, labeling oneself as a member of the other gender may occur. In\nsome cases, the expressed desire to be the other gender appears later, usually at entry into\nelementary school. A small minority of children express discomfort with their sexual anat-\nomy or will state the desire to have a sexual anatomy corresponding to the experienced\ngender (“anatomic dysphoria”). Expressions of anatomic dysphoria become more com-\nmon as children with gender dysphoria approach and anticipate puberty.\nRates of persistence of gender dysphoria from childhood into adolescence or adulthood\nvary. In natal males, persistence has ranged from 2.2% to 30%. In natal females, persistence\nhas ranged from 12% to 50%. Persistence of gender dysphoria is modestly correlated with\ndimensional measures of severity ascertained at the time of a childhood baseline assess-\nment. In one sample of natal males, lower socioeconomic background was also modestly\ncorrelated with persistence. It is unclear if particular therapeutic approaches to gender\ndysphoria in children are related to rates of long-term persistence. Extant follow-up sam-\nples consisted of children receiving no formal therapeutic intervention or receiving ther-\napeutic interventions of various types, ranging from active efforts to reduce gender\ndysphoria to a more neutral, “watchful waiting” approach. It is unclear if children “en-\ncouraged” or supported to live socially in the desired gender will show higher rates of per-\nsistence, since such children have not yet been followed longitudinally in a systematic\nmanner. For both natal male and female children showing persistence, almost all are\nsexually attracted to individuals of their natal sex. For natal male children whose gender\ndysphoria does not persist, the majority are androphilic (sexually attracted to males) and of-\nten self-identify as gay or homosexual (ranging from 63% to 100%). In natal female chil-\ndren whose gender dysphoria does not persist, the percentage who are gynephilic (sexually\nattracted to females) and self-identify as lesbian is lower (ranging from 32% to 50%).\nIn both adolescent and adult natal males, there are two broad trajectories for develop-\nment of gender dysphoria: early onset and late onset. Early-onset gender dysphoria starts in\nchildhood and continues into adolescence and adulthood; or, there is an intermittent pe-\nriod in which the gender dysphoria desists and these individuals self-identify as gay or ho-\nmosexual, followed by recurrence of gender dysphoria. Late-onset gender dysphoria occurs\naround puberty or much later in life. Some of these individuals report having had a desire\nto be of the other gender in childhood that was not expressed verbally to others. Others do\nnot recall any signs of childhood gender dysphoria. For adolescent males with late-onset\ngender dysphoria, parents often report surprise because they did not see signs of gender\n456\nGender Dysphoria\ndysphoria during childhood. Expressions of anatomic dysphoria are more common and\nsalient in adolescents and adults once secondary sex characteristics have developed.\nAdolescent and adult natal males with early-onset gender dysphoria are almost al-\nways sexually attracted to men (androphilic). Adolescents and adults with late-onset gen-\nder dysphoria frequently engage in transvestic behavior with sexual excitement. The\nmajority of these individuals are gynephilic or sexually attracted to other posttransition\nnatal males with late-onset gender dysphoria. A substantial percentage of adult males\nwith late-onset gender dysphoria cohabit with or are married to natal females. After gen-\nder transition, many self-identify as lesbian. Among adult natal males with gender dyspho-\nria, the early-onset group seeks out clinical care for hormone treatment and reassignment\nsurgery at an earlier age than does the late-onset group. The late-onset group may have more\nfluctuations in the degree of gender dysphoria and be more ambivalent about and less\nlikely satisfied after gender reassignment surgery.\nIn both adolescent and adult natal females, the most common course is the early-onset\nform of gender dysphoria. The late-onset form is much less common in natal females com-\npared with natal males. As in natal males with gender dysphoria, there may have been a\nperiod in which the gender dysphoria desisted and these individuals self-identified as les-\nbian; however, with recurrence of gender dysphoria, clinical consultation is sought, often\nwith the desire for hormone treatment and reassignment surgery. Parents of natal adoles-\ncent females with the late-onset form also report surprise, as no signs of childhood gender\ndysphoria were evident. Expressions of anatomic dysphoria are much more common and\nsalient in adolescents and adults than in children.\nAdolescent and adult natal females with early-onset gender dysphoria are almost\nalways gynephilic. Adolescents and adults with the late-onset form of gender dysphoria\nare usually androphilic and after gender transition self-identify as gay men. Natal females\nwith the late-onset form do not have co-occurring transvestic behavior with sexual ex-\ncitement.\nGender dysphoria in association with a disorder of sex development.\nMost individuals\nwith a disorder of sex development who develop gender dysphoria have already come to\nmedical attention at an early age. For many, starting at birth, issues of gender assignment\nwere raised by physicians and parents. Moreover, as infertility is quite common for this\ngroup, physicians are more willing to perform cross-sex hormone treatments and genital\nsurgery before adulthood.\nDisorders of sex development in general are frequently associated with gender-atypi-\ncal behavior starting in early childhood. However, in the majority of cases, this does not\nlead to gender dysphoria. As individuals with a disorder of sex development become\naware of their medical history and condition, many experience uncertainty about their\ngender, as opposed to developing a firm conviction that they are another gender. How-\never, most do not progress to gender transition. Gender dysphoria and gender transition\nmay vary considerably as a function of a disorder of sex development, its severity, and as-\nsigned gender.", "risk_factors": "Temperamental.\nFor individuals with gender dysphoria without a disorder of sex de-\nvelopment, atypical gender behavior among individuals with early-onset gender dyspho-\nria develops in early preschool age, and it is possible that a high degree of atypicality\nmakes the development of gender dysphoria and its persistence into adolescence and\nadulthood more likely.\nEnvironmental.\nAmong individuals with gender dysphoria without a disorder of sex de-\nvelopment, males with gender dysphoria (in both childhood and adolescence) more com-\nmonly have older brothers than do males without the condition. Additional predisposing\nGender Dysphoria\n457\nfactors under consideration, especially in individuals with late-onset gender dysphoria (ad-\nolescence, adulthood), include habitual fetishistic transvestism developing into autogyne-\nphilia (i.e., sexual arousal associated with the thought or image of oneself as a woman) and\nother forms of more general social, psychological, or developmental problems.\nGenetic and physiological.\nFor individuals with gender dysphoria without a disorder of\nsex development, some genetic contribution is suggested by evidence for (weak) familial-\nity of transsexualism among nontwin siblings, increased concordance for transsexualism\nin monozygotic compared with dizygotic same-sex twins, and some degree of heritability\nof gender dysphoria. As to endocrine findings, no endogenous systemic abnormalities in\nsex-hormone levels have been found in 46,XY individuals, whereas there appear to be in-\ncreased androgen levels (in the range found in hirsute women but far below normal male\nlevels) in 46,XX individuals. Overall, current evidence is insufficient to label gender dys-\nphoria without a disorder of sex development as a form of intersexuality limited to the cen-\ntral nervous system.\nIn gender dysphoria associated with a disorder of sex development, the likelihood of\nlater gender dysphoria is increased if prenatal production and utilization (via receptor\nsensitivity) of androgens are grossly atypical relative to what is usually seen in individuals\nwith the same assigned gender. Examples include 46,XY individuals with a history of nor-\nmal male prenatal hormone milieu but inborn nonhormonal genital defects (as in cloacal\nbladder exstrophy or penile agenesis) and who have been assigned to the female gender.\nThe likelihood of gender dysphoria is further enhanced by additional, prolonged, highly\ngender-atypical postnatal androgen exposure with somatic virilization as may occur in fe-\nmale-raised and noncastrated 46,XY individuals with 5-alpha reductase-2 deficiency or\n17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-3 deficiency or in female-raised 46,XX individuals\nwith classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia with prolonged periods of non-adherence to\nglucocorticoid replacement therapy. However, the prenatal androgen milieu is more\nclosely related to gendered behavior than to gender identity. Many individuals with dis-\norders of sex development and markedly gender-atypical behavior do not develop gender\ndysphoria. Thus, gender-atypical behavior by itself should not be interpreted as an indi-\ncator of current or future gender dysphoria. There appears to be a higher rate of gender\ndysphoria and patient-initiated gender change from assigned female to male than from as-\nsigned male to female in 46,XY individuals with a disorder of sex development.", "cultural_issues": "Individuals with gender dysphoria have been reported across many countries and cul-\ntures. The equivalent of gender dysphoria has also been reported in individuals living in\ncultures with institutionalized gender categories other than male or female.

Some children may refuse to attend school because of teasing and harass-\n458\nGender Dysphoria\nment or pressure to dress in attire associated with their assigned sex. Also in adolescents\nand adults, preoccupation with cross-gender wishes often interferes with daily activities.\nRelationship difficulties, including sexual relationship problems, are common, and func-\ntioning at school or at work may be impaired. Gender dysphoria, along with atypical\ngender expression, is associated with high levels of stigmatization, discrimination, and\nvictimization, leading to negative self-concept, increased rates of mental disorder comor-\nbidity, school dropout, and economic marginalization, including unemployment, with at-\ntendant social and mental health risks, especially in individuals from resource-poor family\nbackgrounds. In addition, these individuals’ access to health services and mental health\nservices may be impeded by structural barriers, such as institutional discomfort or inex-\nperience in working with this patient population.", "differential_diagnosis": "Nonconformity to gender roles.\nGender dysphoria should be distinguished from sim-\nple nonconformity to stereotypical gender role behavior by the strong desire to be of an-\nother gender than the assigned one and by the extent and pervasiveness of gender-variant\nactivities and interests. The diagnosis is not meant to merely describe nonconformity to\nstereotypical gender role behavior (e.g., “tomboyism” in girls, “girly-boy” behavior in\nboys, occasional cross-dressing in adult men). Given the increased openness of atypical\ngender expressions by individuals across the entire range of the transgender spectrum, it\nis important that the clinical diagnosis be limited to those individuals whose distress and\nimpairment meet the specified criteria.\nTransvestic disorder.\nTransvestic disorder occurs in heterosexual (or bisexual) adoles-\ncent and adult males (rarely in females) for whom cross-dressing behavior generates sex-\nual excitement and causes distress and/or impairment without drawing their primary\ngender into question. It is occasionally accompanied by gender dysphoria. An individual\nwith transvestic disorder who also has clinically significant gender dysphoria can be given\nboth diagnoses. In many cases of late-onset gender dysphoria in gynephilic natal males,\ntransvestic behavior with sexual excitement is a precursor.\nBody dysmorphic disorder.\nAn individual with body dysmorphic disorder focuses on\nthe alteration or removal of a specific body part because it is perceived as abnormally formed,\nnot because it represents a repudiated assigned gender. When an individual’s presenta-\ntion meets criteria for both gender dysphoria and body dysmorphic disorder, both diag-\nnoses can be given. Individuals wishing to have a healthy limb amputated (termed by\nsome body integrity identity disorder) because it makes them feel more “complete” usually\ndo not wish to change gender, but rather desire to live as an amputee or a disabled person.\nSchizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.\nIn schizophrenia, there may rarely be\ndelusions of belonging to some other gender. In the absence of psychotic symptoms, in-\nsistence by an individual with gender dysphoria that he or she is of some other gender is\nnot considered a delusion. Schizophrenia (or other psychotic disorders) and gender dys-\nphoria may co-occur.\nOther clinical presentations.\nSome individuals with an emasculinization desire who\ndevelop an alternative, nonmale/nonfemale gender identity do have a presentation that\nmeets criteria for gender dysphoria. However, some males seek castration and/or penec-\ntomy for aesthetic reasons or to remove psychological effects of androgens without chang-\ning male identity; in these cases, the criteria for gender dysphoria are not met.", "comorbidity": "Clinically referred children with gender dysphoria show elevated levels of emotional and\nbehavioral problems—most commonly, anxiety, disruptive and impulse-control, and de-\nOther Specified Gender Dysphoria\n459\npressive disorders.

In older children, gender-variant behavior often leads to\npeer ostracism, which may lead to more behavioral problems. The prevalence of mental\nhealth problems differs among cultures; these differences may also be related to differences\nin attitudes toward gender variance in children. However, also in some non-Western cul-\ntures, anxiety has been found to be relatively common in individuals with gender dysphoria,\neven in cultures with accepting attitudes toward gender-variant behavior. Autism spec-\ntrum disorder is more prevalent in clinically referred children with gender dysphoria than\nin the general population. Clinically referred adolescents with gender dysphoria appear to\nhave comorbid mental disorders, with anxiety and depressive disorders being the most\ncommon.

The\ndomains thus defined, along with guidelines for clinical thresholds, form the basis on\nwhich the NCDs, their levels, and their subtypes may be diagnosed.\nNeurocognitive Disorders\n593\nTABLE 1 Neurocognitive domains\nCognitive domain\nExamples of symptoms or observations\nExamples of assessments \nComplex attention \n(sustained attention, \ndivided attention, \nselective attention, \nprocessing speed)\nMajor: Has increased difficulty in environments with multiple \nstimuli (TV, radio, conversation); is easily distracted by compet-\ning events in the environment. Is unable to attend unless input is \nrestricted and simplified. Has difficulty holding new information \nin mind, such as recalling phone numbers or addresses just given, \nor reporting what was just said. Is unable to perform mental cal-\nculations. All thinking takes longer than usual, and components \nto be processed must be simplified to one or a few.\nMild: Normal tasks take longer than previously. Begins to find \nerrors in routine tasks; finds work needs more double-checking \nthan previously. Thinking is easier when not competing with \nother things (radio, TV, other conversations, cell phone, driving).\nSustained attention: Maintenance of attention over time (e.g., pressing \na button every time a tone is heard, and over a period of time). \nSelective attention: Maintenance of attention despite competing stim-\nuli and/or distractors: hearing numbers and letters read and asked \nto count only letters.\nDivided attention: Attending to two tasks within the same time \nperiod: rapidly tapping while learning a story being read. Process-\ning speed can be quantified on any task by timing it (e.g., time to \nput together a design of blocks; time to match symbols with num-\nbers; speed in responding, such as counting speed or serial 3 \nspeed). \nExecutive function \n(planning, decision \nmaking, working \nmemory, respond-\ning to feedback/\nerror correction, \noverriding habits/\ninhibition, mental \nflexibility)\nMajor: Abandons complex projects. Needs to focus on one task \nat a time. Needs to rely on others to plan instrumental activi-\nties of daily living or make decisions. \nMild: Increased effort required to complete multistage projects. \nHas increased difficulty multitasking or difficulty resuming a \ntask interrupted by a visitor or phone call. May complain of \nincreased fatigue from the extra effort required to organize, \nplan, and make decisions. May report that large social gather-\nings are more taxing or less enjoyable because of increased \neffort required to follow shifting conversations.\nPlanning: Ability to find the exit to a maze; interpret a sequential pic-\nture or object arrangement.\nDecision making: Performance of tasks that assess process of deciding \nin the face of competing alternatives (e.g., simulated gambling).\nWorking memory: Ability to hold information for a brief period and to \nmanipulate it (e.g., adding up a list of numbers or repeating a series \nof numbers or words backward).\nFeedback/error utilization: Ability to benefit from feedback to infer the \nrules for solving a problem.\nOverriding habits/inhibition: Ability to choose a more complex and \neffortful solution to be correct (e.g., looking away from the direc-\ntion indicated by an arrow; naming the color of a word’s font rather \nthan naming the word).\nMental/cognitive flexibility: Ability to shift between two concepts, \ntasks, or response rules (e.g., from number to letter, from verbal to \nkey-press response, from adding numbers to ordering numbers, \nfrom ordering objects by size to ordering by color).\n594\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nLearning and mem-\nory (immediate \nmemory, recent \nmemory [including \nfree recall, cued \nrecall, and recogni-\ntion memory], \nvery-long-term \nmemory [semantic; \nautobiographical], \nimplicit learning) \nMajor: Repeats self in conversation, often within the same con-\nversation. Cannot keep track of short list of items when shop-\nping or of plans for the day. Requires frequent reminders to \norient to task at hand.\nMild: Has difficulty recalling recent events, and relies increas-\ningly on list making or calendar. Needs occasional reminders \nor re-reading to keep track of characters in a movie or novel. \nOccasionally may repeat self over a few weeks to the same per-\nson. Loses track of whether bills have already been paid.\nNote: Except in severe forms of major neurocognitive disorder, \nsemantic, autobiographical, and implicit memory are rela-\ntively preserved, compared with recent memory. \nImmediate memory span: Ability to repeat a list of words or digits. \nNote: Immediate memory sometimes subsumed under “working \nmemory” (see “Executive Function”).\nRecent memory: Assesses the process of encoding new information \n(e.g., word lists, a short story, or diagrams). The aspects of recent \nmemory that can be tested include 1) free recall (the person is asked \nto recall as many words, diagrams, or elements of a story as possi-\nble); 2) cued recall (examiner aids recall by providing semantic cues \nsuch as “List all the food items on the list” or “Name all of the chil-\ndren from the story”); and 3) recognition memory (examiner asks \nabout specific items—e.g., “Was ’apple’ on the list?”  or “Did you \nsee this diagram or figure?”). Other aspects of memory that can be \nassessed include semantic memory (memory for facts), autobio-\ngraphical memory (memory for personal events or people), and \nimplicit (procedural) learning (unconscious learning of skills).\nLanguage (expres-\nsive language \n[including nam-\ning, word finding, \nfluency, and gram-\nmar, and syntax] \nand receptive \nlanguage)\nMajor: Has significant difficulties with expressive or receptive \nlanguage. Often uses general-use phrases such as “that thing” \nand “you know what I mean,” and prefers general pronouns \nrather than names. With severe impairment, may not even \nrecall names of closer friends and family. Idiosyncratic word \nusage, grammatical errors, and spontaneity of output and \neconomy of utterances occur. Stereotypy of speech occurs; \necholalia and automatic speech typically precede mutism.\nMild: Has noticeable word-finding difficulty. May substitute \ngeneral for specific terms. May avoid use of specific names of \nacquaintances. Grammatical errors involve subtle omission or \nincorrect use of articles, prepositions, auxiliary verbs, etc. \nExpressive language: Confrontational naming (identification of objects \nor pictures); fluency (e.g., name as many items as possible in a \nsemantic [e.g., animals] or phonemic [e.g., words starting with “f”] \ncategory in 1 minute).\nGrammar and syntax (e.g., omission or incorrect use of articles, prep-\nositions, auxiliary verbs): Errors observed during naming and flu-\nency tests are compared with norms to assess frequency of errors \nand compare with normal slips of the tongue.\nReceptive language: Comprehension (word definition and object-\npointing tasks involving animate and inanimate stimuli): perfor-\nmance of actions/activities according to verbal command.\nTABLE 1 Neurocognitive domains (continued)\nCognitive domain\nExamples of symptoms or observations\nExamples of assessments \nNeurocognitive Disorders\n595\nPerceptual-motor \n(includes abilities \nsubsumed under \nthe terms visual \nperception, visuo-\nconstructional, \nperceptual-motor, \npraxis, and gnosis) \nMajor: Has significant difficulties with previously familiar activ-\nities (using tools, driving motor vehicle), navigating in familiar \nenvironments; is often more confused at dusk, when shadows \nand lowering levels of light change perceptions. \nMild: May need to rely more on maps or others for directions. \nUses notes and follows others to get to a new place. May find \nself lost or turned around when not concentrating on task. Is \nless precise in parking. Needs to expend greater effort for spa-\ntial tasks such as carpentry, assembly, sewing, or knitting.\nVisual perception: Line bisection tasks can be used to detect basic \nvisual defect or attentional neglect. Motor-free perceptual tasks \n(including facial recognition) require the identification and/or \nmatching of figures—best when tasks cannot be verbally mediated \n(e.g., figures are not objects); some require the decision of whether \na figure can be “real” or not based on dimensionality.  \nVisuoconstructional: Assembly of items requiring hand-eye coordina-\ntion, such as drawing, copying, and block assembly. \nPerceptual-motor: Integrating perception with purposeful movement \n(e.g., inserting blocks into a form board without visual cues; rap-\nidly inserting pegs into a slotted board).\nPraxis: Integrity of learned movements, such as ability to imitate \ngestures (wave goodbye) or pantomime use of objects to command \n(“Show me how you would use a hammer”).\nGnosis: Perceptual integrity of awareness and recognition, such as \nrecognition of faces and colors.\nSocial cognition \n(recognition of \nemotions, theory \nof mind)\nMajor: Behavior clearly out of acceptable social range; shows \ninsensitivity to social standards of modesty in dress or of polit-\nical, religious, or sexual topics of conversation. Focuses exces-\nsively on a topic despite group’s disinterest or direct feedback. \nBehavioral intention without regard to family or friends. \nMakes decisions without regard to safety (e.g., inappropriate \nclothing for weather or social setting). Typically, has little \ninsight into these changes.\nMild: Has subtle changes in behavior or attitude, often described \nas a change in personality, such as less ability to recognize \nsocial cues or read facial expressions, decreased empathy, \nincreased extraversion or introversion, decreased inhibition, \nor subtle or episodic apathy or restlessness.\nRecognition of emotions: Identification of emotion in images of faces \nrepresenting a variety of both positive and negative emotions.\nTheory of mind: Ability to consider another person’s mental state \n(thoughts, desires, intentions) or experience—story cards with \nquestions to elicit information about the mental state of the individ-\nuals portrayed, such as “Where will the girl look for the lost bag?” \nor “Why is the boy sad?”  \nTABLE 1 Neurocognitive domains (continued)\nCognitive domain\nExamples of symptoms or observations\nExamples of assessments \n596\nNeurocognitive Disorders", "subtypes": "", "specifiers": "", "recording_procedures": "", "diagnostic_features": "", "associated_features": "", "prevalence": "", "development_course": "", "risk_factors": "", "cultural_issues": "", "gender_issues": "", "diagnostic_markers": "", "suicide_risk": "", "functional_consequences": "", "differential_diagnosis": "", "comorbidity": ""}, "provenance": {"source_file": "neurocognitive_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 1, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.468383"}}

The\ndiagnostic code is selected from substance-specific codes included in the coding note included\nDelirium\n599\nin the criteria set. The name of the disorder is followed by the course (i.e., acute, persistent), fol-\nlowed by the specifier indicating level of psychomotor activity (i.e., hyperactive, hypoactive,\nmixed level of activity). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the\nsubstance/medication withdrawal delirium and substance use disorder into a single code, for\nICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in\nthe case of acute hyperactive withdrawal delirium occurring in a man with a severe alcohol use\ndisorder, the diagnosis is 291.0 alcohol withdrawal delirium, acute, hyperactive. An additional\ndiagnosis of 303.90 severe alcohol use disorder is also given.\nICD-10-CM.\nThe name of the substance/medication withdrawal delirium begins with\nthe specific substance (e.g., alcohol) that is presumed to be causing the withdrawal delir-\nium. The diagnostic code is selected from substance-specific codes included in the coding\nnote included in the criteria set. When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid\nmoderate or severe substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word\n“with,” followed by the substance withdrawal delirium, followed by the course (i.e., acute,\npersistent), followed by the specifier indicating level of psychomotor activity (i.e., hyper-\nactive, hypoactive, mixed level of activity). For example, in the case of acute hyperactive\nwithdrawal delirium occurring in a man with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis\nis F10.231 severe alcohol use disorder with alcohol withdrawal delirium, acute, hyperac-\ntive. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe alcohol use disorder is not given.\nMedication-induced delirium.\nThe name of the medication-induced delirium begins\nwith the specific substance (e.g., dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the de-\nlirium. The name of the disorder is followed by the course (i.e., acute, persistent), followed\nby the specifier indicating level of psychomotor activity (i.e., hyperactive, hypoactive,\nmixed level of activity). For example, in the case of acute hyperactive medication-induced\ndelirium occurring in a man using dexamethasone as prescribed, the diagnosis is 292.81\n(F19.921) dexamethasone-induced delirium, acute, hyperactive.", "diagnostic_features": "The essential feature of delirium is a disturbance of attention or awareness that is accom-\npanied by a change in baseline cognition that cannot be better explained by a preexisting\nor evolving neurocognitive disorder (NCD). The disturbance in attention (Criterion A) is\nmanifested by reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift attention. Questions must\nbe repeated because the individual’s attention wanders, or the individual may perseverate\nwith an answer to a previous question rather than appropriately shift attention. The indi-\nvidual is easily distracted by irrelevant stimuli. The disturbance in awareness is mani-\nfested by a reduced orientation to the environment or at times even to oneself.\nThe disturbance develops over a short period of time, usually hours to a few days, and\ntends to fluctuate during the course of the day, often with worsening in the evening and\nnight when external orienting stimuli decrease (Criterion B). There is evidence from the\nhistory, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is a physiologi-\ncal consequence of an underlying medical condition, substance intoxication or with-\ndrawal, use of a medication, or a toxin exposure, or a combination of these factors\n(Criterion E). The etiology should be coded according to the etiologically appropriate sub-\ntype (i.e., substance or medication intoxication, substance withdrawal, another medical\n600\nNeurocognitive Disorders\ncondition, or multiple etiologies). Delirium often occurs in the context of an underlying\nNCD. The impaired brain function of individuals with mild and major NCD renders them\nmore vulnerable to delirium.\nThere is an accompanying change in at least one other area that may include memory\nand learning (particularly recent memory), disorientation (particularly to time and place),\nalteration in language, or perceptual distortion or a perceptual-motor disturbance (Crite-\nrion C). The perceptual disturbances accompanying delirium include misinterpretations,\nillusions, or hallucinations; these disturbances are typically visual, but may occur in other\nmodalities as well, and range from simple and uniform to highly complex. Normal atten-\ntion/arousal, delirium, and coma lie on a continuum, with coma defined as the lack of any\nresponse to verbal stimuli. The ability to evaluate cognition to diagnose delirium depends\non there being a level of arousal sufficient for response to verbal stimulation; hence, delir-\nium should not be diagnosed in the context of coma (Criterion D). Many noncomatose pa-\ntients have a reduced level of arousal. Those patients who show only minimal responses to\nverbal stimulation are incapable of engaging with attempts at standardized testing or even\ninterview. This inability to engage should be classified as severe inattention. Low-arousal\nstates (of acute onset) should be recognized as indicating severe inattention and cognitive\nchange, and hence delirium. They are clinically indistinguishable from delirium diag-\nnosed on the basis of inattention or cognitive change elicited through cognitive testing and\ninterview.", "associated_features": "Delirium is often associated with a disturbance in the sleep-wake cycle. This disturbance\ncan include daytime sleepiness, nighttime agitation, difficulty falling asleep, excessive\nsleepiness throughout the day, or wakefulness throughout the night. In some cases, com-\nplete reversal of the night-day sleep-wake cycle can occur. Sleep-wake cycle disturbances\nare very common in delirium and have been proposed as a core criterion for the diagnosis.\nThe individual with delirium may exhibit emotional disturbances, such as anxiety,\nfear, depression, irritability, anger, euphoria, and apathy. There may be rapid and unpre-\ndictable shifts from one emotional state to another. The disturbed emotional state may also\nbe evident in calling out, screaming, cursing, muttering, moaning, or making other\nsounds. These behaviors are especially prevalent at night and under conditions in which\nstimulation and environmental cues are lacking.", "prevalence": "The prevalence of delirium is highest among hospitalized older individuals and varies\ndepending on the individuals’ characteristics, setting of care, and sensitivity of the detec-\ntion method. The prevalence of delirium in the community overall is low (1%–2%) but in-\ncreases with age, rising to 14% among individuals older than 85 years. The prevalence is\n10%–30% in older individuals presenting to emergency departments, where the delirium\noften indicates a medical illness.\nThe prevalence of delirium when individuals are admitted to the hospital ranges from\n14% to 24%, and estimates of the incidence of delirium arising during hospitalization\nrange from 6% to 56% in general hospital populations. Delirium occurs in 15%–53% of\nolder individuals postoperatively and in 70%–87% of those in intensive care. Delirium oc-\ncurs in up to 60% of individuals in nursing homes or post–acute care settings and in up to\n83% of all individuals at the end of life.", "development_course": "While the majority of individuals with delirium have a full recovery with or without\ntreatment, early recognition and intervention usually shortens the duration of the delir-\nDelirium\n601\nium. Delirium may progress to stupor, coma, seizures, or death, particularly if the under-\nlying cause remains untreated. Mortality among hospitalized individuals with delirium is\nhigh, and as many as 40% of individuals with delirium, particularly those with malignan-\ncies and other significant underlying medical illness, die within a year after diagnosis.", "risk_factors": "Environmental.\nDelirium may be increased in the context of functional impairment, im-\nmobility, a history of falls, low levels of activity, and use of drugs and medications with\npsychoactive properties (particularly alcohol and anticholinergics).\nGenetic and physiological.\nBoth major and mild NCDs can increase the risk for delir-\nium and complicate the course. Older individuals are especially susceptible to delirium\ncompared with younger adults. Susceptibility to delirium in infancy and through child-\nhood may be greater than in early and middle adulthood. In childhood, delirium may be\nrelated to febrile illnesses and certain medications (e.g., anticholinergics).", "cultural_issues": "", "gender_issues": "", "diagnostic_markers": "In addition to laboratory findings characteristic of underlying medical conditions (or in-\ntoxication or withdrawal states), there is often generalized slowing on electroencephalog-\nraphy, and fast activity is occasionally found (e.g., in some cases of alcohol withdrawal\ndelirium). However, electroencephalography is insufficiently sensitive and specific for di-\nagnostic use.", "suicide_risk": "", "functional_consequences": "Delirium itself is associated with increased functional decline and risk of institutional\nplacement. Hospitalized individuals 65 years or older with delirium have three times the\nrisk of nursing home placement and about three times the functional decline as hospital-\nized patients without delirium at both discharge and 3 months postdischarge.", "differential_diagnosis": "Psychotic disorders and bipolar and depressive disorders with psychotic features.\nDelirium that is characterized by vivid hallucinations, delusions, language disturbances,\nand agitation must be distinguished from brief psychotic disorder, schizophrenia, schizo-\nphreniform disorder, and other psychotic disorders, as well as from bipolar and depres-\nsive disorders with psychotic features.\nAcute stress disorder.\nDelirium associated with fear, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms,\nsuch as depersonalization, must be distinguished from acute stress disorder, which is pre-\ncipitated by exposure to a severely traumatic event.\nMalingering and factitious disorder.\nDelirium can be distinguished from these disor-\nders on the basis of the often atypical presentation in malingering and factitious disorder\nand the absence of another medical condition or substance that is etiologically related to\nthe apparent cognitive disturbance.\nOther neurocognitive disorders.\nThe most common differential diagnostic issue when\nevaluating confusion in older adults is disentangling symptoms of delirium and dementia.\nThe clinician must determine whether the individual has delirium; a delirium superim-\nposed on a preexisting NCD, such as that due to Alzheimer’s disease; or an NCD without\ndelirium. The traditional distinction between delirium and dementia according to acute-\nness of onset and temporal course is particularly difficult in those elderly individuals who\nhad a prior NCD that may not have been recognized, or who develop persistent cognitive\nimpairment following an episode of delirium.\n602\nNeurocognitive Disorders", "comorbidity": ""}, "provenance": {"source_file": "neurocognitive_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 2, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.468383"}}

Note that the ICD-\n10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present\nfor the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the sub-\nstance-induced neurocognitive disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician\nshould record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced neurocognitive\ndisorder (e.g., “mild inhalant use disorder with inhalant-induced major neurocognitive disor-\nder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-\ninduced neurocognitive disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should\nrecord “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending\non the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance\nuse disorder, then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the\nsubstance-induced neurocognitive disorder. For some classes of substances (i.e., alcohol;\nsedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics), it is not permissible to code a comorbid mild substance\nuse disorder with a substance-induced neurocognitive disorder; only a comorbid moderate\nor severe substance use disorder, or no substance use disorder, can be diagnosed.

These subtypes are distinguished on the basis of a combination of time course, charac-\nteristic domains affected, and associated symptoms. For certain etiological subtypes, the\ndiagnosis depends substantially on the presence of a potentially causative entity, such as Par-\nkinson’s or Huntington’s disease, or a traumatic brain injury or stroke in the appropriate time\nperiod. For other etiological subtypes (generally the neurodegenerative diseases like Alzhei-\nmer’s disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and Lewy body disease), the diagnosis is\nbased primarily on the cognitive, behavioral, and functional symptoms. Typically, the differ-\nentiation among these syndromes that lack an independently recognized etiological entity is\nclearer at the level of major NCD than at the level of mild NCD, but sometimes characteristic\nsymptoms and associated features are present at the mild level as well.\nNCDs are frequently managed by clinicians in multiple disciplines. For many sub-\ntypes, multidisciplinary international expert groups have developed specialized consen-\nsus criteria based on clinicopathological correlation with underlying brain pathology. The\nsubtype criteria here have been harmonized with those expert criteria.exclusively or primarily in late life. Even within the NCDs of aging, the relative prevalence\nvaries with age: Alzheimer’s disease is uncommon before age 60 years, and the prevalence\nincreases steeply thereafter, while the overall less common frontotemporal lobar degener-\nation has earlier onset and represents a progressively smaller fraction of NCDs with age.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThe strongest risk factor for major and mild NCDs is age,\nprimarily because age increases the risk of neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular dis-\nease. Female gender is associated with higher prevalence of dementia overall, and especially\nAlzheimer’s disease, but this difference is largely, if not wholly, attributable to greater lon-\ngevity in females.", "specifiers": "Evidence for distinct behavioral features in NCDs has been recognized, particularly in the\nareas of psychotic symptoms and depression. Psychotic features are common in many\nNCDs, particularly at the mild-to-moderate stage of major NCDs due to Alzheimer’s dis-\nease, Lewy body disease, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Paranoia and other\ndelusions are common features, and often a persecutory theme may be a prominent aspect\nof delusional ideation. In contrast to psychotic disorders with onset in earlier life (e.g.,\nschizophrenia), disorganized speech and disorganized behavior are not characteristic of\npsychosis in NCDs. Hallucinations may occur in any modality, although visual hallucina-\ntions are more common in NCDs than in depressive, bipolar, or psychotic disorders.\nMood disturbances, including depression, anxiety, and elation, may occur. Depression\nis common early in the course (including at the mild NCD level) of NCD due to Alzhei-\nmer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, while elation may occur more commonly in fron-\ntotemporal lobar degeneration. When a full affective syndrome meeting diagnostic criteria\nfor a depressive or bipolar disorder is present, that diagnosis should be coded as well.\nMood symptoms are increasingly recognized to be a significant feature in the earliest stages\nof mild NCDs such that clinical recognition and intervention may be important.\nAgitation is common in a wide variety of NCDs, particularly in major NCD of moder-\nate to severe severity, and often occurs in the setting of confusion or frustration. It may\narise as combative behaviors, particularly in the context of resisting caregiving duties such\nas bathing and dressing. Agitation is characterized as disruptive motor or vocal activity\nand tends to occur with advanced stages of cognitive impairment across all of the NCDs.\nIndividuals with NCD can present with a wide variety of behavioral symptoms that\nare the focus of treatment. Sleep disturbance is a common symptom that can create a need\nfor clinical attention and may include symptoms of insomnia, hypersomnia, and circadian\nrhythm disturbances.\nMajor and Mild Neurocognitive Disorders\n607\nApathy is common in mild and mild major NCD. It is observed particularly in NCD due\nto Alzheimer’s disease and may be a prominent feature of NCD due to frontotemporal\nlobar degeneration. Apathy is typically characterized by diminished motivation and re-\nduced goal-directed behavior accompanied by decreased emotional responsiveness.\nSymptoms of apathy may manifest early in the course of NCDs when a loss of motivation\nto pursue daily activities or hobbies may be observed.\nOther important behavioral symptoms include wandering, disinhibition, hyperpha-\ngia, and hoarding. Some of these symptoms are characteristic of specific disorders, as dis-\ncussed in the relevant sections. When more than one behavioral disturbance is observed,\neach type should be noted in writing with the specifier “with behavioral symptoms.”Rate the severity of the neurocognitive disorder (NCD), not the underlying traumatic brain\ninjury (see the section “Development and Course” for this disorder).", "recording_procedures": "ICD-9-CM.\nThe name of the substance/medication-induced neurocognitive disorder be-\ngins with the specific substance/medication (e.g., alcohol) that is presumed to be causing\nthe neurocognitive symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in\nthe criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of\nthe classes, the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance\nis judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the cat-\negory “unknown substance” should be used.\nThe name of the disorder (i.e., [specific substance]-induced major neurocognitive dis-\norder or [specific substance]-induced mild neurocognitive disorder) is followed by the\ntype in the case of alcohol (i.e., nonamnestic-confabulatory type, amnestic-confabulatory\ntype), followed by specification of duration (i.e., persistent). Unlike the recording procedures\nfor ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance/medication-induced disorder and sub-\nstance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for\nthe substance use disorder. For example, in the case of persistent amnestic-confabulatory\nsymptoms in a man with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is 291.1 alcohol-\ninduced major neurocognitive disorder, amnestic-confabulatory type, persistent. An addi-\ntional diagnosis of 303.90 severe alcohol use disorder is also given. If the substance/medi-\ncation-induced neurocognitive disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder\n(e.g., after a sporadic heavy use of inhalants), no accompanying substance use disorder is\nnoted (e.g., 292.82 inhalant-induced mild neurocognitive disorder).\nICD-10-CM.\nThe name of the substance/medication-induced neurocognitive disorder\nbegins with the specific substance (e.g., alcohol) that is presumed to be causing the neuro-\ncognitive symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria\nset, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use\ndisorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes, the code for “other sub-\nstance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological fac-\ntor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance”\nshould be used.\nWhen recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is\nlisted first, followed by the word “with,” followed by the name of the disorder (i.e., [specific\nsubstance]-induced major neurocognitive disorder or [specific substance]-induced mild\nneurocognitive disorder), followed by the type in the case of alcohol (i.e., nonamnestic-con-\nfabulatory type, amnestic-confabulatory type), followed by specification of duration (i.e.,\npersistent). For example, in the case of persistent amnestic-confabulatory symptoms in a\nman with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is F10.26 severe alcohol use disorder\nwith alcohol-induced major neurocognitive disorder, amnestic-confabulatory type, persis-\ntent. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe alcohol use disorder is not given. If the\nsubstance-induced neurocognitive disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use dis-\norder (e.g., after a sporadic heavy use of inhalants), no accompanying substance use disor-\nder is noted (e.g., F18.988 inhalant-induced mild neurocognitive disorder).", "diagnostic_features": "Major and mild NCDs exist on a spectrum of cognitive and functional impairment. Major\nNCD corresponds to the condition referred to in DSM-IV as dementia, retained as an alter-\nnative in this volume. The core feature of NCDs is acquired cognitive decline in one or\nmore cognitive domains (Criterion A) based on both 1) a concern about cognition on the\npart of the individual, a knowledgeable informant, or the clinician, and 2) performance on\nan objective assessment that falls below the expected level or that has been observed to de-\ncline over time. Both a concern and objective evidence are required because they are com-\nplementary. When there is an exclusive focus on objective testing, a disorder may go\nundiagnosed in high-functioning individuals whose currently “normal” performance ac-\ntually represents a substantial decline in abilities, or an illness may be incorrectly diag-\nnosed in individuals whose currently “low” performance does not represent a change\nfrom their own baseline or is a result of extraneous factors like test conditions or a passing\nillness. Alternatively, excessive focus on subjective symptoms may fail to diagnose illness\nin individuals with poor insight, or whose informants deny or fail to notice their symptoms,\nor it may be overly sensitive in the so-called worried well.\nA cognitive concern differs from a complaint in that it may or may not be voiced spon-\ntaneously. Rather, it may need to be elicited by careful questioning about specific symp-\ntoms that commonly occur in individuals with cognitive deficits (see Table 1 in the\nintroduction to this chapter). For example, memory concerns include difficulty remember-\ning a short grocery list or keeping track of the plot of a television program; executive con-\ncerns include difficulty resuming a task when interrupted, organizing tax records, or\nplanning a holiday meal. At the mild NCD level, the individual is likely to describe these\ntasks as being more difficult or as requiring extra time or effort or compensatory strategies.\nAt the major NCD level, such tasks may only be completed with assistance or may be\nabandoned altogether. At the mild NCD level, individuals and their families may not no-\ntice such symptoms or may view them as normal, particularly in the elderly; thus, careful\nhistory taking is of paramount importance. The difficulties must represent changes rather\nthan lifelong patterns: the individual or informant may clarify this issue, or the clinician\ncan infer change from prior experience with the patient or from occupational or other\nclues. It is also critical to determine that the difficulties are related to cognitive loss rather\nthan to motor or sensory limitations.\nNeuropsychological testing, with performance compared with norms appropriate to\nthe patient’s age, educational attainment, and cultural background, is part of the standard\nevaluation of NCDs and is particularly critical in the evaluation of mild NCD. For major\nNCD, performance is typically 2 or more standard deviations below appropriate norms\n(3rd percentile or below). For mild NCD, performance typically lies in the 1–2 standard de-\nviation range (between the 3rd and 16th percentiles). However, neuropsychological test-\ning is not available in all settings, and neuropsychological thresholds are sensitive to the\nspecific test(s) and norms employed, as well as to test conditions, sensory limitations, and\nintercurrent illness. A variety of brief office-based or “bedside” assessments, as described\n608\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nin Table 1, can also supply objective data in settings where such testing is unavailable or\ninfeasible. In any case, as with cognitive concerns, objective performance must be inter-\npreted in light of the individual’s prior performance. Optimally, this information would\nbe available from a prior administration of the same test, but often it must be inferred\nbased on appropriate norms, along with the individual’s educational history, occupation,\nand other factors. Norms are more challenging to interpret in individuals with very high\nor very low levels of education and in individuals being tested outside their own language\nor cultural background.\nCriterion B relates to the individual’s level of independence in everyday functioning.\nIndividuals with major NCD will have impairment of sufficient severity so as to interfere\nwith independence, such that others will have to take over tasks that the individuals were\npreviously able to complete on their own. Individuals with mild NCD will have preserved\nindependence, although there may be subtle interference with function or a report that\ntasks require more effort or take more time than previously.\nThe distinction between major and mild NCD is inherently arbitrary, and the disorders\nexist along a continuum. Precise thresholds are therefore difficult to determine. Careful\nhistory taking, observation, and integration with other findings are required, and the im-\nplications of diagnosis should be considered when an individual’s clinical manifestations\nlie at a boundary.Beyond the neurocognitive disorder (NCD) syndrome (Criterion A), the core features of ma-\njor or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease include an insidious onset and gradual pro-\ngression of cognitive and behavioral symptoms (Criterion B). The typical presentation is\namnestic (i.e., with impairment in memory and learning). Unusual nonamnestic presen-\ntations, particularly visuospatial and logopenic aphasic variants, also exist. At the mild\nNCD phase, Alzheimer’s disease manifests typically with impairment in memory and learn-\ning, sometimes accompanied by deficits in executive function. At the major NCD phase,\nvisuoconstructional/perceptual-motor ability and language will also be impaired, partic-\nularly when the NCD is moderate to severe. Social cognition tends to be preserved until\nlate in the course of the disease.\nA level of diagnostic certainty must be specified denoting Alzheimer’s disease as the\n“probable” or “possible” etiology (Criterion C). Probable Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed in\nboth major and mild NCD if there is evidence of a causative Alzheimer’s disease gene, ei-\nther from genetic testing or from an autosomal dominant family history coupled with au-\ntopsy confirmation or a genetic test in an affected family member. For major NCD, a\ntypical clinical picture, without extended plateaus or evidence of mixed etiology, can also\nbe diagnosed as due to probable Alzheimer’s disease. For mild NCD, given the lesser de-\ngree of certainty that the deficits will progress, these features are only sufficient for a\npossible Alzheimer’s etiology. If the etiology appears mixed, mild NCD due to multiple eti-\nologies should be diagnosed. In any case, for both mild and major NCD due to Alzhei-\nmer’s disease, the clinical features must not suggest another primary etiology for the NCD\n(Criterion D).Major or mild frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (NCD) comprises a number of syn-\ndromic variants characterized by the progressive development of behavioral and personality\nchange and/or language impairment. The behavioral variant and three language variants (se-\nmantic, agrammatic/nonfluent, and logopenic) exhibit distinct patterns of brain atrophy and\nsome distinctive neuropathology. The criteria must be met for either the behavioral or the lan-\nguage variant to make the diagnosis, but many individuals present with features of both.\nIndividuals with behavioral-variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD present with\nvarying degrees of apathy or disinhibition. They may lose interest in socialization, self-\ncare, and personal responsibilities, or display socially inappropriate behaviors. Insight is\nusually impaired, and this often delays medical consultation. The first referral is often to a\npsychiatrist. Individuals may develop changes in social style, and in religious and political\nbeliefs, with repetitive movements, hoarding, changes in eating behavior, and hyperoral-\nity. In later stages, loss of sphincter control may occur. Cognitive decline is less prominent,\nand formal testing may show relatively few deficits in the early stages. Common neuro-\ncognitive symptoms are lack of planning and organization, distractibility, and poor judg-\nment. Deficits in executive function, such as poor performance on tests of mental\n616\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nflexibility, abstract reasoning, and response inhibition, are present, but learning and mem-\nory are relatively spared, and perceptual-motor abilities are almost always preserved in\nthe early stages.\nIndividuals with language-variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD present with pri-\nmary progressive aphasia with gradual onset, with three subtypes commonly described:\nsemantic variant, agrammatic/nonfluent variant, and logopenic variant, and each variant\nhas distinctive features and corresponding neuropathology.\n“Probable” is distinguished from “possible” frontotemporal NCD by the presence of\ncausative genetic factors (e.g., mutations in the gene coding for microtubule-associated pro-\ntein tau) or by the presence of distinctive atrophy or reduced activity in frontotemporal re-\ngions on structural or functional imaging.Major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies (NCDLB), in the case of major\nneurocognitive disorder (NCD), corresponds to the condition known as dementia with\nLewy bodies (DLB). The disorder includes not only progressive cognitive impairment\n(with early changes in complex attention and executive function rather than learning and\nmemory) but also recurrent complex visual hallucinations; and concurrent symptoms of\nrapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (which can be a very early manifes-\ntation); as well as hallucinations in other sensory modalities, depression, and delusions.\nThe symptoms fluctuate in a pattern that can resemble a delirium, but no adequate under-\nlying cause can be found. The variable presentation of NCDLB symptoms reduces the like-\nlihood of all symptoms being observed in a brief clinic visit and necessitates a thorough\nassessment of caregiver observations. The use of assessment scales specifically designed to\nassess fluctuation may aid in diagnosis. Another core feature is spontaneous parkinson-\nism, which must begin after the onset of cognitive decline; by convention, major cognitive\ndeficits are observed at least 1 year before the motor symptoms. The parkinsonism must\nalso be distinguished from neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal signs. Accurate diagnosis\nis essential to safe treatment planning, as up to 50% of individuals with NCDLB have se-\nvere sensitivity to neuroleptic drugs, and these medications should be used with extreme\ncaution in managing the psychotic manifestations.\nThe diagnosis of mild NCDLB is appropriate for individuals who present with the core\nor suggestive features at a stage when cognitive or functional impairments are not of suf-\nficient severity to fulfill criteria for major NCD. However, as for all mild NCDs, there will\noften be insufficient evidence to justify any single etiology, and use of the unspecified di-\nagnosis is most appropriate.The diagnosis of major or mild vascular neurocognitive disorder (NCD) requires the es-\ntablishment of an NCD (Criterion A) and the determination that cerebrovascular disease is\nthe dominant if not exclusive pathology that accounts for the cognitive deficits (Criteria B\nand C). Vascular etiology may range from large vessel stroke to microvascular disease; the\n622\nNeurocognitive Disorders\npresentation is therefore very heterogeneous, stemming from the types of vascular lesions\nand their extent and location. The lesions may be focal, multifocal, or diffuse and occur in\nvarious combinations.\nMany individuals with major or mild vascular NCD present with multiple infarctions,\nwith an acute stepwise or fluctuating decline in cognition, and intervening periods of\nstability and even some improvement. Others may have gradual onset with slow pro-\ngression, a rapid development of deficits followed by relative stability, or another complex\npresentation. Major or mild vascular NCD with a gradual onset and slow progression is\ngenerally due to small vessel disease leading to lesions in the white matter, basal ganglia,\nand/or thalamus. The gradual progression in these cases is often punctuated by acute\nevents that leave subtle neurological deficits. The cognitive deficits in these cases can be at-\ntributed to disruption of cortical-subcortical circuits, and complex attention, particularly\nspeed of information processing, and executive ability are likely to be affected.\nAssessing for the presence of sufficient cerebrovascular disease relies on history, phys-\nical examination, and neuroimaging (Criterion C). Etiological certainty requires the dem-\nonstration of abnormalities on neuroimaging. The lack of neuroimaging can result in\nsignificant diagnostic inaccuracy by overlooking “silent” brain infarction and white mat-\nter lesions. However, if the neurocognitive impairment is temporally associated with one\nor more well-documented strokes, a probable diagnosis can be made in the absence of neu-\nroimaging. Clinical evidence of cerebrovascular disease includes documented history of\nstroke, with cognitive decline temporally associated with the event, or physical signs con-\nsistent with stroke (e.g., hemiparesis; pseudobulbar syndrome, visual field defect). Neuro-\nimaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or computed tomography [CT]) evidence of\ncerebrovascular disease comprises one or more of the following: one or more large vessel\ninfarcts or hemorrhages, a strategically placed single infarct or hemorrhage (e.g., in angu-\nlar gyrus, thalamus, basal forebrain), two or more lacunar infarcts outside the brain stem,\nor extensive and confluent white matter lesions. The latter is often termed small vessel dis-\nease or subcortical ischemic changes on clinical neuroimaging evaluations.\nFor mild vascular NCD, history of a single stroke or extensive white matter disease is gen-\nerally sufficient. For major vascular NCD, two or more strokes, a strategically placed stroke,\nor a combination of white matter disease and one or more lacunes is generally necessary.\nThe disorder must not be better explained by another disorder. For example, promi-\nnent memory deficit early in the course might suggest Alzheimer's disease, early and\nprominent parkinsonian features would suggest Parkinson's disease, and a close associa-\ntion between onset and depression would suggest depression.Major or mild NCD due to traumatic brain injury (TBI) is caused by an impact to the head,\nor other mechanisms of rapid movement or displacement of the brain within the skull, as\ncan happen with blast injuries. Traumatic brain injury is defined as brain trauma with spe-\ncific characteristics that include at least one of the following: loss of consciousness, post-\ntraumatic amnesia, disorientation and confusion, or, in more severe cases, neurological\nsigns (e.g., positive neuroimaging, a new onset of seizures or a marked worsening of a pre-\nexisting seizure disorder, visual field cuts, anosmia, hemiparesis) (Criterion B). To be at-\ntributable to TBI, the NCD must present either immediately after the brain injury occurs or\nimmediately after the individual recovers consciousness after the injury and persist past\nthe acute post-injury period (Criterion C).\nThe cognitive presentation is variable. Difficulties in the domains of complex attention,\nexecutive ability, learning, and memory are common as well as slowing in speed of infor-\nmation processing and disturbances in social cognition. In more severe TBI in which there\nis brain contusion, intracranial hemorrhage, or penetrating injury, there may be additional\nneurocognitive deficits, such as aphasia, neglect, and constructional dyspraxia.Substance/medication-induced major or mild NCD is characterized by neurocognitive\nimpairments that persist beyond the usual duration of intoxication and acute withdrawal\n(Criterion B). Initially, these manifestations can reflect slow recovery of brain functions\nfrom a period of prolonged substance use, and improvements in neurocognitive as well as\n630\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nbrain imaging indicators may be seen over many months. If the disorder continues for an\nextended period, persistent should be specified. The given substance and its use must be\nknown to be capable of causing the observed impairments (Criterion C). While nonspecific\ndecrements in a range of cognitive abilities can occur with nearly any substance of abuse\nand a variety of medications, some patterns occur more frequently with selected drug\nclasses. For example, NCD due to sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drugs (e.g., benzodiaz-\nepines, barbiturates) may show greater disturbances in memory than in other cognitive\nfunctions. NCD induced by alcohol frequently manifests with a combination of impair-\nments in executive-function and memory and learning domains. The temporal course of\nthe substance-induced NCD must be consistent with that of use of the given substance\n(Criterion D). In alcohol-induced amnestic confabulatory (Korsakoff’s) NCD, the features\ninclude prominent amnesia (severe difficulty learning new information with rapid forget-\nting) and a tendency to confabulate. These manifestations may co-occur with signs of thi-\namine encephalopathy (Wernicke’s encephalopathy) with associated features such as\nnystagmus and ataxia. Ophthalmoplegia of Wernicke’s encephalopathy is typically charac-\nterized by a lateral gaze paralysis.\nIn addition to or independent of the more common neurocognitive symptoms related\nto methamphetamine use (e.g., difficulties with learning and memory; executive func-\ntion), methamphetamine use can also be associated with evidence of vascular injury (e.g.,\nfocal weakness, unilateral incoordination, asymmetrical reflexes). The most common neu-\nrocognitive profile approximates that seen in vascular NCD.HIV disease is caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1),\nwhich is acquired through exposure to bodily fluids of an infected person through injection\ndrug use, unprotected sexual contact, or accidental or iatrogenic exposure (e.g., contami-\nnated blood supply, needle puncture injury to medical personnel). HIV infects several types\nof cells, most particularly immune cells. Over time, the infection can cause severe depletion\nof “T-helper” (CD4) lymphocytes, resulting in severe immunocompromise, often leading to\nopportunistic infections and neoplasms. This advanced form of HIV infection is termed\nacquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Diagnosis of HIV is confirmed by established\nlaboratory methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV antibody with\nWestern blot confirmation and/or polymerase chain reaction–based assays for HIV.\nSome individuals with HIV infection develop an NCD, which generally shows a “sub-\ncortical pattern” with prominently impaired executive function, slowing of processing\nspeed, problems with more demanding attentional tasks, and difficulty in learning new\ninformation, but fewer problems with recall of learned information. In major NCD, slow-\ning may be prominent. Language difficulties, such as aphasia, are uncommon, although\nreductions in fluency may be observed. HIV pathogenic processes can affect any part of\nthe brain; therefore, other patterns are possible.\nMajor or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to HIV Infection\n633The classification of major or mild neurocognitive disorder (NCD) due to prion disease in-\ncludes NCDs due to a group of subacute spongiform encephalopathies (including Creutz-\nfeldt-Jakob disease, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, kuru, Gerstmann-Sträussler-\nScheinker syndrome, and fatal insomnia) caused by transmissible agents known as prions.\nThe most common type is sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, typically referred to as\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Variant CJD is much rarer and is associated with trans-\nmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, also called “mad cow disease.” Typically,\nindividuals with CJD present with neurocognitive deficits, ataxia, and abnormal move-\nments such as myoclonus, chorea, or dystonia; a startle reflex is also common. Typically,\nthe history reveals rapid progression to major NCD over as little as 6 months, and thus the\ndisorder is typically seen only at the major level. However, many individuals with the dis-\norder may have atypical presentations, and the disease can be confirmed only by biopsy or\nat autopsy. Individuals with variant CJD may present with a greater preponderance of\npsychiatric symptoms, characterized a by low mood, withdrawal, and anxiety. Prion dis-\nease is typically not diagnosed without at least one of the characteristic biomarker fea-\ntures: recognized lesions on magnetic resonance imaging with DWI (diffusion-weighted\nimaging) or FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery), tau or 14-3-3 protein in cerebro-\nspinal fluid, characteristic triphasic waves on electroencephalogram, or, for rare familial\nforms, family history or genetic testing.", "associated_features": "Typically the associated features that support a diagnosis of major or mild NCD will be\nspecific to the etiological subtype (e.g., neuroleptic sensitivity and visual hallucinations in\nNCD due to Lewy body disease). Diagnostic features specific to each of the subtypes are\nfound in the relevant sections.In specialty clinical settings, approximately 80% of individuals with major NCD due to\nAlzheimer’s disease have behavioral and psychological manifestations; these features are\nalso frequent at the mild NCD stage of impairment. These symptoms are as or more dis-\ntressing than cognitive manifestations and are frequently the reason that health care is\nsought. At the mild NCD stage or the mildest level of major NCD, depression and/or ap-\nathy are often seen. With moderately severe major NCD, psychotic features, irritability,\nagitation, combativeness, and wandering are common. Late in the illness, gait distur-\nbance, dysphagia, incontinence, myoclonus, and seizures are observed.Extrapyramidal features may be prominent in some cases, with an overlap with syn-\ndromes such as progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. Features of\nmotor neuron disease may be present in some cases (e.g., muscle atrophy, weakness). A\nsubset of individuals develop visual hallucinations.Individuals with NCDLB frequently experience repeated falls and syncope and transient\nepisodes of unexplained loss of consciousness. Autonomic dysfunction, such as ortho-\nstatic hypotension and urinary incontinence, may be observed. Auditory and other\nnonvisual hallucinations are common, as are systematized delusions, delusional misiden-\ntification, and depression.A neurological assessment often reveals history of stroke and/or transient ischemic epi-\nsodes, and signs indicative of brain infarctions. Also commonly associated are personality\nand mood changes, abulia, depression, and emotional lability. The development of late-\nonset depressive symptoms accompanied by psychomotor slowing and executive dys-\nfunction is a common presentation among older adults with progressive small vessel isch-\nemic disease (“vascular depression”).Major or mild NCD due to TBI may be accompanied by disturbances in emotional function\n(e.g., irritability, easy frustration, tension and anxiety, affective lability); personality\nchanges (e.g., disinhibition, apathy, suspiciousness, aggression); physical disturbances\n(e.g., headache, fatigue, sleep disorders, vertigo or dizziness, tinnitus or hyperacusis, pho-\ntosensitivity, anosmia, reduced tolerance to psychotropic medications); and, particularly\nin more severe TBI, neurological symptoms and signs (e.g., seizures, hemiparesis, visual\ndisturbances, cranial nerve deficits) and evidence of orthopedic injuries.Intermediate-duration NCD induced by drugs with central nervous system depressant effects\nmay manifest with added symptoms of increased irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and\ndysphoria. Intermediate-duration NCD induced by stimulant drugs may manifest with re-\nbound depression, hypersomnia, and apathy. In severe forms of substance/medication-\ninduced major NCD (e.g., associated with long-term alcohol use), there may be prominent\nneuromotor features, such as incoordination, ataxia, and motor slowing. There may also be\nloss of emotional control, including aggressive or inappropriate affect, or apathy.Major or mild NCD due to HIV infection is usually more prevalent in individuals with\nprior episodes of severe immunosuppression, high viral loads in the cerebrospinal fluid,\nand indicators of advanced HIV disease such as anemia and hypoalbuminemia. Individ-\nuals with advanced NCD may experience prominent neuromotor features such as severe\nincoordination, ataxia, and motor slowing. There may be loss of emotional control, includ-\ning aggressive or inappropriate affect or apathy.", "prevalence": "The prevalence of NCD varies widely by age and by etiological subtype. Overall preva-\nlence estimates are generally only available for older populations. Among individuals\nolder than 60 years, prevalence increases steeply with age, so prevalence estimates are\nmore accurate for narrow age bands than for broad categories such as “over 65” (where the\nmean age can vary greatly with the life expectancy of the given population). For those eti-\nological subtypes occurring across the lifespan, prevalence estimates for NCD are likely to\nbe available, if at all, only as the fraction of individuals who develop NCD among those\nwith the relevant condition (e.g., traumatic brain injury, HIV infection).\nOverall prevalence estimates for dementia (which is largely congruent with major\nNCD) are approximately 1%–2% at age 65 years and as high as 30% by age 85 years. Thecommunity settings, where evaluations are less detailed. In addition, in contrast with clin-\nical settings, where cognitive concern must be high to seek and locate care, there may be a\nless clear decline from baseline functioning. Estimates of the prevalence of mild cognitive\nimpairment (which is substantially congruent with mild NCD) among older individuals\nare fairly variable, ranging from 2% to 10% at age 65 and 5% to 25% by age 85.The prevalence of overall dementia (major NCD) rises steeply with age. In high-income\ncountries, it ranges from 5% to 10% in the seventh decade to at least 25% thereafter. U.S.\ncensus data estimates suggest that approximately 7% of individuals diagnosed with Alz-\nheimer’s disease are between ages 65 and 74 years, 53% are between ages 75 and 84 years,\nand 40% are 85 years and older. The percentage of dementias attributable to Alzheimer’s\ndisease ranges from about 60% to over 90%, depending on the setting and diagnostic cri-\nteria. Mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease is likely to represent a substantial fraction of\nmild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well.Major or mild frontotemporal NCD is a common cause of early-onset NCD in individuals\nyounger than 65 years. Population prevalence estimates are in the range of 2–10 per\n100,000. Approximately 20%–25% of cases of frontotemporal NCD occur in individuals\nolder than 65 years. Frontotemporal NCD accounts for about 5% of all cases of dementia in\nunselected autopsy series. Prevalence estimates of behavioral variant and semantic lan-\nguage variant are higher among males, and prevalence estimates of nonfluent language\nvariant are higher among females.The few population-based prevalence estimates for NCDLB available range from 0.1% to\n5% of the general elderly population, and from 1.7% to 30.5% of all dementia cases. In\nbrain bank (autopsy) series, the pathological lesions known as Lewy bodies are present in\n20%–35% of cases of dementia. The male-to-female ratio is approximately 1.5:1.Major or mild vascular NCD is the second most common cause of NCD after Alzheimer’s\ndisease. In the United States, population prevalence estimates for vascular dementia range\nfrom 0.2% in the 65–70 years age group to 16% in individuals 80 years and older. Within\n3 months following stroke, 20%–30% of individuals are diagnosed with dementia. In neu-\nropathology series, the prevalence of vascular dementia increases from 13% at age 70 years\nto 44.6% at age 90 years or older, in comparison with Alzheimer’s disease (23.6%–51%) and\ncombined vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (2%–46.4%). Higher prevalence has\nMajor or Mild Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder\n623\nbeen reported in African Americans compared with Caucasians, and in East Asian countries\n(e.g., Japan, China). Prevalence is higher in males than in females.In the United States, 1.7 million TBIs occur annually, resulting in 1.4 million emergency de-\npartment visits, 275,000 hospitalizations, and 52,000 deaths. About 2% of the population\nlives with TBI-associated disability. Males account for 59% of TBIs in the United States.\nThe most common etiologies of TBI in the United States are falls, vehicular accidents, and\nbeing struck on the head. Collisions and blows to the head that occur in the course of con-\ntact sports are increasingly recognized as sources of mild TBI, with a concern that repeated\nmild TBI may have cumulatively persisting sequelae.The prevalence of these conditions is not known. Prevalence figures for substance abuse are\navailable, and substance/medication-induced major or mild NCDs are more likely in those\nwho are older, have longer use, and have other risk factors such as nutritional deficits.\nFor alcohol abuse, the rate of mild NCD of intermediate duration is approximately 30%–\n40% in the first 2 months of abstinence. Mild NCD may persist, particularly in those who do\nnot achieve stable abstinence until after age 50 years. Major NCD is rare and may result from\nconcomitant nutritional deficits, as in alcohol-induced amnestic confabulatory NCD.\nFor individuals quitting cocaine, methamphetamine, opioids, phencyclidine, and sed-\native, hypnotics, or anxiolytics, substance/medication-induced mild NCD of intermediate\nduration may occur in one-third or more, and there is some evidence that these substances\nmay also be associated with persistent mild NCD. Major NCD associated with these sub-\nstances is rare, if it occurs at all. In the case of methamphetamine, cerebrovascular disease\ncan also occur, resulting in diffuse or focal brain injury that can be of mild or major neu-\nrocognitive levels. Solvent exposure has been linked to both major and mild NCD of both\nintermediate and persistent duration.\nThe presence of NCD induced by cannabis and various hallucinogens is controversial.\nWith cannabis, intoxication is accompanied by various neurocognitive disturbances, but\nthese tend to clear with abstinence.\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder\n631Depending on stage of HIV disease, approximately one-third to over one-half of HIV-\ninfected individuals have at least mild neurocognitive disturbance, but some of these dis-\nturbances may not meet the full criteria for mild NCD. An estimated 25% of individuals\nwith HIV will have signs and symptoms that meet criteria for mild NCD, and in fewer than\n5% would criteria for major NCD be met.The annual incidence of sporadic CJD is approximately one or two cases per million peo-\nple. Prevalence is unknown but very low given the short survival.", "development_course": "The course of NCD varies across etiological subtypes, and this variation can be useful inMajor or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease progresses gradually, sometimes with\nbrief plateaus, through severe dementia to death. The mean duration of survival after di-\nMajor or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer’s Disease\n613\nagnosis is approximately 10 years, reflecting the advanced age of the majority of individ-\nuals rather than the course of the disease; some individuals can live with the disease for as\nlong as 20 years. Late-stage individuals are eventually mute and bedbound. Death most\ncommonly results from aspiration in those who survive through the full course. In mild\nNCD due to Alzheimer’s disease, impairments increase over time, and functional status\ngradually declines until symptoms reach the threshold for the diagnosis of major NCD.\nThe onset of symptoms is usually in the eighth and ninth decades; early-onset forms\nseen in the fifth and sixth decades are often related to known causative mutations. Symp-\ntoms and pathology do not differ markedly at different onset ages. However, younger in-\ndividuals are more likely to survive the full course of the disease, while older individuals\nare more likely to have numerous medical comorbidities that affect the course and man-\nagement of the illness. Diagnostic complexity is higher in older adults because of the in-\ncreased likelihood of comorbid medical illness and mixed pathology.Individuals with major or mild frontotemporal NCD commonly present in the sixth de-\ncade of life, although the age at onset varies from the third to the ninth decades. The dis-\nease is gradually progressive, with median survival being 6–11 years after symptom onset\nand 3–4 years after diagnosis. Survival is shorter and decline is faster in major or mild fron-\ntotemporal NCD than in typical Alzheimer’s disease.NCDLB is a gradually progressive disorder with insidious onset. However, there is often\na prodromal history of confusional episodes (delirium) of acute onset, often precipitated\nby illness or surgery. The distinction between NCDLB, in which Lewy bodies are primar-\nily cortical in location, and major or mild NCD due to Parkinson’s disease, in which the pa-\nthology is primarily in the basal ganglia, is the order in which the cognitive and motor\nsymptoms emerge. In NCDLB, the cognitive decline is manifested early in the course of ill-\nness, at least a year before the onset of motor symptoms (see the section “Differential Di-\n620\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nagnosis” for this disorder). Disease course may be characterized by occasional plateaus\nbut eventually progresses through severe dementia to death. Average duration of survival\nis 5–7 years in clinical series. Onset of symptoms is typically observed from the sixth\nthrough the ninth decades of life, with most cases having their onset when affected indi-\nviduals are in their mid-70s.Major or mild vascular NCD can occur at any age, although the prevalence increases ex-\nponentially after age 65 years. In older individuals, additional pathologies may partly ac-\ncount for the neurocognitive deficits. The course may vary from acute onset with partial\nimprovement to stepwise decline to progressive decline, with fluctuations and plateaus of\nvarying durations. Pure subcortical major or mild vascular NCD can have a slowly pro-\ngressive course that simulates major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease.The severity of a TBI is rated at the time of injury/initial assessment as mild, moderate, or\nsevere according to the thresholds in Table 2.\nThe severity rating of the TBI itself does not necessarily correspond to the severity of\nthe resulting NCD. The course of recovery from TBI is variable, depending not only on the\nspecifics of the injury but also on cofactors, such as age, prior history of brain damage, or\nsubstance abuse, that may favor or impede recovery.\n626\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nNeurobehavioral symptoms tend to be most severe in the immediate aftermath of the\nTBI. Except in the case of severe TBI, the typical course is that of complete or substantial\nimprovement in associated neurocognitive, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms and\nsigns. Neurocognitive symptoms associated with mild TBI tend to resolve within days to\nweeks after the injury with complete resolution typical by 3 months. Other symptoms that\nmay potentially co-occur with the neurological symptoms (e.g., depression, irritability,\nfatigue, headache, photosensitivity, sleep disturbance) also tend to resolve in the weeks\nfollowing mild TBI. Substantial subsequent deterioration in these areas should trigger con-\nsideration of additional diagnoses. However, repeated mild TBI may be associated with\npersisting neurocognitive disturbance.\nWith moderate and severe TBI, in addition to persistence of neurocognitive deficits,\nthere may be associated neurophysiological, emotional, and behavioral complications.\nThese include seizures (particularly in the first year), photosensitivity, hyperacusis, irritabil-\nity, aggression, depression, sleep disturbance, fatigue, apathy, inability to resume occu-\npational and social functioning at pre-injury level, and deterioration in interpersonal\nrelationships. Moderate and severe TBI have been associated with increased risk of depres-\nsion, aggression, and possibly neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.\nThe features of persisting major or mild NCD due to TBI will vary by age, specifics of\nthe injury, and cofactors. Persisting TBI-related impairment in an infant or child may be re-\nflected in delays in reaching developmental milestones (e.g., language acquisition), worse\nacademic performance, and possibly impaired social development. Among older teenag-\ners and adults, persisting symptoms may include various neurocognitive deficits, irrita-\nbility, hypersensitivity to light and sound, easy fatigability, and mood changes, including\ndepression, anxiety, hostility, or apathy. In older individuals with depleted cognitive re-\nserve, mild TBI is more likely to result in incomplete recoveries.Substance use disorders tend to commence during adolescence and peak in the 20s and\n30s. Although longer history of severe substance use disorder is associated with greater\nlikelihood of NCD, the relationships are not straightforward, with substantial and even\ncomplete recovery of neurocognitive functions being common among individuals who\nachieve stable abstinence prior to age 50 years. Substance/medication-induced major or\nmild NCD is most likely to become persistent in individuals who continue abuse of sub-\nstances past age 50 years, presumably because of a combination of lessened neural plas-\nticity and beginnings of other age-related brain changes. Earlier commencement of abuse,\nparticularly of alcohol, may lead to defects in later neural development (e.g., later stages of\nmaturation of frontal circuitries), which may have effects on social cognition as well as\nother neurocognitive abilities. For alcohol-induced NCD, there may be an additive effect\nof aging and alcohol-induced brain injury.An NCD due to HIV infection can resolve, improve, slowly worsen, or have a fluctuating\ncourse. Rapid progression to profound neurocognitive impairment is uncommon in the\ncontext of currently available combination antiviral treatment; consequently, an abrupt\nchange in mental status in an individual with HIV may prompt an evaluation of other\nmedical sources for the cognitive change, including secondary infections. Because HIV in-\nfection preferentially affects subcortical regions over the course of illness, including deep\nwhite matter, the progression of the disorder follows a “subcortical” pattern. Since HIV\ncan affect a variety of brain regions, and the illness can take on many different trajectories\ndepending on associated comorbidities and consequences of HIV, the overall course of an\nNCD due to HIV infection has considerable heterogeneity. A subcortical neurocognitive\nprofile may interact with age over the life course, when psychomotor slowing and motor\nimpairments such as slowed gait may occur as a consequence of other age-related condi-\ntions so that the overall progression may appear more pronounced in later life.\nIn developed countries, HIV disease is primarily a condition of adults, with acquisition\nvia risky behaviors (e.g., unprotected sex, injection drug use) beginning in late adolescence\nand peaking during young and middle adulthood. In developing countries, particularly\nsub-Saharan Africa, where HIV testing and antiretroviral treatments for pregnant women\nare not readily available, perinatal transmission is common. The NCD in such infants and\nchildren may present primarily as neurodevelopmental delay. As individuals treated for\nHIV survive into older age, additive and interactive neurocognitive effects of HIV and\naging, including other NCDs (e.g., due to Alzheimer’s disease, due to Parkinson’s dis-\nease), are possible.Prion disease may develop at any age in adults—the peak age for the sporadic CJD is ap-\nproximately 67 years—although it has been reported to occur in individuals spanning the\nteenage years to late life. Prodromal symptoms of prion disease may include fatigue, anx-\niety, problems with appetite or sleeping, or difficulties with concentration. After several\nweeks, these symptoms may be followed by incoordination, altered vision, or abnormal\ngait or other movements that may be myoclonic, choreoathetoid, or ballistic, along with a\nrapidly progressive dementia. The disease typically progresses very rapidly to the major\nlevel of impairment over several months. More rarely, it can progress over 2 years and ap-\npear similar in its course to other NCDs.\n636\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nRisk Factors and Prognosis\nEnvironmental.\nCross-species transmission of prion infections, with agents that are\nclosely related to the human form, has been demonstrated (e.g., the outbreak of bovine\nspongiform encephalopathy inducing variant CJD in the United Kingdom during the mid-\n1990s). Transmission by corneal transplantation and by human growth factor injection has\nbeen documented, and anecdotal cases of transmission to health care workers have been\nreported.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThere is a genetic component in up to 15% of cases, associ-\nated with an autosomal dominant mutation.", "risk_factors": "Risk factors vary not only by etiological subtype but also by age at onset within etiologicalEnvironmental.\nTraumatic brain injury increases risk for major or mild NCD due to Alz-\nheimer’s disease.\nGenetic and physiological.\nAge is the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. The\ngenetic susceptibility polymorphism apolipoprotein E4 increases risk and decreases age\nat onset, particularly in homozygous individuals. There are also extremely rare causative\nAlzheimer’s disease genes. Individuals with Down’s syndrome (trisomy 21) develop Alz-\nheimer’s disease if they survive to midlife. Multiple vascular risk factors influence risk for\nAlzheimer’s disease and may act by increasing cerebrovascular pathology or also through\ndirect effects on Alzheimer pathology.Genetic and physiological.\nApproximately 40% of individuals with major or mild fron-\ntotemporal NCD have a family history of early-onset NCD, and approximately 10% show an\nautosomal dominant inheritance pattern. A number of genetic factors have been identified,\nsuch as mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT), the\ngranulin gene (GRN), and the C9ORF72 gene. A number of families with causative muta-\ntions have been identified (see the section “Diagnostic Markers” for this disorder), but many\nindividuals with known familial transmission do not have a known mutation. The presence\nof motor neuron disease is associated with a more rapid deterioration.Genetic and physiological.\nFamilial aggregation may occur, and several risk genes have\nbeen identified, but in most cases of NCDLB, there is no family history.Environmental.\nThe neurocognitive outcomes of vascular brain injury are influenced by\nneuroplasticity factors such as education, physical exercise, and mental activity.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThe major risk factors for major or mild vascular NCD are the\nsame as those for cerebrovascular disease, including hypertension, diabetes, smoking, obesity,\nhigh cholesterol levels, high homocysteine levels, other risk factors for atherosclerosis and ar-\nteriolosclerosis, atrial fibrillation, and other conditions increasing the risk of cerebral emboli.\nCerebral amyloid angiopathy is an important risk factor in which amyloid deposits occur\nwithin arterial vessels. Another key risk factor is the hereditary condition cerebral autosomal\ndominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, or CADASIL.Risk factors for traumatic brain injury.\nTraumatic brain injury rates vary by age, with\nthe highest prevalence among individuals younger than 4 years, older adolescents, and in-\ndividuals older than 65 years. Falls are the most common cause of TBI, with motor vehicle\naccidents being second.

In addition, for alcohol-induced NCD, long-term nutri-\ntional deficiencies, liver disease, vascular risk factors, and cardiovascular and cerebrovas-\ncular disease may contribute to risk.Risk factors for HIV infection include injec-\ntion drug use, unprotected sex, and unprotected blood supply and other iatrogenic factors.fection.\nParadoxically, NCD due to HIV infection has not declined significantly with the\nadvent of combined antiretroviral therapy, although the most severe presentations (con-\nsistent with the diagnosis of major NCD) have decreased sharply. Contributory factors\nmay include inadequate control of HIV in the central nervous system (CNS), the evolution\nof drug-resistant viral strains, the effects of chronic long-term systemic and brain inflam-\nmation, and the effects of comorbid factors such as aging, drug abuse, past history of CNS\ntrauma, and co-infections, such as with the hepatitis C virus. Chronic exposure to antiret-\nroviral drugs also raises the possibility of neurotoxicity, although this has not been defin-\nitively established.\n634\nNeurocognitive Disorders", "cultural_issues": "Individuals’ and families’ level of awareness and concern about neurocognitive symp-\ntoms may vary across ethnic and occupational groups. Neurocognitive symptoms are\nmore likely to be noticed, particularly at the mild level, in individuals who engage in com-\nplex occupational, domestic, or recreational activities. In addition, norms for neuropsy-\nchological testing tend to be available only for broad populations, and thus they may not\nbe easily applicable to individuals with less than high school education or those being\nevaluated outside their primary language or culture.Detection of an NCD may be more difficult in cultural and socioeconomic settings where\nmemory loss is considered normal in old age, where older adults face fewer cognitive de-\nmands in everyday life, or where very low educational levels pose greater challenges to\nobjective cognitive assessment.", "gender_issues": "Like age, culture, and occupation, gender issues may affect the level of concern and aware-\nness of cognitive symptoms. In addition, for late-life NCDs, females are likely to be older,\nto have more medical comorbidity, and to live alone, which can complicate evaluation and\ntreatment. In addition, there are gender differences in the frequency of some of the etio-\nlogical subtypes.", "diagnostic_markers": "In addition to a careful history, neuropsychological assessments are the key measures for\ndiagnosis of NCDs, particularly at the mild level, where functional changes are minimal\n610\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nand symptoms more subtle. Ideally, individuals will be referred for formal neuropsycho-\nlogical testing, which will provide a quantitative assessment of all relevant domains and\nthus help with diagnosis; provide guidance to the family on areas where the individual\nmay require more support; and serve as a benchmark for further decline or response to\ntherapies. When such testing is unavailable or not feasible, the brief assessments in Table 1\ncan provide insight into each domain. More global brief mental status tests may be helpful\nbut may be insensitive, particularly to modest changes in a single domain or in those with\nhigh premorbid abilities, and may be overly sensitive in those with low premorbid abilities.\nIn distinguishing among etiological subtypes, additional diagnostic markers may\ncome into play, particularly neuroimaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging\nscans and positron emission tomography scans. In addition, specific markers may be in-\nvolved in the assessment of specific subtypes and may become more important as addi-\ntional research findings accumulate over time, as discussed in the relevant sections.Cortical atrophy, amyloid-predominant neuritic plaques, and tau-predominant neurofibril-\nlary tangles are hallmarks of the pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and may be\nconfirmed via postmortem histopathological examination. For early-onset cases with auto-\nsomal dominant inheritance, a mutation in one of the known causative Alzheimer’s disease\ngenes—amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), or presenilin 2 (PSEN2)—\nmay be involved, and genetic testing for such mutations is commercially available, at least\nfor PSEN1. Apolipoprotein E4 cannot serve as a diagnostic marker because it is only a risk\nfactor and neither necessary nor sufficient for disease occurrence.\nSince amyloid beta-42 deposition in the brain occurs early in the pathophysiological\ncascade, amyloid-based diagnostic tests such as amyloid imaging on brain positron emis-\nsion tomography (PET) scans and reduced levels of amyloid beta-42 in the cerebrospinal\nfluid (CSF) may have diagnostic value. Signs of neuronal injury, such as hippocampal and\ntemporoparietal cortical atrophy on a magnetic resonance image scan, temporoparietal\nhypometabolism on a fluorodeoxyglucose PET scan, and evidence for elevated total tau\nand phospho-tau levels in CSF, provide evidence of neuronal damage but are less specific\nfor Alzheimer’s disease. At present, these biomarkers are not fully validated, and many\nare available only in tertiary care settings. However, some of them, along with novel bio-\nmarkers, will likely move into wider clinical practice in the coming years.\n614\nNeurocognitive DisordersComputed tomography (CT) or structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may show\ndistinct patterns of atrophy. In behavioral-variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD,\nboth frontal lobes (especially the medial frontal lobes) and the anterior temporal lobes are\natrophic. In semantic language–variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD, the middle,\ninferior, and anterior temporal lobes are atrophic bilaterally but asymmetrically, with the\nMajor or Mild Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder\n617\nleft side usually being more affected. Nonfluent language–variant major or mild fronto-\ntemporal NCD is associated with predominantly left posterior frontal-insular atrophy.\nThe logopenic variant of major or mild frontotemporal NCD is associated with predomi-\nnantly left posterior perisylvian or parietal atrophy. Functional imaging demonstrates hy-\npoperfusion and/or cortical hypometabolism in the corresponding brain regions, which\nmay be present in the early stages in the absence of structural abnormality. Emerging bio-\nmarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta and tau levels, and\namyloid imaging) may help in the differential diagnosis, but the distinction from Alzhei-\nmer’s disease can remain difficult (the logopenic variant is in fact often a manifestation of\nAlzheimer’s disease).\nIn familial cases of frontotemporal NCD, the identification of genetic mutations may\nhelp confirm the diagnosis. Mutations associated with frontotemporal NCD include\nthe genes encoding microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) and granulin (GRN),\nC9ORF72, transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43, or TARDBP),\nvalosin-containing protein (VCP), chromatin modifying protein 2B (CHMP2B), and fused\nin sarcoma protein (FUS).The underlying neurodegenerative disease is primarily a synucleinopathy due to alpha-\nsynuclein misfolding and aggregation. Cognitive testing beyond the use of a brief screen-\ning instrument may be necessary to define deficits clearly. Assessment scales developed to\nmeasure fluctuation can be useful. The associated condition REM sleep behavior disorder\nmay be diagnosed through a formal sleep study or identified by questioning the patient or\ninformant about relevant symptoms. Neuroleptic sensitivity (challenge) is not recom-\nmended as a diagnostic marker but raises suspicion of NCDLB if it occurs. A diagnosti-\ncally suggestive feature is low striatal dopamine transporter uptake on single photon\nemission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) scan.\nOther clinically useful markers potentially include relative preservation of medial tempo-\nral structures on computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain\nscan; reduced striatal dopamine transporter uptake on SPECT/PET scan; generalized low\nuptake on SPECT/PET perfusion scan with reduced occipital activity; abnormal (low up-\ntake) MIBG myocardial scintigraphy suggesting sympathetic denervation; and prominent\nslow-wave activity on the electroencephalogram with temporal lobe transient waves.Structural neuroimaging, using MRI or CT, has an important role in the diagnostic pro-\ncess. There are no other established biomarkers of major or mild vascular NCD.Beyond neuropsychological testing, CT scanning may reveal petechial hemorrhages,\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage, or evidence of contusion. Magnetic resonance image scanning\nmay also reveal hyperintensities suggestive of microhemorrhages.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of individuals with chronic alcohol abuse frequently\nreveals cortical thinning, white matter loss, and enlargement of sulci and ventricles. While\nneuroimaging abnormalities are more common in those with NCDs, it is possible to ob-\nserve NCDs without neuroimaging abnormalities, and vice versa. Specialized techniques\n(e.g., diffusion tensor imaging) may reveal damage to specific white matter tracts. Mag-\nnetic resonance spectroscopy may reveal reduction in N-acetylaspartate, and increase in\nmarkers of inflammation (e.g., myoinositol) or white matter injury (e.g., choline). Many of\nthese brain imaging changes and neurocognitive manifestations reverse following suc-\ncessful abstinence. In individuals with methamphetamine use disorder, MRI may also re-\nveal hyperintensities suggestive of microhemorrhages or larger areas of infarction.Serum HIV testing is required for the diagnosis. In addition, HIV characterization of the cere-\nbrospinal fluid may be helpful if it reveals a disproportionately high viral load in cerebrospinal\nfluid versus in the plasma. Neuroimaging (i.e., magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) may reveal\nreduction in total brain volume, cortical thinning, reduction in white matter volume, and\npatchy areas of abnormal white matter (hyperintensities). MRI or lumbar puncture may be\nhelpful to exclude a specific medical condition such as cryptococcus infection or herpes en-\ncephalitis that may contribute to CNS changes in the context of AIDS. Specialized techniques\nsuch as diffusion tensor imaging may reveal damage to specific white matter tracts.Prion disease can be definitively confirmed only by biopsy or at autopsy. Although there are\nno distinctive findings on cerebrospinal fluid analysis across the prion diseases, reliable bio-\nmarkers are being developed and include 14-3-3 protein (particularly for sporadic CJD) as\nwell as tau protein. Magnetic resonance brain imaging is currently considered the most sen-\nsitive diagnostic test when DWI is performed, with the most common finding being multi-\nfocal gray matter hyperintensities in subcortical and cortical regions. In some individuals,\nthe electroencephalogram reveals periodic sharp, often triphasic and synchronous dis-\ncharges at a rate of 0.5–2 Hz at some point during the course of the disorder.", "suicide_risk": "", "functional_consequences": "Major and Mild Neurocognitive Disorders\nBy definition, major and mild NCDs affect functioning, given the central role of cognition in\nhuman life. Thus, the criteria for the disorders, and the threshold for differentiating mild\nfrom major NCD, are based in part on functional assessment. Within major NCD there is a\nbroad range of functional impairment, as implemented in the severity specifiers. In addition,\nthe specific functions that are compromised can help identify the cognitive domains affected,\nparticularly when neuropsychological testing is not available or is difficult to interpret.Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer’s Disease\nThe prominence of memory loss can cause significant difficulties relatively early in the\ncourse. Social cognition (and thus social functioning) and procedural memory (e.g., danc-\ning, playing musical instruments) may be relatively preserved for extended periods.Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder\nBecause of the relative early age at onset of the disorder, the disorder oftens affects work-\nplace and family life. Because of the involvement of language and/or behavior, function is\noften more severely impaired relatively early in the course. For individuals with the be-\nhavioral variant, prior to diagnostic clarification there may be significant family disrup-\ntion, legal involvement, and problems in the workplace because of socially inappropriate\nbehaviors. The functional impairment due to behavioral change and language dysfunc-\ntion, which can include hyperorality, impulsive wandering, and other dishinhibited be-\nhaviors, may far exceed that due to the cognitive disturbance and may lead to nursing\nhome placement or institutionalization. These behaviors can be severely disruptive, even\nin structured care settings, particularly when the individuals are otherwise healthy, non-\nfrail, and free of other medical comorbidities.Neurocognitive Disorder With Lewy Bodies\nIndividuals with NCDLB are more functionally impaired than would be expected for their\ncognitive deficits when contrasted to individuals with other neurodegenerative diseases,\nsuch as Alzheimer’s disease. This is largely a result of motor and autonomic impairments,\nwhich cause problems with toileting, transferring, and eating. Sleep disorders and prom-\ninent psychiatric symptoms may also add to functional difficulties. Consequently, the qual-\nity of life of individuals with NCDLB is often significantly worse than that of individuals\nwith Alzheimer’s disease.Major or Mild Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder\nMajor or mild vascular NCD is commonly associated with physical deficits that cause ad-\nditional disability.Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury\nWith mild NCD due to TBI, individuals may report reduced cognitive efficiency, difficulty\nconcentrating, and lessened ability to perform usual activities. With major NCD due to TBI, an\nindividual may have difficulty in independent living and self-care. Prominent neuromotor\nfeatures, such as severe incoordination, ataxia, and motor slowing, may be present in major\nNCD due to TBI and may add to functional difficulties. Individuals with TBI histories report\nmore depressive symptoms, and these can amplify cognitive complaints and worsen func-\ntional outcome. Additionally, loss of emotional control, including aggressive or inappropriate\naffect and apathy, may be present after more severe TBI with greater neurocognitive impair-\nment. These features may compound difficulties with independent living and self-care.Induced Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder\nThe functional consequences of substance/medication-induced mild NCD are sometimes\naugmented by reduced cognitive efficiency and difficulty concentrating beyond that seen\nin many other NCDs. In addition, at both major and mild levels, substance/medication-\ninduced NCDs may have associated motor syndromes that increase the level of functional\nimpairment.Neurocognitive Disorder Due to HIV Infectionindividuals. Thus, impaired executive abilities and slowed information processing may\nsubstantially interfere with the complex disease management decisions required for ad-\nherence to the combined antiretroviral therapy regimen. The likelihood of comorbid dis-\nease may further create functional challenges.", "differential_diagnosis": "stroke) typically begin at a specific time and (at least after initial symptoms related to in-\nflammation or swelling subside) remain static. Others may fluctuate over time (although\nif this occurs, the possibility of delirium superimposed on NCD should be considered).\nNCDs due to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease or frontotemporal\nlobar degeneration typically are marked by insidious onset and gradual progression, and\nMajor and Mild Neurocognitive Disorders\n609\nthe pattern of onset of cognitive deficits and associated features helps to distinguish among\nthem.\nNCDs with onset in childhood and adolescence may have broad repercussions for so-\ncial and intellectual development, and in this setting intellectual disability (intellectual\ndevelopmental disorder) and/or other neurodevelopmental disorders may also be diag-\nnosed to capture the full diagnostic picture and ensure the provision of a broad range of\nservices. In older individuals, NCDs often occur in the setting of medical illnesses, frailty,\nand sensory loss, which complicate the clinical picture for diagnosis and treatment.\nWhen cognitive loss occurs in youth to midlife, individuals and families are likely to\nseek care. NCDs are typically easiest to identify at younger ages, although in some settings\nmalingering or other factitious disorders may be a concern. Very late in life, cognitive\nsymptoms may not cause concern or may go unnoticed. In late life, mild NCD must also be\ndistinguished from the more modest deficits associated with “normal aging,” although a\nsubstantial fraction of what has been ascribed to normal aging likely represents prodromal\nphases of various NCDs. In addition, it becomes harder to recognize mild NCD with age\nbecause of the increasing prevalence of medical illness and sensory deficits. It becomes\nharder to differentiate among subtypes with age because there are multiple potential sources\nof neurocognitive decline.Normal cognition.\nThe differential diagnosis between normal cognition and mild NCD,\nas between mild and major NCD, is challenging because the boundaries are inherently ar-\nbitrary. Careful history taking and objective assessment are critical to these distinctions. A\nlongitudinal evaluation using quantified assessments may be key in detecting mild NCD.\nDelirium.\nBoth mild and major NCD may be difficult to distinguish from a persistent de-\nlirium, which can co-occur. Careful assessment of attention and arousal will help to make\nthe distinction.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nThe distinction between mild NCD and major depressive\ndisorder, which may co-occur with NCD, can also be challenging. Specific patterns of cog-\nnitive deficits may be helpful. For example, consistent memory and executive function\ndeficits are typical of Alzheimer’s disease, whereas nonspecific or more variable perfor-\nmance is seen in major depression. Alternatively, treatment of the depressive disorder\nwith repeated observation over time may be required to make the diagnosis.\nSpecific learning disorder and other neurodevelopmental disorders.\nA careful clari-\nfication of the individual’s baseline status will help distinguish an NCD from a specific\nlearning disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders. Additional issues may enter the\ndifferential for specific etiological subtypes, as described in the relevant sections.Other neurocognitive disorders.\nMajor and mild NCDs due to other neurodegenera-\ntive processes (e.g., Lewy body disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration) share the in-\nsidious onset and gradual decline caused by Alzheimer’s disease but have distinctive core\nfeatures of their own. In major or mild vascular NCD, there is typically history of stroke\ntemporally related to the onset of cognitive impairment, and infarcts or white matter hy-\nperintensities are judged sufficient to account for the clinical picture. However, particu-\nlarly when there is no clear history of stepwise decline, major or mild vascular NCD can\nshare many clinical features with Alzheimer’s disease.\nOther concurrent, active neurological or systemic illness.\nOther neurological or sys-\ntemic illness should be considered if there is an appropriate temporal relationship and\nseverity to account for the clinical picture. At the mild NCD level, it may be difficult to dis-\ntinguish an Alzheimer’s disease etiology from that of another medical condition (e.g., thy-\nroid disorders, vitamin B12 deficiency).\nMajor depressive disorder.\nParticularly at the mild NCD level, the differential diagnosis\nalso includes major depression. The presence of depression may be associated with re-\nduced daily functioning and poor concentration that may resemble an NCD, but improve-\nment with treatment of depression may be useful in making the distinction.Other neurocognitive disorders.\nOther neurodegenerative diseases may be distinguished\nfrom major or mild frontotemporal NCD by their characteristic features. In major or mild\nNCD due to Alzheimer’s disease, decline in learning and memory is an early feature.\nHowever, 10%–30% of patients presenting with a syndrome suggestive of major or mild\nfrontotemporal NCD are found at autopsy to have Alzheimer’s disease pathology. This oc-\ncurs more frequently in individuals who present with progressive dysexecutive syn-\ndromes in the absence of behavioral changes or movement disorder or in those with the\nlogopenic variant.\nIn major or mild NCD with Lewy bodies, core and suggestive features of Lewy bodies\nmust be present. In major or mild NCD due to Parkinson’s disease, spontaneous parkin-\nsonism emerges well before the cognitive decline. In major or mild vascular NCD, depend-\ning on affected brain regions, there may also be loss of executive ability and behavioral\nchanges such as apathy, and this disorder should be considered in the differential diagno-\nsis. However, history of a cerebrovascular event is temporally related to the onset of cog-\nnitive impairment in major or mild vascular NCD, and neuroimaging reveals infarctions\nor white matter lesions sufficient to account for the clinical picture.\nOther neurological conditions.\nMajor or mild frontotemporal NCD overlaps with pro-\ngressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and motor neuron disease\nclinically as well as pathologically. Progressive supranuclear palsy is characterized by\n618\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nsupranuclear gaze palsies and axial-predominant parkinsonism. Pseudobulbar signs may\nbe present, and retropulsion is often prominent. Neurocognitive assessment shows psy-\nchomotor slowing, poor working memory, and executive dysfunction. Corticobasal degen-\neration presents with asymmetric rigidity, limb apraxia, postural instability, myoclonus,\nalien limb phenomenon, and cortical sensory loss. Many individuals with behavioral-variant\nmajor or mild frontotemporal NCD show features of motor neuron disease, which tend to\nbe mixed upper and predominantly lower motor neuron disease.\nOther mental disorders and medical conditions.\nBehavioral-variant major or mild fron-\ntotemporal NCD may be mistaken for a primary mental disorder, such as major depression,\nbipolar disorders, or schizophrenia, and individuals with this variant often present initially\nto psychiatry. Over time, the development of progressive neurocognitive difficulties will\nhelp to make the distinction. A careful medical evaluation will help to exclude treatable\ncauses of NCDs, such as metabolic disturbances, nutritional deficiencies, and infections.\nMajor or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder\nWith Lewy BodiesMajor or mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson’s disease.\nA key differenti-\nating feature in clinical diagnosis is the temporal sequence in which the parkinsonism and\nthe NCD appear. For NCD due to Parkinson’s disease, the individual must develop cog-\nnitive decline in the context of established Parkinson’s disease; by convention, the decline\nshould not reach the stage of major NCD until at least 1 year after Parkinson’s is diagnosed.\nIf less than a year has passed since the onset of motor symptoms, the diagnosis is NCDLB.\nThis distinction is clearer at the major NCD level than at the mild NCD level.\nThe timing and sequence of parkinsonism and mild NCD may be more difficult to de-\ntermine because the onset and clinical presentation can be ambiguous, and unspecified\nmild NCD should be diagnosed if the other core and suggestive features are absent.\nMajor or Mild Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder\n621Other neurocognitive disorders.\nSince incidental brain infarctions and white matter le-\nsions are common in older individuals, it is important to consider other possible etiologies\nwhen an NCD is present. A history of memory deficit early in the course, and progressive\nworsening of memory, language, executive function, and perceptual-motor abilities in the\nabsence of corresponding focal lesions on brain imaging, are suggestive of Alzheimer’s\ndisease as the primary diagnosis. Potential biomarkers currently being validated for Alz-\nheimer’s disease, such as cerebrospinal fluid levels of beta-amyloid and phosphorylated\ntau, and amyloid imaging, may prove to be helpful in the differential diagnosis. NCD with\nLewy bodies is distinguished from major or mild vascular NCD by its core features of fluc-\ntuating cognition, visual hallucinations, and spontaneous parkinsonism. While deficits in\nexecutive function and language occur in major or mild vascular NCD, the insidious onset\nand gradual progression of behavioral features or language impairment are characteristic\nof frontotemporal NCD and are not typical of vascular etiology.\nOther medical conditions.\nA diagnosis of major or mild vascular NCD is not made if\nother diseases (e.g., brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, encephalitis, toxic or metabolic disor-\nders) are present and are of sufficient severity to account for the cognitive impairment.\n624\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nOther mental disorders.\nA diagnosis of major or mild vascular NCD is inappropriate if\nthe symptoms can be entirely attributed to delirium, although delirium may sometimes be\nsuperimposed on a preexisting major or mild vascular NCD, in which case both diagnoses\ncan be made. If the criteria for major depressive disorder are met and the cognitive impair-\nment is temporally related to the likely onset of the depression, major or mild vascular\nNCD should not be diagnosed. However, if the NCD preceded the development of the de-\npression, or the severity of the cognitive impairment is out of proportion to the severity of\nthe depression, both should be diagnosed.In some instances, severity of neurocognitive symptoms may appear to be inconsistent\nwith the severity of the TBI. After previously undetected neurological complications (e.g.,\nchronic hematoma) are excluded, the possibility of diagnoses such as somatic symptom\ndisorder or factitious disorder need to be considered. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\ncan co-occur with the NCD and have overlapping symptoms (e.g., difficulty concentrat-\ning, depressed mood, aggressive behavioral disinhibition).Individuals with substance use disorders, substance intoxication, and substance withdrawal\nare at increased risk for other conditions that may independently, or through a compounding\neffect, result in neurocognitive disturbance. These include history of traumatic brain injury\nand infections that can accompany substance use disorder (e.g., HIV, hepatitis C virus, syph-\nilis). Therefore, presence of substance/medication-induced major or mild NCD should be\ndifferentiated from NCDs arising outside the context of substance use, intoxication, and with-\ndrawal, including these accompanying conditions (e.g., traumatic brain injury).\n632\nNeurocognitive DisordersIn the presence of comorbidities, such as other infections (e.g., hepatitis C virus, syphilis),\ndrug abuse (e.g., methamphetamine abuse), or prior head injury or neurodevelopmental\nconditions, major or mild NCD due to HIV infection can be diagnosed provided there is ev-\nidence that infection with HIV has worsened any NCDs due to such preexisting or comorbid\nconditions. Among older adults, onset of neurocognitive decline related to cerebrovascular\ndisease or neurodegeneration (e.g., major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease) may\nneed to be differentiated. In general, stable, fluctuating (without progression) or improving\nneurocognitive status would favor an HIV etiology, whereas steady or stepwise deter-\nioration would suggest neurodegenerative or vascular etiology. Because more severe im-\nmunodeficiency can result in opportunistic infections of the brain (e.g., toxoplasmosis;\ncryptococcosis) and neoplasia (e.g., CNS lymphoma), sudden onset of an NCD or sudden\nworsening of that disorder demands active investigation of non-HIV etiologies.Other major neurocognitive disorders.\nMajor NCD due to prion disease may appear\nsimilar in its course to other NCDs, but prion diseases are typically distinguished by their\nrapid progression and prominent cerebellar and motor symptoms.", "comorbidity": "NCDs are common in older individuals and thus often co-occur with a wide variety of age-\nrelated diseases that may complicate diagnosis or treatment. Most notable of these is\ndelirium, for which NCD increases the risk. In older individuals, a delirium during hos-\npitalization is, in many cases, the first time that an NCD is noticed, although a careful his-\ntory will often reveal evidence of earlier decline. Mixed NCDs are also common in older\nindividuals, as many etiological entities increase in prevalence with age. In younger indi-\nviduals, NCD often co-occurs with neurodevelopmental disorders; for example, a head in-\nMajor or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer’s Disease\n611\njury in a preschool child may also lead to significant developmental and learning issues.\nAdditional comorbidity of NCD is often related to the etiological subtype, as discussed in\nthe relevant sections.\nMajor or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder\nDue to Alzheimer’s DiseaseMost individuals with Alzheimer’s disease are elderly and have multiple medical conditions\nthat can complicate diagnosis and influence the clinical course. Major or mild NCD due to\nAlzheimer’s disease commonly co-occurs with cerebrovascular disease, which contributes\nto the clinical picture. When a comorbid condition contributes to the NCD in an individual\nwith Alzheimer’s disease, then NCD due to multiple etiologies should be diagnosed.\nMajor or Mild Frontotemporal\nNeurocognitive DisorderLewy body pathology frequently coexists with Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular\ndisease pathology, particularly among the oldest age groups. In Alzheimer’s disease, there\nis concomitant synuclein pathology in 60% of cases (if amygdala-restricted cases are in-\ncluded). In general, there is a higher rate of Lewy body pathology in individuals with de-\nmentia than in older individuals without dementia.\nMajor or Mild Vascular Neurocognitive DisorderMajor or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease commonly co-occurs with major or mild\nvascular NCD, in which case both diagnoses should be made. Major or mild vascular NCD\nand depression frequently co-occur.\nMajor or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder\nDue to Traumatic Brain InjuryAmong individuals with substance use disorders, the neurocognitive effects of the sub-\nstance contribute to or compound the TBI-associated neurocognitive change. Some symp-\ntoms associated with TBI may overlap with symptoms found in cases of PTSD, and the two\ndisorders may co-occur, especially in military populations.\nSubstance/Medication-Induced\nMajor or Mild Neurocognitive DisorderSubstance use disorders, substance intoxication, and substance withdrawal are highly co-\nmorbid with other mental disorders. Comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder, psychotic\ndisorders, depressive and bipolar disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders can con-\ntribute to neurocognitive impairment in substance users. Traumatic brain injury occurs\nmore frequently with substance use, complicating efforts to determine the etiology of NCD\nin such cases. Severe, long-term alcohol use disorder can be associated with major organ\nsystem disease, including cerebrovascular disease and cirrhosis. Amphetamine-induced\nNCD may be accompanied by major or mild vascular NCD, also secondary to amphet-\namine use.\nMajor or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder\nDue to HIV InfectionHIV disease is accompanied by chronic systemic and neuro-inflammation that can be as-\nsociated with cerebrovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. These complications can\nbe part of the pathogenesis of major or mild NCD due to HIV infection.

In adulthood, competitive\nemployment is often seen in jobs that do not empha-\nsize conceptual skills. Individuals generally need\nsupport to make health care decisions and legal\ndecisions, and to learn to perform a skilled vocation\ncompetently.

Onset is during the developmental period (Criterion C). The diagnosis\nof intellectual disability is based on both clinical assessment and standardized testing of\nintellectual and adaptive functions.\nCriterion A refers to intellectual functions that involve reasoning, problem solving,\nplanning, abstract thinking, judgment, learning from instruction and experience, and\npractical understanding. Critical components include verbal comprehension, working\nmemory, perceptual reasoning, quantitative reasoning, abstract thought, and cognitive ef-\nficacy. Intellectual functioning is typically measured with individually administered and\npsychometrically valid, comprehensive, culturally appropriate, psychometrically sound\ntests of intelligence. Individuals with intellectual disability have scores of approximately\ntwo standard deviations or more below the population mean, including a margin for mea-\nsurement error (generally +5 points). On tests with a standard deviation of 15 and a mean\nof 100, this involves a score of 65–75 (70 ± 5). Clinical training and judgment are required\nto interpret test results and assess intellectual performance.\nFactors that may affect test scores include practice effects and the “Flynn effect’ (i.e.,\noverly high scores due to out-of-date test norms). Invalid scores may result from the use of\nbrief intelligence screening tests or group tests; highly discrepant individual subtest scores\nmay make an overall IQ score invalid. Instruments must be normed for the individual’s so-\nciocultural background and native language. Co-occurring disorders that affect communi-\ncation, language, and/or motor or sensory function may affect test scores. Individual\ncognitive profiles based on neuropsychological testing are more useful for understanding\nintellectual abilities than a single IQ score. Such testing may identify areas of relative\nstrengths and weaknesses, an assessment important for academic and vocational planning.\nIQ test scores are approximations of conceptual functioning but may be insufficient to\nassess reasoning in real-life situations and mastery of practical tasks. For example, a per-\nson with an IQ score above 70 may have such severe adaptive behavior problems in social\njudgment, social understanding, and other areas of adaptive functioning that the person’s\nactual functioning is comparable to that of individuals with a lower IQ score. Thus, clinical\njudgment is needed in interpreting the results of IQ tests.\nDeficits in adaptive functioning (Criterion B) refer to how well a person meets community\nstandards of personal independence and social responsibility, in comparison to others of sim-\nilar age and sociocultural background. Adaptive functioning involves adaptive reasoning in\nthree domains: conceptual, social, and practical. The conceptual (academic) domain involves\ncompetence in memory, language, reading, writing, math reasoning, acquisition of practical\nknowledge, problem solving, and judgment in novel situations, among others. The social do-\nmain involves awareness of others’ thoughts, feelings, and experiences; empathy; interper-\nsonal communication skills; friendship abilities; and social judgment, among others. The\npractical domain involves learning and self-management across life settings, including personal\ncare, job responsibilities, money management, recreation, self-management of behavior, and\nschool and work task organization, among others. Intellectual capacity, education, motivation,\nsocialization, personality features, vocational opportunity, cultural experience, and coexisting\ngeneral medical conditions or mental disorders influence adaptive functioning.\nAdaptive functioning is assessed using both clinical evaluation and individualized,\nculturally appropriate, psychometrically sound measures. Standardized measures are\nused with knowledgeable informants (e.g., parent or other family member; teacher; coun-\nselor; care provider) and the individual to the extent possible. Additional sources of infor-\nmation include educational, developmental, medical, and mental health evaluations.\nScores from standardized measures and interview sources must be interpreted using clin-\nical judgment. When standardized testing is difficult or impossible, because of a variety of\n38\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nfactors (e.g., sensory impairment, severe problem behavior), the individual may be diag-\nnosed with unspecified intellectual disability. Adaptive functioning may be difficult to\nassess in a controlled setting (e.g., prisons, detention centers); if possible, corroborative in-\nformation reflecting functioning outside those settings should be obtained.\nCriterion B is met when at least one domain of adaptive functioning—conceptual, so-\ncial, or practical—is sufficiently impaired that ongoing support is needed in order for the\nperson to perform adequately in one or more life settings at school, at work, at home, or in\nthe community. To meet diagnostic criteria for intellectual disability, the deficits in adap-\ntive functioning must be directly related to the intellectual impairments described in Cri-\nterion A. Criterion C, onset during the developmental period, refers to recognition that\nintellectual and adaptive deficits are present during childhood or adolescence.", "associated_features": "Intellectual disability is a heterogeneous condition with multiple causes. There may be\nassociated difficulties with social judgment; assessment of risk; self-management of behav-\nior, emotions, or interpersonal relationships; or motivation in school or work environments.\nLack of communication skills may predispose to disruptive and aggressive behaviors. Gull-\nibility is often a feature, involving naiveté in social situations and a tendency for being easily\nled by others. Gullibility and lack of awareness of risk may result in exploitation by others\nand possible victimization, fraud, unintentional criminal involvement, false confessions,\nand risk for physical and sexual abuse. These associated features can be important in crim-\ninal cases, including Atkins-type hearings involving the death penalty.\nIndividuals with a diagnosis of intellectual disability with co-occurring mental disor-\nders are at risk for suicide. They think about suicide, make suicide attempts, and may die\nfrom them. Thus, screening for suicidal thoughts is essential in the assessment process. Be-\ncause of a lack of awareness of risk and danger, accidental injury rates may be increased.", "prevalence": "Intellectual disability has an overall general population prevalence of approximately 1%,\nand prevalence rates vary by age. Prevalence for severe intellectual disability is approxi-\nmately 6 per 1,000.", "development_course": "Onset of intellectual disability is in the developmental period. The age and characteristic\nfeatures at onset depend on the etiology and severity of brain dysfunction. Delayed motor,\nlanguage, and social milestones may be identifiable within the first 2 years of life among\nthose with more severe intellectual disability, while mild levels may not be identifiable un-\ntil school age when difficulty with academic learning becomes apparent. All criteria (in-\ncluding Criterion C) must be fulfilled by history or current presentation. Some children\nunder age 5 years whose presentation will eventually meet criteria for intellectual disabil-\nity have deficits that meet criteria for global developmental delay.\nWhen intellectual disability is associated with a genetic syndrome, there may be a char-\nacteristic physical appearance (as in, e.g., Down syndrome). Some syndromes have a\nbehavioral phenotype, which refers to specific behaviors that are characteristic of particular\ngenetic disorder (e.g., Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). In acquired forms, the onset may be\nabrupt following an illness such as meningitis or encephalitis or head trauma occurring\nduring the developmental period. When intellectual disability results from a loss of pre-\nviously acquired cognitive skills, as in severe traumatic brain injury, the diagnoses of in-\ntellectual disability and of a neurocognitive disorder may both be assigned.\nAlthough intellectual disability is generally nonprogressive, in certain genetic disor-\nders (e.g., Rett syndrome) there are periods of worsening, followed by stabilization, and in\nIntellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder)\n39\nothers (e.g., San Phillippo syndrome) progressive worsening of intellectual function. After\nearly childhood, the disorder is generally lifelong, although severity levels may change\nover time. The course may be influenced by underlying medical or genetic conditions and\nco-occurring conditions (e.g., hearing or visual impairments, epilepsy). Early and ongoing in-\nterventions may improve adaptive functioning throughout childhood and adulthood. In\nsome cases, these result in significant improvement of intellectual functioning, such that\nthe diagnosis of intellectual disability is no longer appropriate. Thus, it is common practice\nwhen assessing infants and young children to delay diagnosis of intellectual disability un-\ntil after an appropriate course of intervention is provided. For older children and adults,\nthe extent of support provided may allow for full participation in all activities of daily liv-\ning and improved adaptive function. Diagnostic assessments must determine whether im-\nproved adaptive skills are the result of a stable, generalized new skill acquisition (in which\ncase the diagnosis of intellectual disability may no longer be appropriate) or whether the\nimprovement is contingent on the presence of supports and ongoing interventions (in\nwhich case the diagnosis of intellectual disability may still be appropriate).", "risk_factors": "Genetic and physiological.\nPrenatal etiologies include genetic syndromes (e.g., se-\nquence variations or copy number variants involving one or more genes; chromosomal\ndisorders), inborn errors of metabolism, brain malformations, maternal disease (including\nplacental disease), and environmental influences (e.g., alcohol, other drugs, toxins, terato-\ngens). Perinatal causes include a variety of labor and delivery-related events leading to\nneonatal encephalopathy. Postnatal causes include hypoxic ischemic injury, traumatic\nbrain injury, infections, demyelinating disorders, seizure disorders (e.g., infantile spasms),\nsevere and chronic social deprivation, and toxic metabolic syndromes and intoxications\n(e.g., lead, mercury).", "cultural_issues": "Intellectual disability occurs in all races and cultures. Cultural sensitivity and knowledge\nare needed during assessment, and the individual’s ethnic, cultural, and linguistic back-\nground, available experiences, and adaptive functioning within his or her community and\ncultural setting must be taken into account.", "gender_issues": "Overall, males are more likely than females to be diagnosed with both mild (average\nmale:female ratio 1.6:1) and severe (average male:female ratio 1.2:1) forms of intellectual\ndisability. However, gender ratios vary widely in reported studies. Sex-linked genetic fac-\ntors and male vulnerability to brain insult may account for some of the gender differences.", "diagnostic_markers": "A comprehensive evaluation includes an assessment of intellectual capacity and adaptive\nfunctioning; identification of genetic and nongenetic etiologies; evaluation for associated\nmedical conditions (e.g., cerebral palsy, seizure disorder); and evaluation for co-occurring\nmental, emotional, and behavioral disorders. Components of the evaluation may include\nbasic pre- and perinatal medical history, three-generational family pedigree, physical exam-\nination, genetic evaluation (e.g., karyotype or chromosomal microarray analysis and testing\nfor specific genetic syndromes), and metabolic screening and neuroimaging assessment.", "suicide_risk": "", "functional_consequences": "", "differential_diagnosis": "The diagnosis of intellectual disability should be made whenever Criteria A, B, and C are\nmet. A diagnosis of intellectual disability should not be assumed because of a particular\n40\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\ngenetic or medical condition. A genetic syndrome linked to intellectual disability should\nbe noted as a concurrent diagnosis with the intellectual disability.\nMajor and mild neurocognitive disorders.\nIntellectual disability is categorized as a neu-\nrodevelopmental disorder and is distinct from the neurocognitive disorders, which are\ncharacterized by a loss of cognitive functioning. Major neurocognitive disorder may co-\noccur with intellectual disability (e.g., an individual with Down syndrome who develops\nAlzheimer’s disease, or an individual with intellectual disability who loses further cogni-\ntive capacity following a head injury). In such cases, the diagnoses of intellectual disability\nand neurocognitive disorder may both be given.\nCommunication disorders and specific learning disorder.\nThese neurodevelopmental\ndisorders are specific to the communication and learning domains and do not show defi-\ncits in intellectual and adaptive behavior. They may co-occur with intellectual disability.\nBoth diagnoses are made if full criteria are met for intellectual disability and a communi-\ncation disorder or specific learning disorder.\nAutism spectrum disorder.\nIntellectual disability is common among individuals with\nautism spectrum disorder. Assessment of intellectual ability may be complicated by so-\ncial-communication and behavior deficits inherent to autism spectrum disorder, which\nmay interfere with understanding and complying with test procedures. Appropriate as-\nsessment of intellectual functioning in autism spectrum disorder is essential, with reas-\nsessment across the developmental period, because IQ scores in autism spectrum disorder\nmay be unstable, particularly in early childhood.", "comorbidity": "Co-occurring mental, neurodevelopmental, medical, and physical conditions are frequent\nin intellectual disability, with rates of some conditions (e.g., mental disorders, cerebral\npalsy, and epilepsy) three to four times higher than in the general population. The prognosis\nand outcome of co-occurring diagnoses may be influenced by the presence of intellectual\ndisability. Assessment procedures may require modifications because of associated disor-\nders, including communication disorders, autism spectrum disorder, and motor, sensory,\nor other disorders. Knowledgeable informants are essential for identifying symptoms\nsuch as irritability, mood dysregulation, aggression, eating problems, and sleep problems,\nand for assessing adaptive functioning in various community settings.\nThe most common co-occurring mental and neurodevelopmental disorders are atten-\ntion-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; depressive and bipolar disorders; anxiety disorders;\nautism spectrum disorder; stereotypic movement disorder (with or without self-injurious\nbehavior); impulse-control disorders; and major neurocognitive disorder. Major depres-\nsive disorder may occur throughout the range of severity of intellectual disability. Self-\ninjurious behavior requires prompt diagnostic attention and may warrant a separate di-\nagnosis of stereotypic movement disorder. Individuals with intellectual disability, partic-\nularly those with more severe intellectual disability, may also exhibit aggression and\ndisruptive behaviors, including harm of others or property destruction.\nRelationship to Other Classifications\nICD-11 (in development at the time of this publication) uses the term intellectual develop-\nmental disorders to indicate that these are disorders that involve impaired brain functioning\nearly in life. These disorders are described in ICD-11 as a metasyndrome occurring in the\ndevelopmental period analogous to dementia or neurocognitive disorder in later life.\nThere are four subtypes in ICD-11: mild, moderate, severe, and profound.\nThe American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD)\nalso uses the term intellectual disability with a similar meaning to the term as used in this\nGlobal Developmental Delay\n41\nmanual. The AAIDD’s classification is multidimensional rather than categorical and is\nbased on the disability construct.

The language deficits are evident in spoken communication,\nwritten communication, or sign language. Language learning and use is dependent on\nboth receptive and expressive skills. Expressive ability refers to the production of vocal, ges-\ntural, or verbal signals, while receptive ability refers to the process of receiving and com-\nprehending language messages. Language skills need to be assessed in both expressive\nand receptive modalities as these may differ in severity. For example, an individual’s ex-\npressive language may be severely impaired, while his receptive language is hardly im-\npaired at all.\nLanguage disorder usually affects vocabulary and grammar, and these effects then\nlimit the capacity for discourse. The child’s first words and phrases are likely to be delayed\nin onset; vocabulary size is smaller and less varied than expected; and sentences are\nshorter and less complex with grammatical errors, especially in past tense. Deficits in com-\nprehension of language are frequently underestimated, as children may be good at using\ncontext to infer meaning. There may be word-finding problems, impoverished verbal def-\ninitions, or poor understanding of synonyms, multiple meanings, or word play appro-\npriate for age and culture. Problems with remembering new words and sentences are\nmanifested by difficulties following instructions of increasing length, difficulties rehears-\ning strings of verbal information (e.g., remembering a phone number or a shopping list),\nand difficulties remembering novel sound sequences, a skill that may be important for\nlearning new words.

The biological origin includes an interaction of genetic, epigenetic, and en-\nvironmental factors, which affect the brain’s ability to perceive or process verbal or non-\nverbal information efficiently and accurately.\nOne essential feature of specific learning disorder is persistent difficulties learning key-\nstone academic skills (Criterion A), with onset during the years of formal schooling (i.e., the de-\nvelopmental period). Key academic skills include reading of single words accurately and\nfluently, reading comprehension, written expression and spelling, arithmetic calculation, and\nmathematical reasoning (solving mathematical problems). In contrast to talking or walking,\nwhich are acquired developmental milestones that emerge with brain maturation, academic\nskills (e.g., reading, spelling, writing, mathematics) have to be taught and learned explicitly.\nSpecific learning disorder disrupts the normal pattern of learning academic skills; it is not sim-\nply a consequence of lack of opportunity of learning or inadequate instruction. Difficulties\nmastering these key academic skills may also impede learning in other academic subjects (e.g.,\nhistory, science, social studies), but those problems are attributable to difficulties learning the\nunderlying academic skills. Difficulties learning to map letters with the sounds of one’s lan-\nguage—to read printed words (often called dyslexia)—is one of the most common manifesta-\ntions of specific learning disorder. The learning difficulties manifest as a range of observable,\ndescriptive behaviors or symptoms (as listed in Criteria A1–A6). These clinical symptoms may\nbe observed, probed by means of the clinical interview, or ascertained from school reports, rat-\ning scales, or descriptions in previous educational or psychological assessments. The learning\ndifficulties are persistent, not transitory. In children and adolescents, persistence is defined as\nrestricted progress in learning (i.e., no evidence that the individual is catching up with class-\nmates) for at least 6 months despite the provision of extra help at home or school. For example,\ndifficulties learning to read single words that do not fully or rapidly remit with the provision of\ninstruction in phonological skills or word identification strategies may indicate a specific\nSpecific Learning Disorder\n69\nlearning disorder. Evidence of persistent learning difficulties may be derived from cumulative\nschool reports, portfolios of the child’s evaluated work, curriculum-based measures, or clinical\ninterview. In adults, persistent difficulty refers to ongoing difficulties in literacy or numeracy\nskills that manifest during childhood or adolescence, as indicated by cumulative evidence\nfrom school reports, evaluated portfolios of work, or previous assessments.\nA second key feature is that the individual’s performance of the affected academic skills is\nwell below average for age (Criterion B). One robust clinical indicator of difficulties learning\nacademic skills is low academic achievement for age or average achievement that is sustain-\nable only by extraordinarily high levels of effort or support. In children, the low academic skills\ncause significant interference in school performance (as indicated by school reports and\nteacher’s grades or ratings). Another clinical indicator, particularly in adults, is avoidance of\nactivities that require the academic skills. Also in adulthood, low academic skills interfere with\noccupational performance or everyday activities requiring those skills (as indicated by self-re-\nport or report by others). However, this criterion also requires psychometric evidence from an\nindividually administered, psychometrically sound and culturally appropriate test of aca-\ndemic achievement that is norm-referenced or criterion-referenced. Academic skills are dis-\ntributed along a continuum, so there is no natural cutpoint that can be used to differentiate\nindividuals with and without specific learning disorder. Thus, any threshold used to specify\nwhat constitutes significantly low academic achievement (e.g., academic skills well below age\nexpectation) is to a large extent arbitrary. Low achievement scores on one or more standard-\nized tests or subtests within an academic domain (i.e., at least 1.5 standard deviations [SD] be-\nlow the population mean for age, which translates to a standard score of 78 or less, which is\nbelow the 7th percentile) are needed for the greatest diagnostic certainty. However, precise\nscores will vary according to the particular standardized tests that are used. On the basis of\nclinical judgment, a more lenient threshold may be used (e.g., 1.0–2.5 SD below the pop-\nulation mean for age), when learning difficulties are supported by converging evidence\nfrom clinical assessment, academic history, school reports, or test scores. Moreover, since\nstandardized tests are not available in all languages, the diagnosis may then be based in\npart on clinical judgment of scores on available test measures.\nA third core feature is that the learning difficulties are readily apparent in the early\nschool years in most individuals (Criterion C). However, in others, the learning difficulties\nmay not manifest fully until later school years, by which time learning demands have in-\ncreased and exceed the individual’s limited capacities.\nAnother key diagnostic feature is that the learning difficulties are considered “spe-\ncific,” for four reasons. First, they are not attributable to intellectual disabilities (intellec-\ntual disability [intellectual developmental disorder]); global developmental delay;\nhearing or vision disorders, or neurological or motor disorders) (Criterion D). Specific\nlearning disorder affects learning in individuals who otherwise demonstrate normal lev-\nels of intellectual functioning (generally estimated by an IQ score of greater than about 70\n[±5 points allowing for measurement error]). The phrase “unexpected academic under-\nachievement” is often cited as the defining characteristic of specific learning disorder in\nthat the specific learning disabilities are not part of a more general learning difficulty as\nmanifested in intellectual disability or global developmental delay. Specific learning dis-\norder may also occur in individuals identified as intellectually “gifted.” These individuals\nmay be able to sustain apparently adequate academic functioning by using compensatory\nstrategies, extraordinarily high effort, or support, until the learning demands or assess-\nment procedures (e.g., timed tests) pose barriers to their demonstrating their learning or\naccomplishing required tasks. Second, the learning difficulty cannot be attributed to more\ngeneral external factors, such as economic or environmental disadvantage, chronic absen-\nteeism, or lack of education as typically provided in the individual’s community context.\nThird, the learning difficulty cannot be attributed to a neurological (e.g., pediatric stroke)\nor motor disorders or to vision or hearing disorders, which are often associated with prob-\nlems learning academic skills but are distinguishable by presence of neurological signs.\n70\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nFinally, the learning difficulty may be restricted to one academic skill or domain (e.g., read-\ning single words, retrieving or calculating number facts).\nComprehensive assessment is required. Specific learning disorder can only be diagnosed\nafter formal education starts but can be diagnosed at any point afterward in children, adoles-\ncents, or adults, providing there is evidence of onset during the years of formal schooling (i.e.,\nthe developmental period). No single data source is sufficient for a diagnosis of specific learn-\ning disorder. Rather, specific learning disorder is a clinical diagnosis based on a synthesis of\nthe individual’s medical, developmental, educational, and family history; the history of the\nlearning difficulty, including its previous and current manifestation; the impact of the diffi-\nculty on academic, occupational, or social functioning; previous or current school reports;\nportfolios of work requiring academic skills; curriculum-based assessments; and previous or\ncurrent scores from individual standardized tests of academic achievement. If an intellectual,\nsensory, neurological, or motor disorder is suspected, then the clinical assessment for specific\nlearning disorder should also include methods appropriate for these disorders. Thus, compre-\nhensive assessment will involve professionals with expertise in specific learning disorder and\npsychological/cognitive assessment. Since specific learning disorder typically persists into\nadulthood, reassessment is rarely necessary, unless indicated by marked changes in the learn-\ning difficulties (amelioration or worsening) or requested for specific purposes.", "associated_features": "Specific learning disorder is frequently but not invariably preceded, in preschool years, by\ndelays in attention, language, or motor skills that may persist and co-occur with specific\nlearning disorder. An uneven profile of abilities is common, such as above-average abili-\nties in drawing, design, and other visuospatial abilities, but slow, effortful, and inaccurate\nreading and poor reading comprehension and written expression. Individuals with spe-\ncific learning disorder typically (but not invariably) exhibit poor performance on psycho-\nlogical tests of cognitive processing. However, it remains unclear whether these cognitive\nabnormalities are the cause, correlate, or consequence of the learning difficulties. Also, al-\nthough cognitive deficits associated with difficulties learning to read words are well doc-\numented, those associated with other manifestations of specific learning disorder (e.g.,\nreading comprehension, arithmetic computation, written expression) are underspecified\nor unknown. Moreover, individuals with similar behavioral symptoms or test scores are\nfound to have a variety of cognitive deficits, and many of these processing deficits are also\nfound in other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disor-\nder [ADHD], autistic spectrum disorder, communication disorders, developmental coor-\ndination disorder). Thus, assessment of cognitive processing deficits is not required for\ndiagnostic assessment. Specific learning disorder is associated with increased risk for sui-\ncidal ideation and suicide attempts in children, adolescents, and adults.\nThere are no known biological markers of specific learning disorder. As a group, indi-\nviduals with the disorder show circumscribed alterations in cognitive processing and\nbrain structure and function. Genetic differences are also evident at the group level. But\ncognitive testing, neuroimaging, or genetic testing are not useful for diagnosis at this time.", "prevalence": "The prevalence of specific learning disorder across the academic domains of reading, writ-\ning, and mathematics is 5%–15% among school-age children across different languages\nand cultures. Prevalence in adults is unknown but appears to be approximately 4%.", "development_course": "Onset, recognition, and diagnosis of specific learning disorder usually occurs during the\nelementary school years when children are required to learn to read, spell, write, and learn\nSpecific Learning Disorder\n71\nmathematics. However, precursors such as language delays or deficits, difficulties in\nrhyming or counting, or difficulties with fine motor skills required for writing commonly\noccur in early childhood before the start of formal schooling. Manifestations may be be-\nhavioral (e.g., a reluctance to engage in learning; oppositional behavior). Specific learning\ndisorder is lifelong, but the course and clinical expression are variable, in part depending\non the interactions among the task demands of the environment, the range and severity of\nthe individual’s learning difficulties, the individual’s learning abilities, comorbidity, and\nthe available support systems and intervention. Nonetheless, problems with reading flu-\nency and comprehension, spelling, written expression, and numeracy skills in everyday life\ntypically persist into adulthood.\nChanges in manifestation of symptoms occur with age, so that an individual may have\na persistent or shifting array of learning difficulties across the lifespan.\nExamples of symptoms that may be observed among preschool-age children include a lack\nof interest in playing games with language sounds (e.g., repetition, rhyming), and they may\nhave trouble learning nursery rhymes. Preschool children with specific learning disorder may\nfrequently use baby talk, mispronounce words, and have trouble remembering names of let-\nters, numbers, or days of the week. They may fail to recognize letters in their own names and\nhave trouble learning to count. Kindergarten-age children with specific learning disorder may\nbe unable to recognize and write letters, may be unable to write their own names, or may use\ninvented spelling. They may have trouble breaking down spoken words into syllables (e.g.,\n“cowboy” into “cow” and “boy”) and trouble recognizing words that rhyme (e.g., cat, bat, hat).\nKindergarten-age children also may have trouble connecting letters with their sounds (e.g., let-\nter b makes the sound /b/) and may be unable to recognize phonemes (e.g., do not know\nwhich in a set of words [e.g., dog, man, car] starts with the same sound as “cat”).\nSpecific learning disorder in elementary school–age children typically manifests as\nmarked difficulty learning letter-sound correspondence (particularly in English-speaking\nchildren), fluent word decoding, spelling, or math facts; reading aloud is slow, inaccurate,\nand effortful, and some children struggle to understand the magnitude that a spoken or\nwritten number represents. Children in primary grades (grades 1–3) may continue to have\nproblems recognizing and manipulating phonemes, be unable to read common one-sylla-\nble words (such as mat or top), and be unable recognize common irregularly spelled\nwords (e.g., said, two). They may commit reading errors that indicate problems in con-\nnecting sounds and letters (e.g., “big” for “got”) and have difficulty sequencing numbers\nand letters. Children in grades 1-3 also may have difficulty remembering number facts or\narithmetic procedures for adding, subtracting, and so forth, and may complain that read-\ning or arithmetic is hard and avoid doing it. Children with specific learning disorder in the\nmiddle grades (grades 4–6) may mispronounce or skip parts of long, multisyllable words\n(e.g., say “conible” for “convertible,” “aminal” for “animal”) and confuse words that\nsound alike (e.g., “tornado” for “volcano”). They may have trouble remembering dates,\nnames, and telephone numbers and may have trouble completing homework or tests on\ntime. Children in the middle grades also may have poor comprehension with or without\nslow, effortful, and inaccurate reading, and they may have trouble reading small function\nwords (e.g., that, the, an, in). They may have very poor spelling and poor written work.\nThey may get the first part of a word correctly, then guess wildly (e.g., read “clover” as\n“clock”), and may express fear of reading aloud or refuse to read aloud.\nBy contrast, adolescents may have mastered word decoding, but reading remains slow\nand effortful, and they are likely to show marked problems in reading comprehension and\nwritten expression (including poor spelling) and poor mastery of math facts or mathemat-\nical problem solving. During adolescence and into adulthood, individuals with specific\nlearning disorder may continue to make numerous spelling mistakes and read single\nwords and connected text slowly and with much effort, with trouble pronouncing multi-\nsyllable words. They may frequently need to reread material to understand or get the main\npoint and have trouble making inferences from written text. Adolescents and adults may\n72\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\navoid activities that demand reading or arithmetic (reading for pleasure, reading instruc-\ntions). Adults with specific learning disorder have ongoing spelling problems, slow and\neffortful reading, or problems making important inferences from numerical information\nin work-related written documents. They may avoid both leisure and work-related activ-\nities that demand reading or writing or use alternative approaches to access print (e.g.,\ntext-to-speech/speech-to-text software, audiobooks, audiovisual media).\nAn alternative clinical expression is that of circumscribed learning difficulties that per-\nsist across the lifespan, such as an inability to master the basic sense of number (e.g., to\nknow which of a pair of numbers or dots represents the larger magnitude), or lack of pro-\nficiency in word identification or spelling. Avoidance of or reluctance to engage in activi-\nties requiring academic skills is common in children, adolescents, and adults. Episodes of\nsevere anxiety or anxiety disorders, including somatic complaints or panic attacks, are\ncommon across the lifespan and accompany both the circumscribed and the broader ex-\npression of learning difficulties.", "risk_factors": "Environmental.\nPrematurity or very low birth weight increases the risk for specific\nlearning disorder, as does prenatal exposure to nicotine.\nGenetic and physiological.\nSpecific learning disorder appears to aggregate in families,\nparticularly when affecting reading, mathematics, and spelling. The relative risk of spe-\ncific learning disorder in reading or mathematics is substantially higher (e.g., 4–8 times\nand 5–10 times higher, respectively) in first-degree relatives of individuals with these\nlearning difficulties compared with those without them. Family history of reading diffi-\nculties (dyslexia) and parental literacy skills predict literacy problems or specific learning\ndisorder in offspring, indicating the combined role of genetic and environmental factors.\nThere is high heritability for both reading ability and reading disability in alphabetic and\nnonalphabetic languages, including high heritability for most manifestations of learning abil-\nities and disabilities (e.g., heritability estimate values greater than 0.6). Covariation between\nvarious manifestations of learning difficulties is high, suggesting that genes related to one\npresentation are highly correlated with genes related to another manifestation.\nCourse modifiers.\nMarked problems with inattentive behavior in preschool years is pre-\ndictive of later difficulties in reading and mathematics (but not necessarily specific learn-\ning disorder) and nonresponse to effective academic interventions. Delay or disorders in\nspeech or language, or impaired cognitive processing (e.g., phonological awareness,\nworking memory, rapid serial naming) in preschool years, predicts later specific learning\ndisorder in reading and written expression. Comorbidity with ADHD is predictive of\nworse mental health outcome than that associated with specific learning disorder without\nADHD.

For example, the cognitive\nprocessing requirements of reading and of working with numbers vary greatly across or-\nthographies. In the English language, the observable hallmark clinical symptom of diffi-\nculties learning to read is inaccurate and slow reading of single words; in other alphabetic\nlanguages that have more direct mapping between sounds and letters (e.g., Spanish, Ger-\nman) and in non-alphabetic languages (e.g., Chinese, Japanese), the hallmark feature is\nSpecific Learning Disorder\n73\nslow but accurate reading.

Young children may be delayed in achieving motor milestones (i.e., sitting, crawling,\nwalking), although many achieve typical motor milestones. They also may be delayed in de-\nveloping skills such as negotiating stairs, pedaling, buttoning shirts, completing puzzles, and\nusing zippers. Even when the skill is achieved, movement execution may appear awkward,\nslow, or less precise than that of peers. Older children and adults may display slow speed or in-\naccuracy with motor aspects of activities such as assembling puzzles, building models, playing\nball games (especially in teams), handwriting, typing, driving, or carrying out self-care skills.\nDevelopmental coordination disorder is diagnosed only if the impairment in motor\nskills significantly interferes with the performance of, or participation in, daily activities in\nfamily, social, school, or community life (Criterion B).

When autism spectrum disorder is present, stereotypic move-\nment disorder is diagnosed only when there is self-injury or when the stereotypic behav-\niors are sufficiently severe to become a focus of treatment.\nTic disorders.\nTypically, stereotypies have an earlier age at onset (before 3 years) than\ndo tics, which have a mean age at onset of 5–7 years. They are consistent and fixed in their\npattern or topography compared with tics, which are variable in their presentation. Ste-\nreotypies may involve arms, hands, or the entire body, while tics commonly involve eyes,\nface, head, and shoulders. Stereotypies are more fixed, rhythmic, and prolonged in dura-\ntion than tics, which, generally, are brief, rapid, random, and fluctuating. Tics and stereo-\ntypic movements are both reduced by distraction.\nObsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nStereotypic movement disorder is dis-\ntinguished from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) by the absence of obsessions, as\nwell as by the nature of the repetitive behaviors. In OCD the individual feels driven to per-\nform repetitive behaviors in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be ap-\nplied rigidly, whereas in stereotypic movement disorder the behaviors are seemingly\ndriven but apparently purposeless. Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) and excoria-\ntion (skin-picking) disorder are characterized by body-focused repetitive behaviors (i.e.,\nhair pulling and skin picking) that may be seemingly driven but that are not apparently\npurposeless, and that may not be patterned or rhythmical. Furthermore, onset in tricho-\ntillomania and excoriation disorder is not typically in the early developmental period, but\nrather around puberty or later.\nOther neurological and medical conditions.\nThe diagnosis of stereotypic movements\nrequires the exclusion of habits, mannerisms, paroxysmal dyskinesias, and benign he-\nreditary chorea. A neurological history and examination are required to assess features\nsuggestive of other disorders, such as myoclonus, dystonia, tics, and chorea. Involuntary\nmovements associated with a neurological condition may be distinguished by their signs\nand symptoms. For example, repetitive, stereotypic movements in tardive dyskinesia can\nbe distinguished by a history of chronic neuroleptic use and characteristic oral or facial\ndyskinesia or irregular trunk or limb movements. These types of movements do not result\nin self-injury. A diagnosis of stereotypic movement disorder is not appropriate for repet-\nitive skin picking or scratching associated with amphetamine intoxication or abuse (e.g.,\npatients are diagnosed with substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and re-\nlated disorder) and repetitive choreoathetoid movements associated with other neurolog-\nical disorders.", "comorbidity": "Stereotypic movement disorder may occur as a primary diagnosis or secondary to another\ndisorder.

Diagnosis for any tic disorder is based on the presence of motor and/or vocal\ntics (Criterion A), duration of tic symptoms (Criterion B), age at onset (Criterion C), and ab-\nsence of any known cause such as another medical condition or substance use (Criterion D).\nThe tic disorders are hierarchical in order (i.e., Tourette’s disorder, followed by persistent\n[chronic] motor or vocal tic disorder, followed by provisional tic disorder, followed by the\n82\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nother specified and unspecified tic disorders), such that once a tic disorder at one level of the\nhierarchy is diagnosed, a lower hierarchy diagnosis cannot be made (Criterion E).\nTics are sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movements or vocalizations. An\nindividual may have various tic symptoms over time, but at any point in time, the tic rep-\nertoire recurs in a characteristic fashion. Although tics can include almost any muscle group\nor vocalization, certain tic symptoms, such as eye blinking or throat clearing, are common\nacross patient populations. Tics are generally experienced as involuntary but can be vol-\nuntarily suppressed for varying lengths of time.\nTics can be either simple or complex. Simple motor tics are of short duration (i.e., milli-\nseconds) and can include eye blinking, shoulder shrugging, and extension of the extrem-\nities. Simple vocal tics include throat clearing, sniffing, and grunting often caused by\ncontraction of the diaphragm or muscles of the oropharynx. Complex motor tics are of lon-\nger duration (i.e., seconds) and often include a combination of simple tics such as simul-\ntaneous head turning and shoulder shrugging. Complex tics can appear purposeful, such\nas a tic-like sexual or obscene gesture (copropraxia) or a tic-like imitation of someone else’s\nmovements (echopraxia). Similarly, complex vocal tics include repeating one’s own sounds\nor words (palilalia), repeating the last-heard word or phrase (echolalia), or uttering socially\nunacceptable words, including obscenities, or ethnic, racial, or religious slurs (coprolalia).\nImportantly, coprolalia is an abrupt, sharp bark or grunt utterance and lacks the prosody\nof similar inappropriate speech observed in human interactions.\nThe presence of motor and/or vocal tics varies across the four tic disorders (Criterion\nA). For Tourette’s disorder, both motor and vocal tics must be present, whereas for per-\nsistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder, only motor or only vocal tics are present. For\nprovisional tic disorder, motor and/or vocal tics may be present. For other specified or un-\nspecified tic disorders, the movement disorder symptoms are best characterized as tics but\nare atypical in presentation or age at onset, or have a known etiology.\nThe 1-year minimum duration criterion (Criterion B) assures that individuals diag-\nnosed with either Tourette’s disorder or persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder\nhave had persistent symptoms. Tics wax and wane in severity, and some individuals may\nhave tic-free periods of weeks to months; however, an individual who has had tic symp-\ntoms of greater than 1 year’s duration since first tic onset would be considered to have per-\nsistent symptoms regardless of duration of tic-free periods. For an individual with motor\nand/or vocal tics of less than 1 year since first tic onset, a provisional tic disorder diagnosis\ncan be considered. There is no duration specification for other specified and unspecified tic\ndisorders. The onset of tics must occur prior to age 18 years (Criterion C). Tic disorders\ntypically begin in the prepubertal period, with an average age at onset between 4 and 6\nyears, and with the incidence of new-onset tic disorders decreasing in the teen years. New\nonset of tic symptoms in adulthood is exceedingly rare and is often associated with expo-\nsures to drugs (e.g., excessive cocaine use) or is a result of a central nervous system insult\n(e.g., postviral encephalitis). Although tic onset is uncommon in teenagers and adults, it is\nnot uncommon for adolescents and adults to present for an initial diagnostic assessment\nand, when carefully evaluated, provide a history of milder symptoms dating back to child-\nhood. New-onset abnormal movements suggestive of tics outside of the usual age range\nshould result in evaluation for other movement disorders or for specific etiologies.\nTic symptoms cannot be attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or an-\nother medical condition (Criterion D). When there is strong evidence from the history,\nphysical examination, and/or laboratory results to suggest a plausible, proximal, and\nprobable cause for a tic disorder, a diagnosis of other specified tic disorder should be used.\nHaving previously met diagnostic criteria for Tourette’s disorder negates a possible di-\nagnosis of persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder (Criterion E).

Tics wax and\nwane in severity and change in affected muscle groups and vocalizations over time.

The presence of a co-occurring condition,\nsuch as ADHD or OCD, can have greater impact on functioning. Less commonly, tics dis-\nrupt functioning in daily activities and result in social isolation, interpersonal conflict,\npeer victimization, inability to work or to go to school, and lower quality of life.

Examples include repetitive hand waving/rotating,\narm flapping, and finger wiggling. Motor stereotypies can be differentiated from tics based\non the former’s earlier age at onset (younger than 3 years), prolonged duration (seconds to\nminutes), constant repetitive fixed form and location, exacerbation when engrossed in ac-\ntivities, lack of a premonitory urge, and cessation with distraction (e.g., name called or\ntouched). Chorea represents rapid, random, continual, abrupt, irregular, unpredictable,\nnonstereotyped actions that are usually bilateral and affect all parts of the body (i.e., face,\ntrunk, and limbs). The timing, direction, and distribution of movements vary from mo-\nment to moment, and movements usually worsen during attempted voluntary action. Dys-\ntonia is the simultaneous sustained contracture of both agonist and antagonist muscles,\nresulting in a distorted posture or movement of parts of the body. Dystonic postures are of-\nten triggered by attempts at voluntary movements and are not seen during sleep.\nSubstance-induced and paroxysmal dyskinesias.\nParoxysmal dyskinesias usually oc-\ncur as dystonic or choreoathetoid movements that are precipitated by voluntary move-\nment or exertion and less commonly arise from normal background activity.\nMyoclonus.\nMyoclonus is characterized by a sudden unidirectional movement that is\noften nonrhythmic. It may be worsened by movement and occur during sleep. Myoclonus\nis differentiated from tics by its rapidity, lack of suppressibility, and absence of a premon-\nitory urge.\nObsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nDifferentiating obsessive-compulsive\nbehaviors from tics may be difficult. Clues favoring an obsessive-compulsive behavior in-\nclude a cognitive-based drive (e.g., fear of contamination) and the need to perform the ac-\ntion in a particular fashion a certain number of times, equally on both sides of the body, or\nuntil a “just right” feeling is achieved.

The obsessive-compulsive symptoms observed in tic disorder tend to be characterized\nby more aggressive symmetry and order symptoms and poorer response to pharmacotherapy\nwith selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Children with ADHD may demonstrate disrup-\ntive behavior, social immaturity, and learning difficulties that may interfere with academic\nprogress and interpersonal relationships and lead to greater impairment than that caused by a\ntic disorder.

Concerns range from\nlooking “unattractive” or “not right” to looking “hideous” or “like a monster.” Preoccu-\npations can focus on one or many body areas, most commonly the skin (e.g., perceived\nacne, scars, lines, wrinkles, paleness), hair (e.g., “thinning” hair or “excessive” body or fa-\ncial hair), or nose (e.g., size or shape). However, any body area can be the focus of concern\n(e.g., eyes, teeth, weight, stomach, breasts, legs, face size or shape, lips, chin, eyebrows,\ngenitals).

However, excori-\nation disorder may be precipitated or exacerbated by an underlying dermatological\ncondition. For example, acne may lead to some scratching and picking, which may also be\nassociated with comorbid excoriation disorder. The differentiation between these two\nclinical situations (acne with some scratching and picking vs. acne with comorbid excori-\nation disorder) requires an assessment of the extent to which the individual’s skin picking\nhas become independent of the underlying dermatological condition.\nSubstance/medication-induced disorders.\nSkin-picking symptoms may also be induced\nby certain substances (e.g., cocaine), in which case excoriation disorder should not be di-\nagnosed.

Further guidance in distinguishing grief from\na major depressive episode is provided in the criteria for major depressive episode.\nAbuse and Neglect\nMaltreatment by a family member (e.g., caregiver, intimate adult partner) or by a nonrel-\native can be the area of current clinical focus, or such maltreatment can be an important\nfactor in the assessment and treatment of patients with mental or other medical disorders.\nBecause of the legal implications of abuse and neglect, care should be used in assessing\nthese conditions and assigning these codes. Having a past history of abuse or neglect can\ninfluence diagnosis and treatment response in a number of mental disorders, and may also\nbe noted along with the diagnosis.\nFor the following categories, in addition to listings of the confirmed or suspected event\nof abuse or neglect, other codes are provided for use if the current clinical encounter is to\nprovide mental health services to either the victim or the perpetrator of the abuse or ne-\nglect.

The presence of antisocial personality disorder.\nMalingering differs from factitious disorder in that the motivation for the symptom\nproduction in malingering is an external incentive, whereas in factitious disorder external\nincentives are absent. Malingering is differentiated from conversion disorder and somatic\nsymptom–related mental disorders by the intentional production of symptoms and by the\nobvious external incentives associated with it. Definite evidence of feigning (such as clear\nevidence that loss of function is present during the examination but not at home) would\nsuggest a diagnosis of factitious disorder if the individual’s apparent aim is to assume the\nsick role, or malingering if it is to obtain an incentive, such as money.\nV40.31 (Z91.83)\nWandering Associated With a Mental Disorder\nThis category is used for individuals with a mental disorder whose desire to walk about\nleads to significant clinical management or safety concerns.

Pedophilic disorder, however,\nnecessarily includes other elements that may change over time with or without treatment:\nsubjective distress (e.g., guilt, shame, intense sexual frustration, or feelings of isolation) or\npsychosocial impairment, or the propensity to act out sexually with children, or both.\nTherefore, the course of pedophilic disorder may fluctuate, increase, or decrease with age.\nAdults with pedophilic disorder may report an awareness of sexual interest in children\nthat preceded engaging in sexual behavior involving children or self-identification as a pedo-\nphile. Advanced age is as likely to similarly diminish the frequency of sexual behavior involv-\ning children as it does other paraphilically motivated and normophilic sexual behavior.", "risk_factors": "Temperamental.\nThere appears to be an interaction between pedophilia and antisocial-\nity, such that males with both traits are more likely to act out sexually with children.

Transvestic disorder is nearly\nexclusively reported in males. Sexual arousal, in its most obvious form of penile erection,\nmay co-occur with cross-dressing in various ways. In younger males, cross-dressing often\nleads to masturbation, following which any female clothing is removed.

This\npattern begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts.\n650\nPersonality Disorders\nIndividuals with this disorder assume that other people will exploit, harm, or deceive\nthem, even if no evidence exists to support this expectation (Criterion A1). They suspect on\nthe basis of little or no evidence that others are plotting against them and may attack them\nsuddenly, at any time and without reason. They often feel that they have been deeply and\nirreversibly injured by another person or persons even when there is no objective evidence\nfor this. They are preoccupied with unjustified doubts about the loyalty or trustworthiness\nof their friends and associates, whose actions are minutely scrutinized for evidence of hos-\ntile intentions (Criterion A2). Any perceived deviation from trustworthiness or loyalty\nserves to support their underlying assumptions. They are so amazed when a friend or as-\nsociate shows loyalty that they cannot trust or believe it. If they get into trouble, they ex-\npect that friends and associates will either attack or ignore them.\nIndividuals with paranoid personality disorder are reluctant to confide in or become\nclose to others because they fear that the information they share will be used against them\n(Criterion A3). They may refuse to answer personal questions, saying that the information\nis “nobody’s business.” They read hidden meanings that are demeaning and threatening\ninto benign remarks or events (Criterion A4). For example, an individual with this disor-\nder may misinterpret an honest mistake by a store clerk as a deliberate attempt to short-\nchange, or view a casual humorous remark by a co-worker as a serious character attack.\nCompliments are often misinterpreted (e.g., a compliment on a new acquisition is mis-\ninterpreted as a criticism for selfishness; a compliment on an accomplishment is misinter-\npreted as an attempt to coerce more and better performance). They may view an offer of\nhelp as a criticism that they are not doing well enough on their own.\nIndividuals with this disorder persistently bear grudges and are unwilling to forgive\nthe insults, injuries, or slights that they think they have received (Criterion A5). Minor\nslights arouse major hostility, and the hostile feelings persist for a long time. Because they\nare constantly vigilant to the harmful intentions of others, they very often feel that their\ncharacter or reputation has been attacked or that they have been slighted in some other\nway. They are quick to counterattack and react with anger to perceived insults (Criterion\nA6). Individuals with this disorder may be pathologically jealous, often suspecting that\ntheir spouse or sexual partner is unfaithful without any adequate justification (Criterion\nA7). They may gather trivial and circumstantial “evidence” to support their jealous beliefs.\nThey want to maintain complete control of intimate relationships to avoid being betrayed\nand may constantly question and challenge the whereabouts, actions, intentions, and fi-\ndelity of their spouse or partner.\nParanoid personality disorder should not be diagnosed if the pattern of behavior oc-\ncurs exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar disorder or depressive dis-\norder with psychotic features, or another psychotic disorder, or if it is attributable to the\nphysiological effects of a neurological (e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy) or another medical\ncondition (Criterion B).", "associated_features": "Individuals with paranoid personality disorder are generally difficult to get along with\nand often have problems with close relationships.

They also need to\nParanoid Personality Disorder\n651\nhave a high degree of control over those around them. They are often rigid, critical of oth-\ners, and unable to collaborate, although they have great difficulty accepting criticism them-\nselves. They may blame others for their own shortcomings.

The tendency of individuals with\nparanoid personality disorder to react to minor stimuli with anger is also seen in borderline\nand histrionic personality disorders. However, these disorders are not necessarily associ-\nated with pervasive suspiciousness.

Although antisocial behavior may be present in\nsome individuals with paranoid personality disorder, it is not usually motivated by a desire\nfor personal gain or to exploit others as in antisocial personality disorder, but rather is more\noften attributable to a desire for revenge.

This pattern begins by early adulthood and is pres-\nent in a variety of contexts.\nIndividuals with histrionic personality disorder are uncomfortable or feel unappreci-\nated when they are not the center of attention (Criterion 1). Often lively and dramatic, they\ntend to draw attention to themselves and may initially charm new acquaintances by their\nenthusiasm, apparent openness, or flirtatiousness. These qualities wear thin, however, as\nthese individuals continually demand to be the center of attention. They commandeer the\nrole of “the life of the party.” If they are not the center of attention, they may do something\ndramatic (e.g., make up stories, create a scene) to draw the focus of attention to themselves.\nThis need is often apparent in their behavior with a clinician (e.g., being flattering, bring-\ning gifts, providing dramatic descriptions of physical and psychological symptoms that\nare replaced by new symptoms each visit).\nThe appearance and behavior of individuals with this disorder are often inappropri-\nately sexually provocative or seductive (Criterion 2). This behavior not only is directed to-\nward persons in whom the individual has a sexual or romantic interest but also occurs in\na wide variety of social, occupational, and professional relationships beyond what is ap-\npropriate for the social context. Emotional expression may be shallow and rapidly shifting\n(Criterion 3). Individuals with this disorder consistently use physical appearance to draw\nattention to themselves (Criterion 4). They are overly concerned with impressing others by\ntheir appearance and expend an excessive amount of time, energy, and money on clothes\nand grooming. They may “fish for compliments” regarding appearance and may be easily\nand excessively upset by a critical comment about how they look or by a photograph that\nthey regard as unflattering.\nThese individuals have a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking\nin detail (Criterion 5). Strong opinions are expressed with dramatic flair, but underlying\nreasons are usually vague and diffuse, without supporting facts and details. For example,\nan individual with histrionic personality disorder may comment that a certain individual\nis a wonderful human being, yet be unable to provide any specific examples of good qual-\nities to support this opinion. Individuals with this disorder are characterized by self-\ndramatization, theatricality, and an exaggerated expression of emotion (Criterion 6). They\nmay embarrass friends and acquaintances by an excessive public display of emotions (e.g.,\nembracing casual acquaintances with excessive ardor, sobbing uncontrollably on minor\n668\nPersonality Disorders\nsentimental occasions, having temper tantrums). However, their emotions often seem to\nbe turned on and off too quickly to be deeply felt, which may lead others to accuse the in-\ndividual of faking these feelings.\nIndividuals with histrionic personality disorder have a high degree of suggestibility (Cri-\nterion 7). Their opinions and feelings are easily influenced by others and by current fads.\nThey may be overly trusting, especially of strong authority figures whom they see as mag-\nically solving their problems. They have a tendency to play hunches and to adopt convic-\ntions quickly. Individuals with this disorder often consider relationships more intimate\nthan they actually are, describing almost every acquaintance as “my dear, dear friend” or\nreferring to physicians met only once or twice under professional circumstances by their\nfirst names (Criterion 8).", "associated_features": "Individuals with histrionic personality disorder may have difficulty achieving emotional in-\ntimacy in romantic or sexual relationships.

Individuals with this disorder often\nhave impaired relationships with same-sex friends because their sexually provocative inter-\npersonal style may seem a threat to their friends’ relationships.

In addition to meeting Criterion A for schizophrenia, there is a major mood episode\n(major depressive or manic) (Criterion A for schizoaffective disorder). Because loss of in-\nterest or pleasure is common in schizophrenia, to meet Criterion A for schizoaffective dis-\norder, the major depressive episode must include pervasive depressed mood (i.e., the\npresence of markedly diminished interest or pleasure is not sufficient). Episodes of de-\npression or mania are present for the majority of the total duration of the illness (i.e., after\nCriterion A has been met) (Criterion C for schizoaffective disorder). To separate schizoaf-\nfective disorder from a depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, delusions\nor hallucinations must be present for at least 2 weeks in the absence of a major mood epi-\nsode (depressive or manic) at some point during the lifetime duration of the illness (Cri-\nterion B for schizoaffective disorder).

When deciding whether an individual’s presentation meets Criterion C,\nthe clinician should review the total duration of psychotic illness (i.e., both active and re-\nsidual symptoms) and determine when significant mood symptoms (untreated or in need\nof treatment with antidepressant and/or mood-stabilizing medication) accompanied the\npsychotic symptoms. This determination requires sufficient historical information and\nclinical judgment. For example, an individual with a 4-year history of active and residual\nsymptoms of schizophrenia develops depressive and manic episodes that, taken together,\ndo not occupy more than 1 year during the 4-year history of psychotic illness.

If a moderate or\nsevere substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced psychotic disor-\nder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance]\nuse disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the co-\nmorbid substance use disorder.

For drugs of abuse,\nthere must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of\nsubstance use, intoxication, or withdrawal. Substance/medication-induced psychotic\ndisorders arise during or soon after exposure to a medication or after substance intoxica-\ntion or withdrawal but can persist for weeks, whereas primary psychotic disorders may\nprecede the onset of substance/medication use or may occur during times of sustained ab-\nstinence. Once initiated, the psychotic symptoms may continue as long as the substance/\nmedication use continues. Another consideration is the presence of features that are atyp-\nical of a primary psychotic disorder (e.g., atypical age at onset or course). For example, the\nappearance of delusions de novo in a person older than 35 years without a known history\nof a primary psychotic disorder should suggest the possibility of a substance/medication-\ninduced psychotic disorder. Even a prior history of a primary psychotic disorder does not\nrule out the possibility of a substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. In contrast,\nfactors that suggest that the psychotic symptoms are better accounted for by a primary\npsychotic disorder include persistence of psychotic symptoms for a substantial period of\ntime (i.e., a month or more) after the end of substance intoxication or acute substance with-\ndrawal or after cessation of medication use; or a history of prior recurrent primary psy-\nchotic disorders. Other causes of psychotic symptoms must be considered even in an\nindividual with substance intoxication or withdrawal, because substance use problems are\nnot uncommon among individuals with non-substance/medication-induced psychotic\ndisorders.\nIn addition to the four symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the\nassessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making crit-\nically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-\nchotic disorders.", "associated_features": "Psychotic disorders can occur in association with intoxication with the following classes of\nsubstances: alcohol; cannabis; hallucinogens, including phencyclidine and related sub-\nstances; inhalants; sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics; stimulants (including cocaine);\nand other (or unknown) substances.

Olfactory hallucinations are suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy.

A “desire discrepancy,” in which a woman has lower desire for sexual activ-\nity than her partner, is not sufficient to diagnose female sexual interest/arousal disorder.\nIn order for the criteria for the disorder to be met, there must be absence or reduced fre-\nquency or intensity of at least three of six indicators (Criterion A) for a minimum duration\nof approximately 6 months (Criterion B). There may be different symptom profiles across\nwomen, as well as variability in how sexual interest and arousal are expressed. For exam-\nple, in one woman, sexual interest/arousal disorder may be expressed as a lack of interest\nin sexual activity, an absence of erotic or sexual thoughts, and reluctance to initiate sexual\nactivity and respond to a partner’s sexual invitations. In another woman, an inability to be-\ncome sexually excited, to respond to sexual stimuli with sexual desire, and a correspond-\n434\nSexual Dysfunctions\ning lack of signs of physical sexual arousal may be the primary features. Because sexual\ndesire and arousal frequently coexist and are elicited in response to adequate sexual cues,\nthe criteria for female sexual interest/arousal disorder take into account that difficulties in\ndesire and arousal often simultaneously characterize the complaints of women with this\ndisorder. Short-term changes in sexual interest or arousal are common and may be adaptive\nresponses to events in a woman’s life and do not represent a sexual dysfunction. Diagnosis\nof female sexual interest/arousal disorder requires a minimum duration of symptoms of\napproximately 6 months as a reflection that the symptoms must be a persistent problem.\nThe estimation of persistence may be determined by clinical judgment when a duration of\n6 months cannot be ascertained precisely.\nThere may be absent or reduced frequency or intensity of interest in sexual activity (Crite-\nrion A1), which was previously termed hypoactive sexual desire disorder. The frequency or inten-\nsity of sexual and erotic thoughts or fantasies may be absent or reduced (Criterion A2). The\nexpression of fantasies varies widely across women and may include memories of past sexual\nexperiences. The normative decline in sexual thoughts with age should be taken into account\nwhen this criterion is being assessed. Absence or reduced frequency of initiating sexual activ-\nity and of receptivity to a partner’s sexual invitations (Criterion A3) is a behaviorally focused\ncriterion. A couple’s beliefs and preferences for sexual initiation patterns are highly relevant to\nthe assessment of this criterion. There may be absent or reduced sexual excitement or pleasure\nduring sexual activity in almost all or all (approximately 75%–100%) sexual encounters (Cri-\nterion A4). Lack of pleasure is a common presenting clinical complaint in women with low de-\nsire. Among women who report low sexual desire, there are fewer sexual or erotic cues that\nelicit sexual interest or arousal (i.e., there is a lack of “responsive desire”). Assessment of the\nadequacy of sexual stimuli will assist in determining if there is a difficulty with responsive sex-\nual desire (Criterion A5). Frequency or intensity of genital or nongenital sensations during sex-\nual activity may be reduced or absent (Criterion A6). This may include reduced vaginal\nlubrication/vasocongestion, but because physiological measures of genital sexual response do\nnot differentiate women who report sexual arousal concerns from those who do not, the self-\nreport of reduced or absent genital or nongenital sensations is sufficient.\nFor a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder to be made, clinically signif-\nicant distress must accompany the symptoms in Criterion A. Distress may be experienced\nas a result of the lack of sexual interest/arousal or as a result of significant interference in\na woman’s life and well-being.

Because major diffi-\nculty in any one of these symptom dimensions is often sufficient to cause clinically sig-\nnificant distress, a diagnosis can be made on the basis of marked difficulty in only one\nsymptom dimension. However, all four symptom dimensions should be assessed even if a\ndiagnosis can be made on the basis of only one symptom dimension.\nMarked difficulty having vaginal intercourse/penetration (Criterion A1) can vary from a total in-\nability to experience vaginal penetration in any situation (e.g., intercourse, gynecological ex-\naminations, tampon insertion) to the ability to easily experience penetration in one situation\nand but not in another. Although the most common clinical situation is when a woman is un-\nable to experience intercourse or penetration with a partner, difficulties in undergoing re-\nquired gynecological examinations may also be present. Marked vulvovaginal or pelvic pain\nduring vaginal intercourse or penetration attempts (Criterion A2) refers to pain occurring in differ-\nent locations in the genito-pelvic area. Location of pain as well as intensity should be assessed.\nTypically, pain can be characterized as superficial (vulvovaginal or occurring during penetra-\ntion) or deep (pelvic; i.e., not felt until deeper penetration). The intensity of the pain is often not\nlinearly related to distress or interference with sexual intercourse or other sexual activities.\nSome genito-pelvic pain only occurs when provoked (i.e., by intercourse or mechanical stim-\n438\nSexual Dysfunctions\nulation); other genito-pelvic pain may be spontaneous as well as provoked. Genito-pelvic pain\ncan also be usefully characterized qualitatively (e.g., “burning,” “cutting,” “shooting,” “throb-\nbing”). The pain may persist for a period after intercourse is completed and may also occur\nduring urination. Typically, the pain experienced during sexual intercourse can be reproduced\nduring a gynecological examination.\nMarked fear or anxiety about vulvovaginal or pelvic pain either in anticipation of, or during, or\nas a result of vaginal penetration (Criterion A3) is commonly reported by women who have\nregularly experienced pain during sexual intercourse. This “normal” reaction may lead to\navoidance of sexual/intimate situations. In other cases, this marked fear does not appear\nto be closely related to the experience of pain but nonetheless leads to avoidance of inter-\ncourse and vaginal penetration situations. Some have described this as similar to a phobic\nreaction except that the phobic object may be vaginal penetration or the fear of pain.\nMarked tensing or tightening of the pelvic floor muscles during attempted vaginal penetration\n(Criterion A4) can vary from reflexive-like spasm of the pelvic floor in response to at-\ntempted vaginal entry to “normal/voluntary” muscle guarding in response to the antici-\npated or the repeated experience of pain or to fear or anxiety. In the case of “normal/\nguarding” reactions, penetration may be possible under circumstances of relaxation.

Sometimes desire and interest are preserved in sexual situations that are not painful or\ndo not require penetration. Even when individuals with genito-pelvic pain/penetration dis-\norder report sexual interest/motivation, there is often behavioral avoidance of sexual situ-\nations and opportunities. Avoidance of gynecological examinations despite medical\nrecommendations is also frequent. The pattern of avoidance is similar to that seen in phobic\ndisorders.

Apnea refers to the total absence of airflow, and hypopnea re-\nfers to a reduction in airflow. Each apnea or hypopnea represents a reduction in breathing\nof at least 10 seconds in duration in adults or two missed breaths in children and is typi-\ncally associated with drops in oxygen saturation of 3% or greater and/or an electroenceph-\nalographic arousal. Both sleep-related (nocturnal) and wake-time symptoms are common.\nThe cardinal symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea are snoring and daytime\nsleepiness.\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea in adults is diagnosed on the basis of polysom-\nnographic findings and symptoms. The diagnosis is based on symptoms of 1) nocturnal\nbreathing disturbances (i.e., snoring, snorting/gasping, breathing pauses during sleep), or\n2) daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or unrefreshing sleep despite sufficient opportunities to\nsleep that are not better explained by another mental disorder and not attributable to an-\nother medical condition, along with 3) evidence by polysomnography of five or more ob-\nstructive apneas or hypopneas per hour of sleep (Criterion A1). Diagnosis can be made in\nthe absence of these symptoms if there is evidence by polysomnography of 15 or more ob-\nstructive apneas and/or hypopneas per hour of sleep (Criterion A2).\nSpecific attention to disturbed sleep occurring in association with snoring or breathing\npauses and physical findings that increase risk of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea (e.g.,\ncentral obesity, crowded pharyngeal airway, elevated blood pressure) is needed to reduce\nthe chance of misdiagnosing this treatable condition.", "associated_features": "Because of the frequency of nocturnal awakenings that occur with obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea, individuals may report symptoms of insomnia. Other common, though non-\nspecific, symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea are heartburn, nocturia, morning\nheadaches, dry mouth, erectile dysfunction, and reduced libido. Rarely, individuals may\ncomplain of difficulty breathing while lying supine or sleeping. Hypertension may occur\nin more than 60% of individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea.", "prevalence": "Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is a very common disorder, affecting at least 1%–2% of\nchildren, 2%–15% of middle-age adults, and more than 20% of older individuals. In the\ngeneral community, prevalence rates of undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea\nmay be very high in elderly individuals. Since the disorder is strongly associated with obe-\nsity, increases in obesity rates are likely to be accompanied by an increased prevalence of\nthis disorder. Prevalence may be particularly high among males, older adults, and certain\nracial/ethnic groups. In adults, the male-to-female ratio of obstructive sleep apnea hypop-\nnea ranges from 2:1 to 4:1. Gender differences decline in older age, possibly because of an\nincreased prevalence in females after menopause. There is no gender difference among\nprepubertal children.", "development_course": "The age distribution of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea likely follows a J-shaped distri-\nbution. There is a peak in children ages 3–8 years when the nasopharynx may be compro-\nmised by a relatively large mass of tonsillar tissue compared with the size of the upper\n380\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nairway. With growth of the airway and regression of lymphoid tissue during later child-\nhood, there is reduction in prevalence. Then, as obesity prevalence increases in midlife and\nfemales enter menopause, obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea again increases. The course\nin older age is unclear; the disorder may level off after age 65 years, but in other individ-\nuals, prevalence may increase with aging. Because there is some age dependency of the oc-\ncurrence of apneas and hypopneas, polysomnographic results must be interpreted in light\nof other clinical data. In particular, significant clinical symptoms of insomnia or hyper-\nsomnia should be investigated regardless of the individual’s age.\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea usually has an insidious onset, gradual progression,\nand persistent course. Typically the loud snoring has been present for many years, often since\nchildhood, but an increase in its severity may lead the individual to seek evaluation. Weight\ngain may precipitate an increase in symptoms. Although obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea\ncan occur at any age, it most commonly manifests among individuals ages 40–60 years. Over\n4–5 years, the average apnea hypopnea index increases in adults and older individuals by ap-\nproximately two apneas/hypopneas per hour. The apnea hypopnea index is increased and in-\ncident obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is greater among individuals who are older, who are\nmale, or who have a higher baseline body mass index (BMI) or increase their BMI over time.\nSpontaneous resolution of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea has been reported with weight\nloss, particularly after bariatric surgery. In children, seasonal variation in obstructive sleep ap-\nnea hypopnea has been observed, as has improvement with overall growth.\nIn young children, the signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea may be\nmore subtle than in adults, making diagnosis more difficult to establish. Polysomnography is\nuseful in confirming diagnosis. Evidence of fragmentation of sleep on the polysomnogram\nmay not be as apparent as in studies of older individuals, possibly because of the high homeo-\nstatic drive in young individuals. Symptoms such as snoring are usually parent-reported and\nthus have reduced sensitivity. Agitated arousals and unusual sleep postures, such as sleeping\non the hands and knees, may occur. Nocturnal enuresis also may occur and should raise the\nsuspicion of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea if it recurs in a child who was previously dry at\nnight. Children may also manifest excessive daytime sleepiness, although this is not as com-\nmon or pronounced as in adults. Daytime mouth breathing, difficulty in swallowing, and poor\nspeech articulation are also common features in children. Children younger than 5 years more\noften present with nighttime symptoms, such as observed apneas or labored breathing, than\nwith behavioral symptoms (i.e., the nighttime symptoms are more noticeable and more often\nbring the child to clinical attention). In children older than 5 years, daytime symptoms such as\nsleepiness and behavioral problems (e.g., impulsivity and hyperactivity), attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder, learning difficulties, and morning headaches are more often the focus\nof concern. Children with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea also may present with failure to\nthrive and developmental delays. In young children, obesity is a less common risk factor,\nwhile delayed growth and “failure to thrive” may be present.", "risk_factors": "Genetic and physiological.\nThe major risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea\nare obesity and male gender. Others include maxillary-mandibular retrognathia or micro-\ngnathia, positive family history of sleep apnea, genetic syndromes that reduce upper\nairway patency (e.g., Down’s syndrome, Treacher Collin’s syndrome), adenotonsillar hy-\npertrophy (especially in young children), menopause (in females), and various endocrine\nsyndromes (e.g., acromegaly). Compared with premenopausal females, males are at in-\ncreased risk for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, possibly reflecting the influences of sex\nhormones on ventilatory control and body fat distribution, as well as because of gender\ndifferences in airway structure. Medications for mental disorders and medical conditions\nthat tend to induce somnolence may worsen the course of apnea symptoms if these med-\nications are not managed carefully.\nObstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea\n381\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea has a strong genetic basis, as evidenced by the sig-\nnificant familial aggregation of the apnea hypopnea index. The prevalence of obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea is approximately twice as high among the first-degree relatives of\nprobands with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea as compared with members of control\nfamilies. One-third of the variance in the apnea hypopnea index is explained by shared fa-\nmilial factors. Although genetic markers with diagnostic or prognostic value are not yet\navailable for use, eliciting a family history of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea should in-\ncrease the clinical suspicion for the disorder.", "cultural_issues": "There is a potential for sleepiness and fatigue to be reported differently across cultures. In\nsome groups, snoring may be considered a sign of health and thus may not trigger con-\ncerns. Individuals of Asian ancestry may be at increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea despite relatively low BMI, possibly reflecting the influence of craniofacial risk\nfactors that narrow the nasopharynx.\nGender-Related Issues\nFemales may more commonly report fatigue rather than sleepiness and may underreport\nsnoring.", "gender_issues": "", "diagnostic_markers": "Polysomnography provides quantitative data on frequency of sleep-related respiratory\ndisturbances and associated changes in oxygen saturation and sleep continuity. Polysom-\nnographic findings in children differ from those in adults in that children demonstrate\nlabored breathing, partial obstructive hypoventilation with cyclical desaturations, hyper-\ncapnia and paradoxical movements. Apnea hypopnea index levels as low as 2 are used to\ndefine thresholds of abnormality in children.\nArterial blood gas measurements while the individual is awake are usually normal, but\nsome individuals can have waking hypoxemia or hypercapnia. This pattern should alert the\nclinician to the possibility of coexisting lung disease or hypoventilation. Imaging procedures\nmay reveal narrowing of the upper airway. Cardiac testing may show evidence of impaired\nventricular function. Individuals with severe nocturnal oxygen desaturation may also have el-\nevated hemoglobin or hematocrit values. Validated sleep measures (e.g., multiple sleep la-\ntency test [MSLT], maintenance of wakefulness test) may identify sleepiness.", "suicide_risk": "", "functional_consequences": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea\nMore than 50% of individuals with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea\nreport symptoms of daytime sleepiness.

Individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea may additionally report\nnocturnal gasping and choking. The presence of sleepiness or other daytime symptoms\nnot explained by other etiologies suggests the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea hypop-\nnea, but this differentiation requires polysomnography. Definitive differential diagnosis\nbetween hypersomnia, central sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoventilation, and obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea also requires polysomnographic studies.\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea must be differentiated from other causes of sleepi-\nness, such as narcolepsy, hypersomnia, and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea can be differentiated from narcolepsy by the absence of cataplexy,\nsleep-related hallucinations, and sleep paralysis and by the presence of loud snoring,\ngasping during sleep, or observed apneas in sleep. Daytime sleep episodes in narcolepsy\nare characteristically shorter, more refreshing, and more often associated with dreaming.\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea shows characteristic apneas and hypopneas and oxy-\ngen desaturation during nocturnal polysomnographic studies. Narcolepsy results in mul-\ntiple sleep-onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods during the MSLT. Narcolepsy, like\nobstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, may be associated with obesity, and some individuals\nhave concurrent narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. A diagnosis of narco-\nlepsy does not exclude the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, as the two con-\nditions may co-occur.\nInsomnia disorder.\nFor individuals complaining of difficulty initiating or maintaining\nsleep or early-morning awakenings, insomnia disorder can be differentiated from obstruc-\ntive sleep apnea hypopnea by the absence of snoring and the absence of the history, signs,\nand symptoms characteristic of the latter disorder. However, insomnia and obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea may coexist, and if so, both disorders may need to be addressed\nconcurrently to improve sleep.\nPanic attacks.\nNocturnal panic attacks may include symptoms of gasping or choking\nduring sleep that may be difficult to distinguish clinically from obstructive sleep apnea hy-\npopnea. However, the lower frequency of episodes, intense autonomic arousal, and lack of\nexcessive sleepiness differentiate nocturnal panic attacks from obstructive sleep apnea hy-\npopnea. Polysomnography in individuals with nocturnal panic attacks does not reveal the\ntypical pattern of apneas or oxygen desaturation characteristic of obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea. Individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea do not provide a history of\ndaytime panic attacks.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in chil-\ndren may include symptoms of inattention, academic impairment, hyperactivity, and in-\nternalizing behaviors, all of which may also be symptoms of childhood obstructive sleep\napnea hypopnea. The presence of other symptoms and signs of childhood obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea (e.g., labored breathing or snoring during sleep and adenotonsillar\nhypertrophy) would suggest the presence of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Obstruc-\ntive sleep apnea hypopnea and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may commonly\nco-occur, and there may be causal links between them; therefore, risk factors such as en-\nlarged tonsils, obesity, or a family history of sleep apnea may help alert the clinician to\ntheir co-occurrence.\nSubstance/medication-induced insomnia or hypersomnia.\nSubstance use and substance\nwithdrawal (including medications) can produce insomnia or hypersomnia. A careful his-\ntory is usually sufficient to identify the relevant substance/medication, and follow-up\nshows improvement of the sleep disturbance after discontinuation of the substance/med-\nication. In other cases, the use of a substance/medication (e.g., alcohol, barbiturates, ben-\nzodiazepines, tobacco) has been shown to exacerbate obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea.\nAn individual with symptoms and signs consistent with obstructive sleep apnea hypop-\nCentral Sleep Apnea\n383\nnea should receive that diagnosis, even in the presence of concurrent substance use that is\nexacerbating the condition.", "comorbidity": "Systemic hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, diabetes, and increased\nmortality are consistently associated with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea.

The presence of blood gas abnormalities during wakefulness is an indicator of greater severity. Subtypes Regarding obesity hypoventilation disorder, the prevalence of obesity hypoventilation in the general population is not known but is thought to be increasing in association with the increased prevalence of obesity and extreme obesity. Diagnostic Features Sleep-related hypoventilation can occur independently or, more frequently, comorbid with medical or neurological disorders, medication use, or substance use disorder. Al- though symptoms are not mandatory to make this diagnosis, individuals often report excessive daytime sleepiness, frequent arousals and awakenings during sleep, morning headaches, and insomnia complaints. Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with sleep-related hypoventilation can present with sleep-related complaints of insomnia or sleepiness. Episodes of orthopnea can occur in individuals with diaphragm weakness. Headaches upon awakening may be present. During sleep, episodes of shallow breathing may be observed, and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea or central sleep apnea may coexist. Consequences of ventilatory insufficiency, including pulmonary hyperten- sion, cor pulmonale (right heart failure), polycythemia, and neurocognitive dysfunction, 388 Sleep-Wake Disorders can be present. With progression of ventilatory insufficiency, blood gas abnormalities ex- tend into wakefulness. Features of the medical condition causing sleep-related hypoven- tilation can also be present. Episodes of hypoventilation may be associated with frequent arousals or bradytachycardia. Individuals may complain of excessive sleepiness and in- somnia or morning headaches or may present with findings of neurocognitive dysfunction or depression. Hypoventilation may not be present during wakefulness. Prevalence Idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation in adults is very uncommon. The prevalence of congenital central alveolar hypoventilation is unknown, but the disorder is rare. Comor- bid sleep-related hypoventilation (i.e., hypoventilation comorbid with other conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], neuromuscular disorders, or obe- sity) is more common. Development and Course Idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation is thought to be a slowly progressive disorder of respiratory impairment. When this disorder occurs comorbidly with other disorders (e.g., COPD, neuromuscular disorders, obesity), disease severity reflects the severity of the un- derlying condition, and the disorder progresses as the condition worsens. Complications such as pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, cardiac dysrhythmias, polycythemia, neurocognitive dysfunction, and worsening respiratory failure can develop with increas- ing severity of blood gas abnormalities. Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation usually manifests at birth with shallow, erratic, or absent breathing. This disorder can also manifest during infancy, childhood, and adulthood because of variable penetrance of the PHOX2B mutation. Children with congenital central alveolar hypoventilation are more likely to have disorders of the auto- nomic nervous system, Hirschsprung’s disease, neural crest tumors, and characteristic box- shaped face (i.e., the face is short relative to its width). Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Ventilatory drive can be reduced in individuals using central nervous system depressants, including benzodiazepines, opiates, and alcohol. Genetic and physiological. Idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation is associated with reduced ventilatory drive due to a blunted chemoresponsiveness to CO2 (reduced respi- ratory drive; i.e., “won’t breathe”), reflecting underlying neurological deficits in centers governing the control of ventilation. More commonly, sleep-related hypoventilation is co- morbid with another medical condition, such as a pulmonary disorder, a neuromuscular or chest wall disorder, or hypothyroidism, or with use of medications (e.g., benzodiaze- pines, opiates). In these conditions, the hypoventilation may be a consequence of in- creased work of breathing and/or impairment of respiratory muscle function (i.e., “can’t breathe”) or reduced respiratory drive (i.e., “won’t breathe”). Neuromuscular disorders influence breathing through impairment of respiratory mo- tor innervation or respiratory muscle function. They include conditions such as amyo- trophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord injury, diaphragmatic paralysis, myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, toxic or metabolic myopathies, postpolio syndrome, and Char- cot-Marie-Tooth syndrome. Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation is a genetic disorder attributable to muta- tions of PHOX2B, a gene that is crucial for the development of the embryonic autonomic nervous system and neural crest derivatives. Children with congenital central alveolar hy- poventilation show blunted ventilatory responses to hypercapnia, especially in non–rapid eye movement sleep. Sleep-Related Hypoventilation 389 Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Gender distributions for sleep-related hypoventilation occurring in association with co- morbid conditions reflect the gender distributions of the comorbid conditions. For exam- ple, COPD is more frequently present in males and with increasing age. Diagnostic Markers Sleep-related hypoventilation is diagnosed using polysomnography showing sleep-related hypoxemia and hypercapnia that is not better explained by another breathing-related sleep disorder. The documentation of increased arterial pCO2 levels to greater than 55 mmHg during sleep or a 10 mmHg or greater increase in pCO2 levels (to a level that also exceeds 50 mmHg) during sleep in comparison to awake supine values, for 10 minutes or longer, is the gold standard for diagnosis. However, obtaining arterial blood gas determinations dur- ing sleep is impractical, and non-invasive measures of pCO2 have not been adequately val- idated during sleep and are not widely used during polysomnography in adults. Prolonged and sustained decreases in oxygen saturation (oxygen saturation of less than 90% for more than 5 minutes with a nadir of at least 85%, or oxygen saturation of less than 90% for at least 30% of sleep time) in the absence of evidence of upper airway obstruction are often used as an indication of sleep-related hypoventilation; however, this finding is not specific, as there are other potential causes of hypoxemia, such as that due to lung disease. Functional Consequences of Sleep-Related Hypoventilation The consequences of sleep-related hypoventilation are related to the effects of chronic ex- posure to hypercapnia and hypoxemia. These blood gas derangements cause vasocon- striction of the pulmonary vasculature leading to pulmonary hypertension, which, if severe, can result in right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale). Hypoxemia can lead to dys- function of organs such as the brain, blood, and heart, leading to outcomes such as cog- nitive dysfunction, polycythemia, and cardiac arrhythmias. Hypercapnia can depress ventilatory drive, leading to progressive respiratory failure. Differential Diagnosis Other medical conditions affecting ventilation. In adults, the idiopathic variety of sleep- related hypoventilation is very uncommon and is determined by excluding the presence of lung diseases, skeletal malformations, neuromuscular disorders, and other medical and neurological disorders or medications that affect ventilation. Sleep-related hypoventila- tion must be distinguished from other causes of sleep-related hypoxemia, such as that due to lung disease. Other breathing-related sleep disorders. Sleep-related hypoventilation can be distin- guished from obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and central sleep apnea based on clinical features and findings on polysomnography. Sleep-related hypoventilation typically shows more sustained periods of oxygen desaturation rather that the periodic episodes seen in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and central sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea hy- popnea and central sleep apnea also show a pattern of discrete episodes of repeated air- flow decreases that can be absent in sleep-related hypoventilation. Comorbidity Sleep-related hypoventilation often occurs in association with a pulmonary disorder (e.g., in- terstitial lung disease, COPD), with a neuromuscular or chest wall disorder (e.g., muscular dystrophies, post-polio syndrome, cervical spinal cord injury, obesity, kyphoscoliosis), or, 390 Sleep-Wake Disorders most relevant to the mental health provider, with medication use (e.g., benzodiazepines, opi- ates). Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation often occurs in association with autonomic dysfunction and may occur in association with Hirschsprung’s disease. COPD, a disorder of lower airway obstruction usually associated with cigarette smoking, can result in sleep- related hypoventilation and hypoxemia. The presence of coexisting obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is thought to exacerbate hypoxemia and hypercapnia during sleep and wakeful- ness. The relationship between congenital central alveolar hypoventilation and idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation is unclear; in some individuals, idiopathic sleep-related hy- poventilation may represent cases of late-onset congenital central alveolar hypoventilation. Relationship to International Classification of Sleep Disorders The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), combines sleep- related hypoventilation and sleep-related hypoxemia under the category of sleep-related hypoventilation/hypoxemic syndromes. This approach to classification reflects the fre- quent co-occurrence of disorders that lead to hypoventilation and hypoxemia. In contrast, the classification used in DSM-5 reflects evidence that there are distinct sleep-related pathogenetic processes leading to hypoventilation.", "subtypes": "", "specifiers": "", "recording_procedures": "", "diagnostic_features": "", "associated_features": "", "prevalence": "", "development_course": "", "risk_factors": "", "cultural_issues": "", "gender_issues": "", "diagnostic_markers": "", "suicide_risk": "", "functional_consequences": "", "differential_diagnosis": "", "comorbidity": ""}, "provenance": {"source_file": "sleep_wake_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 6, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.544327"}}

In narcolepsy\nsecondary to infectious (e.g., Whipple’s disease, sarcoidosis), traumatic, or tumoral de-\nstruction of hypocretin neurons, test results for HLA DQB1*06:02 may be positive and may\nresult from the insult triggering the autoimmune process. In other cases, the destruction of\nhypocretin neurons may be secondary to trauma or hypothalamic surgery. Head trauma\nor infections of the central nervous system can, however, produce transitory decreases in\nCSF hypocretin-1 levels without hypocretin cell loss, complicating the diagnosis.Breathing-Related Sleep Disorders\nThe breathing-related sleep disorders category encompasses three relatively distinct dis-\norders: obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, central sleep apnea, and sleep-related hypo-\nventilation.\nObstructive Sleep Apnea HypopneaIdiopathic central sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes breathing are characterized by increased\ngain of the ventilatory control system, also referred to as high loop gain, which leads to in-\nstability in ventilation and PaCO2 levels. This instability is termed periodic breathing and\ncan be recognized by hyperventilation alternating with hypoventilation. Individuals with\nthese disorders typically have pCO2 levels while awake that are slightly hypocapneic or\nnormocapneic. Central sleep apnea may also manifest during initiation of treatment of ob-\nstructive sleep apnea hypopnea or may occur in association with obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea syndrome (termed complex sleep apnea). The occurrence of central sleep apnea in\nassociation with obstructive sleep apnea is also considered to be due to high loop gain. In\ncontrast, the pathogenesis of central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use has been at-\ntributed to the effects of opioids on the respiratory rhythm generators in the medulla as\nwell as to its differential effects on hypoxic versus hypercapneic respiratory drive. These\nindividuals may have elevated pCO2 levels while awake. Individuals receiving chronic\nmethadone maintenance therapy have been noted to have increased somnolence and de-\npression, although the role of breathing disorders associated with opioid medication in caus-\ning these problems has not been studied.Regarding obesity hypoventilation disorder, the prevalence of obesity hypoventilation in\nthe general population is not known but is thought to be increasing in association with the\nincreased prevalence of obesity and extreme obesity.", "specifiers": "Disease severity is measured by a count of the number of apneas plus hypopneas per hour\nof sleep (apnea hypopnea index) using polysomnography or other overnight monitoring.\nOverall severity is also informed by levels of nocturnal desaturation and sleep fragmen-\ntation (measured by brain cortical arousal frequency and sleep stages) and degree of as-\nsociated symptoms and daytime impairment. However, the exact number and thresholds\nmay vary according to the specific measurement techniques used, and these numbers may\nchange over time. Regardless of the apnea hypopnea index (count) per se, the disorder is\nconsidered to be more severe when apneas and hypopneas are accompanied by significant\noxygen hemoglobin desaturation (e.g., when more than 10% of the sleep time is spent at\ndesaturation levels of less than 90%) or when sleep is severely fragmented as shown by an\nObstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea\n379\nelevated arousal index (arousal index greater than 30) or reduced stages in deep sleep (e.g.,\npercentage stage N3 [slow-wave sleep] less than 5%).An increase in the central apnea index (i.e., number of central apneas per hour of sleep) re-\nflects an increase in severity of central sleep apnea. Sleep continuity and quality may be\nmarkedly impaired with reductions in restorative stages of non–rapid eye movement (REM)\nsleep (i.e., decreased slow-wave sleep [stage N3]). In individuals with severe Cheyne-\nStokes breathing, the pattern can also be observed during resting wakefulness, a finding\nthat is thought to be a poor prognostic marker for mortality.Advanced sleep phase type may be documented with the specified “familial.” Although\nthe prevalence of familial advanced sleep phase type has not been established, a family\nhistory of advanced sleep phase is present in individuals with advanced sleep phase type.\nIn this type, specific mutations demonstrate an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.\nIn the familial form, onset of symptoms may occur earlier (during childhood and early\nadulthood), the course is persistent, and the severity of symptoms may increase with age.", "recording_procedures": "", "diagnostic_features": "Hypersomnolence is a broad diagnostic term and includes symptoms of excessive quantity\nof sleep (e.g., extended nocturnal sleep or involuntary daytime sleep), deteriorated quality\nof wakefulness (i.e., sleep propensity during wakefulness as shown by difficulty awaken-\ning or inability to remain awake when required), and sleep inertia (i.e., a period of im-\npaired performance and reduced vigilance following awakening from the regular sleep\nepisode or from a nap) (Criterion A). Individuals with this disorder fall asleep quickly and\nhave a good sleep efficiency (>90%). They may have difficulty waking up in the morning,\nsometimes appearing confused, combative, or ataxic. This prolonged impairment of alert-\nness at the sleep-wake transition is often referred to as sleep inertia (i.e., sleep drunkenness).\nIt can also occur upon awakening from a daytime nap. During that period, the individual\nappears awake, but there is a decline in motor dexterity, behavior may be very inappro-\npriate, and memory deficits, disorientation in time and space, and feelings of grogginess\nmay occur. This period may last some minutes to hours.\nThe persistent need for sleep can lead to automatic behavior (usually of a very routine,\nlow-complexity type) that the individual carries out with little or no subsequent recall. For\nexample, individuals may find themselves having driven several miles from where they\nthought they were, unaware of the “automatic” driving they did in the preceding minutes.\nFor some individuals with hypersomnolence disorder, the major sleep episode (for most\nindividuals, nocturnal sleep) has a duration of 9 hours or more. However, the sleep is often\nnonrestorative and is followed by difficulty awakening in the morning. For other individ-\nuals with hypersomnolence disorder, the major sleep episode is of normal nocturnal sleep\nduration (6–9 hours). In these cases, the excessive sleepiness is characterized by several un-\nintentional daytime naps. These daytime naps tend to be relatively long (often lasting 1 hour\nor more), are experienced as nonrestorative (i.e., unrefreshing), and do not lead to improved\nalertness. Individuals with hypersomnolence have daytime naps nearly everyday regard-\nless of the nocturnal sleep duration. Subjective sleep quality may or may not be reported as\ngood. Individuals typically feel sleepiness developing over a period of time, rather than\n370\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nexperiencing a sudden sleep “attack.” Unintentional sleep episodes typically occur in low-\nstimulation and low-activity situations (e.g., while attending lectures, reading, watching\ntelevision, or driving long distances), but in more severe cases they can manifest in high-\nattention situations such as at work, in meetings, or at social gatherings.The essential features of sleepiness in narcolepsy are recurrent daytime naps or lapses into\nsleep. Sleepiness typically occurs daily but must occur at a minimum three times a week\nfor at least 3 months (Criterion A). Narcolepsy generally produces cataplexy, which most\ncommonly presents as brief episodes (seconds to minutes) of sudden, bilateral loss of mus-\ncle tone precipitated by emotions, typically laughing and joking. Muscles affected may\ninclude those of the neck, jaw, arms, legs, or whole body, resulting in head bobbing, jaw\ndropping, or complete falls. Individuals are awake and aware during cataplexy. To meet\nCriterion B1(a), cataplexy must be triggered by laughter or joking and must occur at least\na few times per month when the condition is untreated or in the past.\nCataplexy should not be confused with “weakness” occurring in the context of athletic\nactivities (physiological) or exclusively after unusual emotional triggers such as stress or\nanxiety (suggesting possible psychopathology). Episodes lasting hours or days, or those not\ntriggered by emotions, are unlikely to be cataplexy, nor is rolling on the floor while laugh-\ning hysterically.\nIn children close to onset, genuine cataplexy can be atypical, affecting primarily the\nface, causing grimaces or jaw opening with tongue thrusting (“cataplectic faces”). Alter-\nnatively, cataplexy may present as low-grade continuous hypotonia, yielding a wobbling\nwalk. In these cases, Criterion B1(b) can be met in children or in individuals within 6 months\nof a rapid onset.\nNarcolepsy-cataplexy nearly always results from the loss of hypothalamic hypocretin\n(orexin)–producing cells, causing hypocretin deficiency (less than or equal to one-third of\ncontrol values, or 110 pg/mL in most laboratories). Cell loss is likely autoimmune, and ap-\nproximately 99% of affected individuals carry HLA-DQB1*06:02 (vs. 12%–38% of control\nsubjects). Thus, checking for the presence of DQB1*06:02 prior to a lumbar puncture for eval-\nuation of CSF hypocretin-1 immunoreactivity may be useful. Rarely, low CSF levels of hypo-\ncretin-1 occur without cataplexy, notably in youths who may develop cataplexy later. CSF\nhypocretin-1 measurement represents the gold standard, excepting associated severe con-\nditions (neurological, inflammatory, infectious, trauma) that can interfere with the assay.\nA nocturnal polysomnographic sleep study followed by an MSLT can also be used to\nconfirm the diagnosis (Criterion B3). These tests must be performed after the individual\nhas stopped all psychotropic medications, following 2 weeks of adequate sleep time (as\ndocumented with sleep diaries, actigraphy). Short rapid eye movement (REM) latency\n(sleep-onset REM period, REM latency less than or equal to 15 minutes) during polysom-\nnography is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis and meets Criterion B3. Alternatively, the\nMSLT result must be positive, showing a mean sleep latency of less than or equal to 8 min-\nutes and two or more sleep-onset REM periods in four to five naps.Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is the most common breathing-related sleep disorder.\nIt is characterized by repeated episodes of upper (pharyngeal) airway obstruction (apneas\nand hypopneas) during sleep. Apnea refers to the total absence of airflow, and hypopnea re-\nfers to a reduction in airflow. Each apnea or hypopnea represents a reduction in breathing\nof at least 10 seconds in duration in adults or two missed breaths in children and is typi-\ncally associated with drops in oxygen saturation of 3% or greater and/or an electroenceph-\nalographic arousal. Both sleep-related (nocturnal) and wake-time symptoms are common.\nThe cardinal symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea are snoring and daytime\nsleepiness.\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea in adults is diagnosed on the basis of polysom-\nnographic findings and symptoms. The diagnosis is based on symptoms of 1) nocturnal\nbreathing disturbances (i.e., snoring, snorting/gasping, breathing pauses during sleep), or\n2) daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or unrefreshing sleep despite sufficient opportunities to\nsleep that are not better explained by another mental disorder and not attributable to an-\nother medical condition, along with 3) evidence by polysomnography of five or more ob-\nstructive apneas or hypopneas per hour of sleep (Criterion A1). Diagnosis can be made in\nthe absence of these symptoms if there is evidence by polysomnography of 15 or more ob-\nstructive apneas and/or hypopneas per hour of sleep (Criterion A2).\nSpecific attention to disturbed sleep occurring in association with snoring or breathing\npauses and physical findings that increase risk of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea (e.g.,\ncentral obesity, crowded pharyngeal airway, elevated blood pressure) is needed to reduce\nthe chance of misdiagnosing this treatable condition.Central sleep apnea disorders are characterized by repeated episodes of apneas and hy-\npopneas during sleep caused by variability in respiratory effort. These are disorders of\nventilatory control in which respiratory events occur in a periodic or intermittent pattern.\nIdiopathic central sleep apnea is characterized by sleepiness, insomnia, and awakenings due\nto dyspnea in association with five or more central apneas per hour of sleep. Central sleep\napnea occurring in individuals with heart failure, stroke, or renal failure typically have a\nbreathing pattern called Cheyne-Stokes breathing, which is characterized by a pattern of\nperiodic crescendo-decrescendo variation in tidal volume that results in central apneas\nand hypopneas occurring at a frequency of at least five events per hour that are accompa-\nnied by frequent arousals. Central and obstructive sleep apneas may coexist; the ratio of\ncentral to obstructive apneas/hypopneas may be used to identify which condition is pre-\ndominant.\nAlterations in neuromuscular control of breathing can occur in association with med-\nications or substances used in individuals with mental health conditions, which can cause\nor exacerbate impairments of respiratory rhythm and ventilation. Individuals taking these\nmedications have a sleep-related breathing disorder that could contribute to sleep distur-\nbances and symptoms such as sleepiness, confusion, and depression. Specifically, chronic\nCentral Sleep Apnea\n385\nuse of long-acting opioid medications is often associated with impairment of respiratory con-\ntrol leading to central sleep apnea.Sleep-related hypoventilation can occur independently or, more frequently, comorbid\nwith medical or neurological disorders, medication use, or substance use disorder. Al-\nthough symptoms are not mandatory to make this diagnosis, individuals often report\nexcessive daytime sleepiness, frequent arousals and awakenings during sleep, morning\nheadaches, and insomnia complaints.The delayed sleep phase type is based primarily on a history of a delay in the timing of the\nmajor sleep period (usually more than 2 hours) in relation to the desired sleep and wake-\nup time, resulting in symptoms of insomnia and excessive sleepiness. When allowed to set\ntheir own schedule, individuals with delayed sleep phase type exhibit normal sleep qual-\nity and duration for age. Symptoms of sleep-onset insomnia, difficulty waking in the\nmorning, and excessive early day sleepiness are prominent.Advanced sleep phase type is characterized by sleep-wake times that are several hours\nearlier than desired or conventional times. Diagnosis is based primarily on a history of an\nadvance in the timing of the major sleep period (usually more than 2 hours) in relation to\nthe desired sleep and wake-up time, with symptoms of early morning insomnia and ex-\ncessive daytime sleepiness. When allowed to set their schedule, individuals with ad-\nvanced sleep phase type will exhibit normal sleep quality and duration for age.The diagnosis of irregular sleep-wake type is based primarily on a history of symptoms of\ninsomnia at night (during the usual sleep period) and excessive sleepiness (napping) dur-\ning the day. Irregular sleep-wake type is characterized by a lack of discernable sleep-wake\nCircadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders\n395\ncircadian rhythm. There is no major sleep period, and sleep is fragmented into at least\nthree periods during the 24-hour day.The diagnosis of non-24-hour sleep-wake type is based primarily on a history of symp-\ntoms of insomnia or excessive sleepiness related to abnormal synchronization between the\n24-hour light-dark cycle and the endogenous circadian rhythm. Individuals typically pre-\nsent with periods of insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or both, which alternate with short\nasymptomatic periods. Starting with the asymptomatic period, when the individual’s\nsleep phase is aligned to the external environment, sleep latency will gradually increase\nand the individual will complain of sleep-onset insomnia. As the sleep phase continues to\ndrift so that sleep time is now in the daytime, the individual will have trouble staying\nawake during the day and will complain of sleepiness. Because the circadian period is not\naligned to the external 24-hour environment, symptoms will depend on when an individ-\nual tries to sleep in relation to the circadian rhythm of sleep propensity.Diagnosis is primarily based on a history of the individual working outside of the normal\n8:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. daytime window (particularly at night) on a regularly scheduled (i.e.,\nnon-overtime) basis. Symptoms of excessive sleepiness at work, and impaired sleep at\nhome, on a persistent basis are prominent. Presence of both sets of symptoms are usually\nrequired for a diagnosis of shift work type. Typically, when the individual reverts to a day-\nwork routine, symptoms resolve. Although the etiology is slightly different, individuals\nwho travel across many time zones on a very frequent basis may experience effects similar\nto those experienced by individuals with shift work type who work rotating shifts.", "associated_features": "Nonrestorative sleep, automatic behavior, difficulties awakening in the morning, and\nsleep inertia, although common in hypersomnolence disorder, may also be seen in a variety\nof conditions, including narcolepsy. Approximately 80% of individuals with hyper-\nsomnolence report that their sleep is nonrestorative, and as many have difficulties awak-\nening in the morning. Sleep inertia, though less common (i.e., observed in 36%–50% of\nindividuals with hypersomnolence disorder), is highly specific to hypersomnolence. Short\nnaps (i.e., duration of less than 30 minutes) are often unrefreshing. Individuals with hy-\npersomnolence often appear sleepy and may even fall asleep in the clinician’s waiting\narea.\nA subset of individuals with hypersomnolence disorder have a family history of hy-\npersomnolence and also have symptoms of autonomic nervous system dysfunction, in-\ncluding recurrent vascular-type headaches, reactivity of the peripheral vascular system\n(Raynaud’s phenomenon), and fainting.When sleepiness is severe, automatic behaviors may occur, with the individual continuing\nhis or her activities in a semi-automatic, hazelike fashion without memory or conscious-\nness. Approximately 20%–60% of individuals experience vivid hypnagogic hallucinations\nNarcolepsy\n375\nbefore or upon falling asleep or hypnopompic hallucinations just after awakening. These\nhallucinations are distinct from the less vivid, nonhallucinatory dreamlike mentation at\nsleep onset that occurs in normal sleepers. Nightmares and vivid dreaming are also fre-\nquent in narcolepsy, as is REM sleep behavior disorder. Approximately 20%–60% of indi-\nviduals experience sleep paralysis upon falling asleep or awakening, leaving them awake\nbut unable to move or speak. However, many normal sleepers also report sleep paralysis,\nespecially with stress or sleep deprivation. Nocturnal eating may occur. Obesity is com-\nmon. Nocturnal sleep disruption with frequent long or short awakenings is common and\ncan be disabling.\nIndividuals may appear sleepy or fall asleep in the waiting area or during clinical ex-\namination. During cataplexy, individuals may slump in a chair and have slurred speech or\ndrooping eyelids. If the clinician has time to check reflexes during cataplexy (most attacks\nare less than 10 seconds), reflexes are abolished—an important finding distinguishing gen-\nuine cataplexy from conversion disorder.Because of the frequency of nocturnal awakenings that occur with obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea, individuals may report symptoms of insomnia. Other common, though non-\nspecific, symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea are heartburn, nocturia, morning\nheadaches, dry mouth, erectile dysfunction, and reduced libido. Rarely, individuals may\ncomplain of difficulty breathing while lying supine or sleeping. Hypertension may occur\nin more than 60% of individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea.Individuals with central sleep apnea hypopneas can manifest with sleepiness or insomnia.\nThere can be complaints of sleep fragmentation, including awakening with dyspnea.\nSome individuals are asymptomatic. Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea can coexist with\nCheyne-Stokes breathing, and thus snoring and abruptly terminating apneas may be ob-\nserved during sleep.Individuals with sleep-related hypoventilation can present with sleep-related complaints\nof insomnia or sleepiness. Episodes of orthopnea can occur in individuals with diaphragm\nweakness. Headaches upon awakening may be present. During sleep, episodes of shallow\nbreathing may be observed, and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea or central sleep apnea\nmay coexist. Consequences of ventilatory insufficiency, including pulmonary hyperten-\nsion, cor pulmonale (right heart failure), polycythemia, and neurocognitive dysfunction,\n388\nSleep-Wake Disorders\ncan be present. With progression of ventilatory insufficiency, blood gas abnormalities ex-\ntend into wakefulness. Features of the medical condition causing sleep-related hypoven-\ntilation can also be present. Episodes of hypoventilation may be associated with frequent\narousals or bradytachycardia. Individuals may complain of excessive sleepiness and in-\nsomnia or morning headaches or may present with findings of neurocognitive dysfunction\nor depression. Hypoventilation may not be present during wakefulness.Common associated features of delayed sleep phase type include a history of mental dis-\norders or a concurrent mental disorder. Extreme and prolonged difficulty awakening with\nmorning confusion is also common. Psychophysiological insomnia may develop as a re-\nsult of maladaptive behaviors that impair sleep and increase arousal because of repeated\nattempts to fall asleep at an earlier time.Individuals with advanced sleep phase type are “morning types,” having earlier sleep-\nwake times, with the timing of circadian biomarkers such as melatonin and core body tem-\nperature rhythms occurring 2–4 hours earlier than normal. When required to keep a con-\nventional schedule requiring a delay of bedtime, these individuals will continue to have an\nearly rise time, leading to persistent sleep deprivation and daytime sleepiness. Use of hyp-\nnotics or alcohol to combat sleep-maintenance insomnia and stimulants to reduce daytime\nsleepiness may lead to substance abuse in these individuals.Individuals with irregular sleep-wake type typically present with insomnia or excessive\nsleepiness, depending on the time of day. Sleep and wake periods across 24 hours are frag-\nmented, although the longest sleep period tends to occur between 2:00 A.M. and 6:00 A.M.\nand is usually less than 4 hours. A history of isolation or reclusion may occur in association\nwith the disorder and contribute to the symptoms via a lack of external stimuli to help en-\ntrain a normal pattern. Individuals or their caregivers report frequent naps throughout the\nday. Irregular sleep-wake type is most commonly associated with neurodegenerative dis-\norders, such as major neurocognitive disorder, and many neurodevelopmental disorders\nin children.Non-24-hour sleep-wake type is most common among blind or visually impaired individ-\nuals who have decreased light perception. In sighted individuals, there is often a history of\ndelayed sleep phase and of decreased exposure to light and structured social and physical\nactivity. Sighted individuals with non-24-hour sleep-wake type also demonstrate in-\ncreased sleep duration.", "prevalence": "Approximately 5%–10% of individuals who consult in sleep disorders clinics with com-\nplaints of daytime sleepiness are diagnosed as having hypersomnolence disorder. It is es-\ntimated that about 1% of the European and U.S. general population has episodes of sleep\ninertia. Hypersomnolence occurs with relatively equal frequency in males and females.Narcolepsy-cataplexy affects 0.02%–0.04% of the general population in most countries.\nNarcolepsy affects both genders, with possibly a slight male preponderance.Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is a very common disorder, affecting at least 1%–2% of\nchildren, 2%–15% of middle-age adults, and more than 20% of older individuals. In the\ngeneral community, prevalence rates of undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea\nmay be very high in elderly individuals. Since the disorder is strongly associated with obe-\nsity, increases in obesity rates are likely to be accompanied by an increased prevalence of\nthis disorder. Prevalence may be particularly high among males, older adults, and certain\nracial/ethnic groups. In adults, the male-to-female ratio of obstructive sleep apnea hypop-\nnea ranges from 2:1 to 4:1. Gender differences decline in older age, possibly because of an\nincreased prevalence in females after menopause. There is no gender difference among\nprepubertal children.The prevalence of idiopathic central sleep apnea is unknown but thought to be rare. Thetricular ejection fraction. In individuals with an ejection fraction of less than 45%, the prev-\nalence has been reported to be 20% or higher. The male-to-female ratio for prevalence is\neven more highly skewed toward males than for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Prev-\nalence increases with age, and most patients are older than 60 years. Cheyne-Stokes breath-\ning occurs in approximately 20% of individuals with acute stroke. Central sleep apnea\ncomorbid with opioid use occurs in approximately 30% of individuals taking chronic opi-\noids for nonmalignant pain and similarly in individuals receiving methadone mainte-\nnance therapy.Idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation in adults is very uncommon. The prevalence of\ncongenital central alveolar hypoventilation is unknown, but the disorder is rare. Comor-\nbid sleep-related hypoventilation (i.e., hypoventilation comorbid with other conditions,\nsuch as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], neuromuscular disorders, or obe-\nsity) is more common.but appears to be greater than 7% in adolescents. Although the prevalence of familial de-\nlayed sleep phase type has not been established, a family history of delayed sleep phase is\npresent in individuals with delayed sleep phase type.The estimated prevalence of advanced sleep phase type is approximately 1% in middle-\nage adults. Sleep-wake times and circadian phase advance in older individuals, probably\naccounting for increased prevalence in this population.disorder appears rare in sighted individuals. The prevalence in blind individuals is esti-\nmated to be 50%.The prevalence of shift work type is unclear, but the disorder is estimated to affect 5%–10%\nof the night worker population (16%–20% of the workforce). Prevalence rises with advance-\nment into middle-age and beyond (Drake et al. 2004).\n398\nSleep-Wake Disorders", "development_course": "Hypersomnolence disorder has a persistent course, with a progressive evolution in the se-\nverity of symptoms. In most extreme cases, sleep episodes can last up to 20 hours. How-\never, the average nighttime sleep duration is around 9½ hours. While many individuals\nwith hypersomnolence are able to reduce their sleep time during working days, weekend\nand holiday sleep is greatly increased (by up to 3 hours). Awakenings are very difficult\nand accompanied by sleep inertia episodes in nearly 40% of cases. Hypersomnolence fully\nmanifests in most cases in late adolescence or early adulthood, with a mean age at onset of\n17–24 years. Individuals with hypersomnolence disorder are diagnosed, on average, 10–15\nyears after the appearance of the first symptoms. Pediatric cases are rare.\nHypersomnolence has a progressive onset, with symptoms beginning between ages 15\nand 25 years, with a gradual progression over weeks to months. For most individuals, the\ncourse is then persistent and stable, unless treatment is initiated. The development of other\nsleep disorders (e.g., breathing-related sleep disorder) may worsen the degree of sleepi-\nness. Although hyperactivity may be one of the presenting signs of daytime sleepiness in\nchildren, voluntary napping increases with age. This normal phenomenon is distinct from\nhypersomnolence.Onset is typically in children and adolescents/young adults but rarely in older adults.\nTwo peaks of onset are suggested, at ages 15–25 years and ages 30–35 years. Onset can be\nabrupt or progressive (over years). Severity is highest when onset is abrupt in children,\nand then decreases with age or with treatment, so that symptoms such as cataplexy can oc-\ncasionally disappear. Abrupt onset in young, prepubescent children can be associated\nwith obesity and premature puberty, a phenotype more frequently observed since 2009. In\nadolescents, onset is more difficult to pinpoint. Onset in adults is often unclear, with some\nindividuals reporting having had excessive sleepiness since birth. Once the disorder has\nmanifested, the course is persistent and lifelong.\nIn 90% of cases, the first symptom to manifest is sleepiness or increased sleep, followed\nby cataplexy (within 1 year in 50% of cases, within 3 years in 85%). Sleepiness, hypnagogic\nhallucinations, vivid dreaming, and REM sleep behavior disorder (excessive movements\nduring REM sleep) are early symptoms. Excessive sleep rapidly progresses to an inability\nto stay awake during the day, and to maintain good sleep at night, without a clear increase\nin total 24-hour sleep needs. In the first months, cataplexy may be atypical, especially in\nchildren. Sleep paralysis usually develops around puberty in children with prepubertal\nonset. Exacerbations of symptoms suggest lack of compliance with medications or devel-\nopment of a concurrent sleep disorder, notably sleep apnea.\nYoung children and adolescents with narcolepsy often develop aggression or behav-\nioral problems secondary to sleepiness and/or nighttime sleep disruption. Workload and\nsocial pressure increase through high school and college, reducing available sleep time at\nnight. Pregnancy does not seem to modify symptoms consistently. After retirement, indi-\nviduals typically have more opportunity for napping, reducing the need for stimulants.\nMaintaining a regular schedule benefits individuals at all ages.The age distribution of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea likely follows a J-shaped distri-\nbution. There is a peak in children ages 3–8 years when the nasopharynx may be compro-\nmised by a relatively large mass of tonsillar tissue compared with the size of the upper\n380\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nairway. With growth of the airway and regression of lymphoid tissue during later child-\nhood, there is reduction in prevalence. Then, as obesity prevalence increases in midlife and\nfemales enter menopause, obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea again increases. The course\nin older age is unclear; the disorder may level off after age 65 years, but in other individ-\nuals, prevalence may increase with aging. Because there is some age dependency of the oc-\ncurrence of apneas and hypopneas, polysomnographic results must be interpreted in light\nof other clinical data. In particular, significant clinical symptoms of insomnia or hyper-\nsomnia should be investigated regardless of the individual’s age.\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea usually has an insidious onset, gradual progression,\nand persistent course. Typically the loud snoring has been present for many years, often since\nchildhood, but an increase in its severity may lead the individual to seek evaluation. Weight\ngain may precipitate an increase in symptoms. Although obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea\ncan occur at any age, it most commonly manifests among individuals ages 40–60 years. Over\n4–5 years, the average apnea hypopnea index increases in adults and older individuals by ap-\nproximately two apneas/hypopneas per hour. The apnea hypopnea index is increased and in-\ncident obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is greater among individuals who are older, who are\nmale, or who have a higher baseline body mass index (BMI) or increase their BMI over time.\nSpontaneous resolution of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea has been reported with weight\nloss, particularly after bariatric surgery. In children, seasonal variation in obstructive sleep ap-\nnea hypopnea has been observed, as has improvement with overall growth.\nIn young children, the signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea may be\nmore subtle than in adults, making diagnosis more difficult to establish. Polysomnography is\nuseful in confirming diagnosis. Evidence of fragmentation of sleep on the polysomnogram\nmay not be as apparent as in studies of older individuals, possibly because of the high homeo-\nstatic drive in young individuals. Symptoms such as snoring are usually parent-reported and\nthus have reduced sensitivity. Agitated arousals and unusual sleep postures, such as sleeping\non the hands and knees, may occur. Nocturnal enuresis also may occur and should raise the\nsuspicion of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea if it recurs in a child who was previously dry at\nnight. Children may also manifest excessive daytime sleepiness, although this is not as com-\nmon or pronounced as in adults. Daytime mouth breathing, difficulty in swallowing, and poor\nspeech articulation are also common features in children. Children younger than 5 years more\noften present with nighttime symptoms, such as observed apneas or labored breathing, than\nwith behavioral symptoms (i.e., the nighttime symptoms are more noticeable and more often\nbring the child to clinical attention). In children older than 5 years, daytime symptoms such as\nsleepiness and behavioral problems (e.g., impulsivity and hyperactivity), attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder, learning difficulties, and morning headaches are more often the focus\nof concern. Children with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea also may present with failure to\nthrive and developmental delays. In young children, obesity is a less common risk factor,\nwhile delayed growth and “failure to thrive” may be present.The onset of Cheyne-Stokes breathing appears tied to the development of heart failure. The\nCheyne-Stokes breathing pattern is associated with oscillations in heart rate, blood pres-\nsure and oxygen desaturation, and elevated sympathetic nervous system activity that can\npromote progression of heart failure. The clinical significance of Cheyne-Stokes breathing\nin the setting of stroke is not known, but Cheyne-Stokes breathing may be a transient find-\ning that resolves with time after acute stroke. Central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid\nuse has been documented with chronic use (i.e., several months).Idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation is thought to be a slowly progressive disorder of\nrespiratory impairment. When this disorder occurs comorbidly with other disorders (e.g.,\nCOPD, neuromuscular disorders, obesity), disease severity reflects the severity of the un-\nderlying condition, and the disorder progresses as the condition worsens. Complications\nsuch as pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, cardiac dysrhythmias, polycythemia,\nneurocognitive dysfunction, and worsening respiratory failure can develop with increas-\ning severity of blood gas abnormalities.\nCongenital central alveolar hypoventilation usually manifests at birth with shallow,\nerratic, or absent breathing. This disorder can also manifest during infancy, childhood,\nand adulthood because of variable penetrance of the PHOX2B mutation. Children with\ncongenital central alveolar hypoventilation are more likely to have disorders of the auto-\nnomic nervous system, Hirschsprung’s disease, neural crest tumors, and characteristic box-\nshaped face (i.e., the face is short relative to its width).Course is persistent, lasting longer than 3 months, with intermittent exacerbations through-\nout adulthood. Although age at onset is variable, symptoms begin typically in adolescence\nand early adulthood and persist for several months to years before diagnosis is estab-\nlished. Severity may decrease with age. Relapse of symptoms is common.\nClinical expression may vary across the lifespan depending on social, school, and work\nobligations. Exacerbation is usually triggered by a change in work or school schedule that\nrequires an early rise time. Individuals who can alter their work schedules to accommo-\ndate the delayed circadian sleep and wake timing can experience remission of symptoms.\nIncreased prevalence in adolescence may be a consequence of both physiological and be-\nhavioral factors. Hormonal changes may be involved specifically, as delayed sleep phase is as-\nsociated with the onset of puberty. Thus, delayed sleep phase type in adolescents should be\ndifferentiated from the common delay in the timing of circadian rhythms in this age group. In\nthe familial form, the course is persistent and may not improve significantly with age.\n392\nSleep-Wake DisordersOnset is usually in late adulthood. In the familial form, onset can be earlier. The course is typ-\nically persistent, lasting more than 3 months, but the severity may increase depending on work\nand social schedules. The advanced sleep phase type is more common in older adults.\nClinical expression may vary across the lifespan depending on social, school, and work\nobligations. Individuals who can alter their work schedules to accommodate the advanced\ncircadian sleep and wake timing can experience remission of symptoms. Increasing age\ntends to advance the sleep phase, however, it is unclear whether the common age-associ-\nated advanced sleep phase type is due solely to a change in circadian timing (as seen in the\nfamilial form) or also to age-related changes in the homeostatic regulation of sleep, result-\ning in earlier awakening. Severity, remission, and relapse of symptoms suggest lack of ad-\nherence to behavioral and environmental treatments designed to control sleep and wake\nstructure and light exposure.\n394\nSleep-Wake DisordersThe course of irregular sleep-wake type is persistent. Age at onset is variable, but the dis-\norder is more common in older adults.Course of non-24-hour sleep-wake type is persistent, with intermittent remission and ex-\nacerbations due to changes in work and social schedules throughout the lifespan. Age at\nonset is variable, depending on the onset of visual impairment. In sighted individuals, be-\ncause of the overlap with delayed sleep phase type, non-24-hour sleep-wake type may de-\nvelop in adolescence or early adulthood. Remission and relapse of symptoms in blind and\nsighted individuals largely depend on adherence to treatments designed to control sleep\nand wake structure and light exposure.\nClinical expression may vary across the lifespan depending on social, school, and work\nobligations. In adolescents and adults, irregular sleep-wake schedules and exposure to\nlight or lack of light at critical times of the day can exacerbate the effects of sleep loss and\ndisrupt circadian entrainment. Consequently, symptoms of insomnia, daytime sleepiness,\nand school, professional, and interpersonal functioning may worsen.Shift work type can appear in individuals of any age but is more prevalent in individuals\nolder than 50 years and typically worsens with the passage of time if the disruptive work\nhours persist. Although older adults may show similar rates of circadian phase adjust-\nment to a change in routine as do younger adults, they appear to experience significantly\nmore sleep disruption as a consequence of the circadian phase shift.", "risk_factors": "Environmental.\nHypersomnolence can be increased temporarily by psychological stress\nand alcohol use, but they have not been documented as environmental precipitating\nfactors. Viral infections have been reported to have preceded or accompanied hyper-\nsomnolence in about 10% of cases. Viral infections, such as HIV pneumonia, infectious\nmononucleosis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome, can also evolve into hypersomnolence within\nHypersomnolence Disorder\n371\nmonths after the infection.

Head trauma and abrupt changes in sleep-wake\npatterns (e.g., job changes, stress) may be additional triggers.\nGenetic and physiological.\nMonozygotic twins are 25%–32% concordant for narcolepsy.\nThe prevalence of narcolepsy is 1%–2% in first-degree relatives (a 10- to 40-fold increase\noverall). Narcolepsy is strongly associated with DQB1*06:02 (99% vs. 12%–38% in control\nsubjects of various ethnic groups; 25% in the general U.S. population). DQB1*03:01 in-\ncreases, while DQB1*05:01, DQB1*06:01, and DQB1*06:03 reduce risk in the presence of\nDQB1*06:02, but the effect is small. Polymorphisms within the T-cell receptor alpha gene\nand other immune modulating genes also modulate risk slightly.Genetic and physiological.\nThe major risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea\nare obesity and male gender. Others include maxillary-mandibular retrognathia or micro-\ngnathia, positive family history of sleep apnea, genetic syndromes that reduce upper\nairway patency (e.g., Down’s syndrome, Treacher Collin’s syndrome), adenotonsillar hy-\npertrophy (especially in young children), menopause (in females), and various endocrine\nsyndromes (e.g., acromegaly). Compared with premenopausal females, males are at in-\ncreased risk for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, possibly reflecting the influences of sex\nhormones on ventilatory control and body fat distribution, as well as because of gender\ndifferences in airway structure. Medications for mental disorders and medical conditions\nthat tend to induce somnolence may worsen the course of apnea symptoms if these med-\nications are not managed carefully.\nObstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea\n381\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea has a strong genetic basis, as evidenced by the sig-\nnificant familial aggregation of the apnea hypopnea index. The prevalence of obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea is approximately twice as high among the first-degree relatives of\nprobands with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea as compared with members of control\nfamilies. One-third of the variance in the apnea hypopnea index is explained by shared fa-\nmilial factors. Although genetic markers with diagnostic or prognostic value are not yet\navailable for use, eliciting a family history of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea should in-\ncrease the clinical suspicion for the disorder.Genetic and physiological.\nCheyne-Stokes breathing is frequently present in individu-\nals with heart failure. The coexistence of atrial fibrillation further increases risk, as do older\nage and male gender. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is also seen in association with acute stroke\nand possibly renal failure. The underlying ventilatory instability in the setting of heart fail-\nure has been attributed to increased ventilatory chemosensitivity and hyperventilation\ndue to pulmonary vascular congestion and circulatory delay. Central sleep apnea is seen\nin individuals taking long-acting opioids.Environmental.\nVentilatory drive can be reduced in individuals using central nervous\nsystem depressants, including benzodiazepines, opiates, and alcohol.\nGenetic and physiological.\nIdiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation is associated with\nreduced ventilatory drive due to a blunted chemoresponsiveness to CO2 (reduced respi-\nratory drive; i.e., “won’t breathe”), reflecting underlying neurological deficits in centers\ngoverning the control of ventilation. More commonly, sleep-related hypoventilation is co-\nmorbid with another medical condition, such as a pulmonary disorder, a neuromuscular\nor chest wall disorder, or hypothyroidism, or with use of medications (e.g., benzodiaze-\npines, opiates). In these conditions, the hypoventilation may be a consequence of in-\ncreased work of breathing and/or impairment of respiratory muscle function (i.e., “can’t\nbreathe”) or reduced respiratory drive (i.e., “won’t breathe”).\nNeuromuscular disorders influence breathing through impairment of respiratory mo-\ntor innervation or respiratory muscle function. They include conditions such as amyo-\ntrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord injury, diaphragmatic paralysis, myasthenia gravis,\nLambert-Eaton syndrome, toxic or metabolic myopathies, postpolio syndrome, and Char-\ncot-Marie-Tooth syndrome.\nCongenital central alveolar hypoventilation is a genetic disorder attributable to muta-\ntions of PHOX2B, a gene that is crucial for the development of the embryonic autonomic\nnervous system and neural crest derivatives. Children with congenital central alveolar hy-\npoventilation show blunted ventilatory responses to hypercapnia, especially in non–rapid\neye movement sleep.\nSleep-Related Hypoventilation\n389Genetic and physiological.\nPredisposing factors may include a longer than average cir-\ncadian period, changes in light sensitivity, and impaired homeostatic sleep drive. Some in-\ndividuals with delayed sleep phase type may be hypersensitive to evening light, which\ncan serve as a delay signal to the circadian clock, or they may be hyposensitive to morning\nlight such that its phase-advancing effects are reduced. Genetic factors may play a role in\nthe pathogenesis of familial and sporadic forms of delayed sleep phase type, including\nmutations in circadian genes (e.g., PER3, CKIe).Environmental.\nDecreased late afternoon/early evening exposure to light and/or expo-\nsure to early morning light due to early morning awakening can increase the risk of ad-\nvanced sleep phase type by advancing circadian rhythms. By going to bed early, these\nindividuals are not exposed to light in the phase delay region of the curve, resulting in per-\npetuation of advanced phase. In familial advanced sleep phase type, a shortening of the\nendogenous circadian period can result in an advanced sleep phase, although circadian pe-\nriod does not appear to systematically decrease with age.\nGenetic and physiological.\nAdvanced sleep phase type has demonstrated an autoso-\nmal dominant mode of inheritance, including a PER2 gene mutation causing hypophos-\nphorylation of the PER2 protein and a missense mutation in CKI.Temperamental.\nNeurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s\ndisease, and Huntington’s disease, and neurodevelopmental disorders in children in-\ncrease the risk for irregular sleep-wake type.\nEnvironmental.\nDecreased exposure to environmental light and structured daytime ac-\ntivity can be associated with a low-amplitude circadian rhythm. Hospitalized individuals\nare especially prone to such weak external entraining stimuli, and even outside the hospi-\ntal setting, individuals with major neurocognitive disorder (i.e., dementia) are exposed to\nsignificantly less bright light.Environmental.\nIn sighted individuals, decreased exposure or sensitivity to light and so-\ncial and physical activity cues may contribute to a free-running circadian rhythm. With the\nCircadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders\n397\nhigh frequency of mental disorders involving social isolation and cases of non-24-hour\nsleep-wake type developing after a change in sleep habits (e.g., night shift work, job loss),\nbehavioral factors in combination with physiological tendency may precipitate and per-\npetuate this disorder in sighted individuals. Hospitalized individuals with neurological and\npsychiatric disorders can become insensitive to social cues, predisposing them to the de-\nvelopment of non-24-hour sleep-wake type.\nGenetic and physiological.\nBlindness is a risk factor for non-24-hour sleep-wake type.\nNon-24-hour sleep-wake type has been associated with traumatic brain injury.Temperamental.\nPredisposing factors include a morning-type disposition, a need for\nlong (i.e., more than 8 hours) sleep durations in order to feel well rested, and strong com-\npeting social and domestic needs (e.g., parents of young children). Individuals who are able\nto commit to a nocturnal lifestyle, with few competing day-oriented demands, appear at\nlower risk for shift work type.\nGenetic and physiological.\nBecause shift workers are more likely than day workers to\nbe obese, obstructive sleep apnea may be present and may exacerbate the symptoms.", "cultural_issues": "Narcolepsy has been described in all ethnic groups and in many cultures. Among African\nAmericans, more cases present without cataplexy or with atypical cataplexy, complicating\ndiagnosis, especially in the presence of obesity and obstructive sleep apnea.There is a potential for sleepiness and fatigue to be reported differently across cultures. In\nsome groups, snoring may be considered a sign of health and thus may not trigger con-\ncerns. Individuals of Asian ancestry may be at increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea despite relatively low BMI, possibly reflecting the influence of craniofacial risk\nfactors that narrow the nasopharynx.\nGender-Related Issues\nFemales may more commonly report fatigue rather than sleepiness and may underreport\nsnoring.African Americans may have a shorter circadian period and larger magnitude phase ad-\nvances to light than do Caucasians, possibly increasing the risk for development of ad-\nvanced sleep phase type in this population.", "gender_issues": "Gender distributions for sleep-related hypoventilation occurring in association with co-\nmorbid conditions reflect the gender distributions of the comorbid conditions. For exam-\nple, COPD is more frequently present in males and with increasing age.", "diagnostic_markers": "Nocturnal polysomnography demonstrates a normal to prolonged sleep duration, short\nsleep latency, and normal to increased sleep continuity. The distribution of rapid eye\nmovement (REM) sleep is also normal. Sleep efficiency is mostly greater than 90%. Some\nindividuals with hypersomnolence disorder have increased amounts of slow-wave sleep.\nThe multiple sleep latency test documents sleep tendency, typically indicated by mean\nsleep latency values of less than 8 minutes. In hypersomnolence disorder, the mean sleep\nlatency is typically less than 10 minutes and frequently 8 minutes or less. Sleep-onset REM\nperiods (SOREMPs; i.e., the occurrence of REM sleep within 20 minutes of sleep onset)\nmay be present but occur less than two times in four to five nap opportunities.Functional imaging suggests impaired hypothalamic responses to humorous stimuli.\nNocturnal polysomnography followed by an MSLT is used to confirm the diagnosis of\nnarcolepsy, especially when the disorder is first being diagnosed and before treatment has\nbegun, and if hypocretin deficiency has not been documented biochemically. The poly-\nsomnography/MSLT should be performed after the individual is no longer taking any\npsychotropic drugs and after regular sleep-wake patterns, without shift work or sleep de-\nprivation, have been documented.\nA sleep-onset REM period during the polysomnography (REM sleep latency less than\nor equal to 15 minutes) is highly specific (approximately 1% positive in control subjects)\nbut moderately sensitive (approximately 50%). A positive MSLT result displays an aver-\nage sleep latency of less than or equal to 8 minutes, and sleep-onset REM periods in two or\nmore naps on a four- or five-nap test. The MSLT result is positive in 90%–95% of individ-\nuals with narcolepsy versus 2%–4% of control subjects or individuals with other sleep dis-\norders. Additional polysomnographic findings often include frequent arousals, decreased\nsleep efficiency, and increased stage 1 sleep. Periodic limb movements (found in about\n40% of individuals with narcolepsy) and sleep apnea are often noted.\nHypocretin deficiency is demonstrated by measuring CSF hypocretin-1 immunoreac-\ntivity. The test is particularly useful in individuals with suspected conversion disorder\nand those without typical cataplexy, or in treatment-refractory cases. The diagnostic value\nof the test is not affected by medications, sleep deprivation, or circadian time, but the find-\nings are uninterpretable when the individual is severely ill with a concurrent infection or\nhead trauma or is comatose. CSF cytology, protein, and glucose are within normal range\neven when sampled within weeks of rapid onset. CSF hypocretin-1 in these incipient cases\nis typically already very diminished or undetectable.Polysomnography provides quantitative data on frequency of sleep-related respiratory\ndisturbances and associated changes in oxygen saturation and sleep continuity. Polysom-\nnographic findings in children differ from those in adults in that children demonstrate\nlabored breathing, partial obstructive hypoventilation with cyclical desaturations, hyper-\ncapnia and paradoxical movements. Apnea hypopnea index levels as low as 2 are used to\ndefine thresholds of abnormality in children.\nArterial blood gas measurements while the individual is awake are usually normal, but\nsome individuals can have waking hypoxemia or hypercapnia. This pattern should alert the\nclinician to the possibility of coexisting lung disease or hypoventilation. Imaging procedures\nmay reveal narrowing of the upper airway. Cardiac testing may show evidence of impaired\nventricular function. Individuals with severe nocturnal oxygen desaturation may also have el-\nevated hemoglobin or hematocrit values. Validated sleep measures (e.g., multiple sleep la-\ntency test [MSLT], maintenance of wakefulness test) may identify sleepiness.Physical findings seen in individuals with a Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern relate to its\nrisk factors. Findings consistent with heart failure, such as jugular venous distension, S3\nheart sound, lung crackles, and lower extremity edema, may be present. Polysomnogra-\nphy is used to characterize the breathing characteristics of each breathing-related sleep\ndisorder subtype. Central sleep apneas are recorded when periods of breathing cessation\nfor longer than 10 seconds occur. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is characterized by a pattern of\nperiodic crescendo-decrescendo variation in tidal volume that results in central apneas\nand hypopneas occurring at a frequency of at least five events per hour that are accompa-\nnied by frequent arousals. The cycle length of Cheyne-Stokes breathing (or time from end\nof one central apnea to the end of the next apnea) is about 60 seconds.\n386\nSleep-Wake DisordersSleep-related hypoventilation is diagnosed using polysomnography showing sleep-related\nhypoxemia and hypercapnia that is not better explained by another breathing-related sleep\ndisorder. The documentation of increased arterial pCO2 levels to greater than 55 mmHg\nduring sleep or a 10 mmHg or greater increase in pCO2 levels (to a level that also exceeds\n50 mmHg) during sleep in comparison to awake supine values, for 10 minutes or longer, is\nthe gold standard for diagnosis. However, obtaining arterial blood gas determinations dur-\ning sleep is impractical, and non-invasive measures of pCO2 have not been adequately val-\nidated during sleep and are not widely used during polysomnography in adults. Prolonged\nand sustained decreases in oxygen saturation (oxygen saturation of less than 90% for more\nthan 5 minutes with a nadir of at least 85%, or oxygen saturation of less than 90% for at least\n30% of sleep time) in the absence of evidence of upper airway obstruction are often used as\nan indication of sleep-related hypoventilation; however, this finding is not specific, as there\nare other potential causes of hypoxemia, such as that due to lung disease.Confirmation of the diagnosis includes a complete history and use of a sleep diary or actigra-\nphy (i.e., a wrist-worn motion detector that monitors motor activity for prolonged periods and\ncan be used as a proxy for sleep-wake patterns for at least 7 days). The period covered should\ninclude weekends, when social and occupational obligations are less strict, to ensure that the\nindividual exhibits a consistently delayed sleep-wake pattern. Biomarkers such as salivary\ndim light melatonin onset should be obtained only when the diagnosis is unclear.A sleep diary and actigraphy may be used as diagnostic markers, as described earlier for\ndelayed sleep phase type.A detailed sleep history and a sleep diary (by a caregiver) or actigraphy help confirm the\nirregular sleep-wake pattern.Diagnosis is confirmed by history and sleep diary or actigraphy for an extended period.\nSequential measurement of phase markers (e.g., melatonin) can help determine circadian\nphase in both sighted and blind individuals.A history and sleep diary or actigraphy may be useful in diagnosis, as discussed earlier for\ndelayed sleep phase type.", "suicide_risk": "", "functional_consequences": "The low level of alertness that occurs while an individual fights the need for sleep can lead\nto reduced efficiency, diminished concentration, and poor memory during daytime activ-\nities. Hypersomnolence can lead to significant distress and dysfunction in work and social\nrelationships. Prolonged nocturnal sleep and difficulty awakening can result in difficulty\nin meeting morning obligations, such as arriving at work on time. Unintentional daytime\nsleep episodes can be embarrassing and even dangerous, if, for instance, the individual is\ndriving or operating machinery when the episode occurs.Driving and working are impaired, and individuals with narcolepsy should avoid jobs\nthat place themselves (e.g., working with machinery) or others (e.g., bus driver, pilot) in\ndanger. Once the narcolepsy is controlled with therapy, patients can usually drive, al-\nthough rarely long distances alone. Untreated individuals are also at risk for social isola-\ntion and accidental injury to themselves or others. Social relations may suffer as these\nindividuals strive to avert cataplexy by exerting control over emotions.Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea\nMore than 50% of individuals with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea\nreport symptoms of daytime sleepiness. A twofold increased risk of occupational accidents\nhas been reported in association with symptoms of snoring and sleepiness. Motor vehicle\ncrashes also have been reported to be as much as sevenfold higher among individuals with\nelevated apnea hypopnea index values. Clinicians should be cognizant of state govern-\nment requirements for reporting this disorder, especially in relationship to commercial\ndrivers. Reduced scores on measures of health-related quality of life are common in individ-\nuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, with the largest decrements observed in the\nphysical and vitality subscales.Idiopathic central sleep apnea has been reported to cause symptoms of disrupted sleep, in-\ncluding insomnia and sleepiness. Cheyne-Stokes breathing with comorbid heart failure\nhas been associated with excessive sleepiness, fatigue, and insomnia, although many in-\ndividuals may be asymptomatic. Coexistence of heart failure and Cheyne-Stokes breath-\ning may be associated with increased cardiac arrhythmias and increased mortality or\ncardiac transplantation. Individuals with central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use\nmay present with symptoms of sleepiness or insomnia.Sleep-Related Hypoventilation\nThe consequences of sleep-related hypoventilation are related to the effects of chronic ex-\nposure to hypercapnia and hypoxemia. These blood gas derangements cause vasocon-\nstriction of the pulmonary vasculature leading to pulmonary hypertension, which, if\nsevere, can result in right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale). Hypoxemia can lead to dys-\nfunction of organs such as the brain, blood, and heart, leading to outcomes such as cog-\nnitive dysfunction, polycythemia, and cardiac arrhythmias. Hypercapnia can depress\nventilatory drive, leading to progressive respiratory failure.Excessive early day sleepiness is prominent. Extreme and prolonged difficulty awakening\nwith morning confusion (i.e., sleep inertia) is also common. The severity of insomnia and\nexcessive sleepiness symptoms varies substantially among individuals and largely de-\npends on the occupational and social demands on the individual.Excessive sleepiness associated with advanced sleep phase can have a negative effect on\ncognitive performance, social interaction, and safety. Use of wake-promoting agents to\ncombat sleepiness or sedatives for early morning awakening may increase potential for\nsubstance abuse.Irregular Sleep-Wake Type\nLack of a clearly discernible major sleep and wake period in irregular sleep-wake type re-\nsults in insomnia or excessive sleepiness, depending on the time of day. Disruption of the\ncaregiver’s sleep also often occurs and is an important consideration.Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Type\nComplaints of insomnia (sleep onset and sleep maintenance), excessive sleepiness, or both\nare prominent. The unpredictability of sleep and wake times (typically a daily delay drift)\nresults in an inability to attend school or maintain a steady job and may increase potential\nfor social isolation.Individuals with shift work type not only may perform poorly at work but also appear to\nbe at risk for accidents both at work and on the drive home. They may also be at risk for\npoor mental health (e.g., alcohol use disorder, substance use disorder, depression) and\nphysical health (e.g., gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer).\nIndividuals with a history of bipolar disorder are particularly vulnerable to shift work\ntype–related episodes of mania resulting from missed nights of sleep. Shift work type of-\nten results in interpersonal problems.", "differential_diagnosis": "Normative variation in sleep.\n“Normal” sleep duration varies considerably in the general\npopulation. “Long sleepers” (i.e., individuals who require a greater than average amount\nof sleep) do not have excessive sleepiness, sleep inertia, or automatic behavior when they\nobtain their required amount of nocturnal sleep. Sleep is reported to be refreshing. If social\nor occupational demands lead to shorter nocturnal sleep, daytime symptoms may appear.\nIn hypersomnolence disorder, by contrast, symptoms of excessive sleepiness occur regard-\nless of nocturnal sleep duration. An inadequate amount of nocturnal sleep, or behaviorally\ninduced insufficient sleep syndrome, can produce symptoms of daytime sleepiness very similar\nto those of hypersomnolence. An average sleep duration of fewer than 7 hours per night\nstrongly suggests inadequate nocturnal sleep, and an average of more than 9–10 hours of\nsleep per 24-hour period suggests hypersomnolence. Individuals with inadequate noctur-\nnal sleep typically “catch up” with longer sleep durations on days when they are free from\nsocial or occupational demands or on vacations. Unlike hypersomnolence, insufficient\nnocturnal sleep is unlikely to persist unabated for decades. A diagnosis of hypersomno-\nlence disorder should not be made if there is a question regarding the adequacy of noctur-\nnal sleep duration. A diagnostic and therapeutic trial of sleep extension for 10–14 days can\noften clarify the diagnosis.\nPoor sleep quality and fatigue.\nHypersomnolence disorder should be distinguished\nfrom excessive sleepiness related to insufficient sleep quantity or quality and fatigue (i.e.,\ntiredness not necessarily relieved by increased sleep and unrelated to sleep quantity or\nquality). Excessive sleepiness and fatigue are difficult to differentiate and may overlap\nconsiderably.\nBreathing-related sleep disorders.\nIndividuals with hypersomnolence and breathing-\nrelated sleep disorders may have similar patterns of excessive sleepiness. Breathing-\n372\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nrelated sleep disorders are suggested by a history of loud snoring, pauses in breathing\nduring sleep, brain injury, or cardiovascular disease and by the presence of obesity, oro-\npharyngeal anatomical abnormalities, hypertension, or heart failure on physical examina-\ntion. Polysomnographic studies can confirm the presence of apneic events in breathing-\nrelated sleep disorder (and their absence in hypersomnolence disorder).\nCircadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders.\nCircadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders are\noften characterized by daytime sleepiness. A history of an abnormal sleep-wake schedule\n(with shifted or irregular hours) is present in individuals with a circadian rhythm sleep-\nwake disorder.\nParasomnias.\nParasomnias rarely produce the prolonged, undisturbed nocturnal sleep\nor daytime sleepiness characteristic of hypersomnolence disorder.\nOther mental disorders.\nHypersomnolence disorder must be distinguished from mental\ndisorders that include hypersomnolence as an essential or associated feature. In particular,\ncomplaints of daytime sleepiness may occur in a major depressive episode, with atypical fea-\ntures, and in the depressed phase of bipolar disorder. Assessment for other mental disorders is\nessential before a diagnosis of hypersomnolence disorder is considered. A diagnosis of hyper-\nsomnolence disorder can be made in the presence of another current or past mental disorder.Other hypersomnias.\nHypersomnolence and narcolepsy are similar with respect to the\ndegree of daytime sleepiness, age at onset, and stable course over time but can be distin-\nNarcolepsy\n377\nguished based on distinctive clinical and laboratory features. Individuals with hypersom-\nnolence typically have longer and less disrupted nocturnal sleep, greater difficulty\nawakening, more persistent daytime sleepiness (as opposed to more discrete “sleep at-\ntacks” in narcolepsy), longer and less refreshing daytime sleep episodes, and little or no\ndreaming during daytime naps. By contrast, individuals with narcolepsy have cataplexy\nand recurrent intrusions of elements of REM sleep into the transition between sleep and\nwakefulness (e.g., sleep-related hallucinations and sleep paralysis). The MSLT typically\ndemonstrates shorter sleep latencies (i.e., greater physiological sleepiness) as well as the\npresence of multiple sleep-onset REM periods in individuals with narcolepsy.\nSleep deprivation and insufficient nocturnal sleep.\nSleep deprivation and insufficient\nnocturnal sleep are common in adolescents and shift workers. In adolescents, difficulties\nfalling asleep at night are common, causing sleep deprivation. The MSLT result may be\npositive if conducted while the individual is sleep deprived or while his or her sleep is\nphase delayed.\nSleep apnea syndromes.\nSleep apneas are especially likely in the presence of obesity.\nBecause obstructive sleep apnea is more frequent than narcolepsy, cataplexy may be over-\nlooked (or absent), and the individual is assumed to have obstructive sleep apnea unre-\nsponsive to usual therapies.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nNarcolepsy or hypersomnia may be associated or confused\nwith depression. Cataplexy is not present in depression. The MSLT results are most often\nnormal, and there is dissociation between subjective and objective sleepiness, as measured\nby the mean sleep latency during the MSLT.\nConversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).\nAtypical features,\nsuch as long-lasting cataplexy or unusual triggers, may be present in conversion disorder\n(functional neurological symptom disorder). Individuals may report sleeping and dream-\ning, yet the MSLT does not show the characteristic sleep-onset REM period. Full-blown,\nlong-lasting pseudocataplexy may occur during consultation, allowing the examining\nphysician enough time to verify reflexes, which remain intact.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or other behavioral problems.\nIn children and\nadolescents, sleepiness can cause behavioral problems, including aggressiveness and in-\nattention, leading to a misdiagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nSeizures.\nIn young children, cataplexy can be misdiagnosed as seizures. Seizures are not\ncommonly triggered by emotions, and when they are, the trigger is not usually laughing or\njoking. During a seizure, individuals are more likely to hurt themselves when falling. Sei-\nzures characterized by isolated atonia are rarely seen in isolation of other seizures, and\nthey also have signatures on the electroencephalogram.\nChorea and movement disorders.\nIn young children, cataplexy can be misdiagnosed as\nchorea or pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal\ninfections, especially in the context of a strep throat infection and high antistreptolysin O\nantibody levels. Some children may have an overlapping movement disorder close to on-\nset of the cataplexy.\nSchizophrenia.\nIn the presence of florid and vivid hypnagogic hallucinations, individuals\nmay think these experiences are real—a feature that suggests schizophrenia. Similarly,\nwith stimulant treatment, persecutory delusions may develop. If cataplexy is present, the\nclinician should first assume that these symptoms are secondary to narcolepsy before con-\nsidering a co-occurring diagnosis of schizophrenia.Primary snoring and other sleep disorders.\nIndividuals with obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea must be differentiated from individuals with primary snoring (i.e., otherwise\n382\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nasymptomatic individuals who snore and do not have abnormalities on overnight polysom-\nnography). Individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea may additionally report\nnocturnal gasping and choking. The presence of sleepiness or other daytime symptoms\nnot explained by other etiologies suggests the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea hypop-\nnea, but this differentiation requires polysomnography. Definitive differential diagnosis\nbetween hypersomnia, central sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoventilation, and obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea also requires polysomnographic studies.\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea must be differentiated from other causes of sleepi-\nness, such as narcolepsy, hypersomnia, and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea can be differentiated from narcolepsy by the absence of cataplexy,\nsleep-related hallucinations, and sleep paralysis and by the presence of loud snoring,\ngasping during sleep, or observed apneas in sleep. Daytime sleep episodes in narcolepsy\nare characteristically shorter, more refreshing, and more often associated with dreaming.\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea shows characteristic apneas and hypopneas and oxy-\ngen desaturation during nocturnal polysomnographic studies. Narcolepsy results in mul-\ntiple sleep-onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods during the MSLT. Narcolepsy, like\nobstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, may be associated with obesity, and some individuals\nhave concurrent narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. A diagnosis of narco-\nlepsy does not exclude the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, as the two con-\nditions may co-occur.\nInsomnia disorder.\nFor individuals complaining of difficulty initiating or maintaining\nsleep or early-morning awakenings, insomnia disorder can be differentiated from obstruc-\ntive sleep apnea hypopnea by the absence of snoring and the absence of the history, signs,\nand symptoms characteristic of the latter disorder. However, insomnia and obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea may coexist, and if so, both disorders may need to be addressed\nconcurrently to improve sleep.\nPanic attacks.\nNocturnal panic attacks may include symptoms of gasping or choking\nduring sleep that may be difficult to distinguish clinically from obstructive sleep apnea hy-\npopnea. However, the lower frequency of episodes, intense autonomic arousal, and lack of\nexcessive sleepiness differentiate nocturnal panic attacks from obstructive sleep apnea hy-\npopnea. Polysomnography in individuals with nocturnal panic attacks does not reveal the\ntypical pattern of apneas or oxygen desaturation characteristic of obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea. Individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea do not provide a history of\ndaytime panic attacks.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in chil-\ndren may include symptoms of inattention, academic impairment, hyperactivity, and in-\nternalizing behaviors, all of which may also be symptoms of childhood obstructive sleep\napnea hypopnea. The presence of other symptoms and signs of childhood obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea (e.g., labored breathing or snoring during sleep and adenotonsillar\nhypertrophy) would suggest the presence of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Obstruc-\ntive sleep apnea hypopnea and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may commonly\nco-occur, and there may be causal links between them; therefore, risk factors such as en-\nlarged tonsils, obesity, or a family history of sleep apnea may help alert the clinician to\ntheir co-occurrence.\nSubstance/medication-induced insomnia or hypersomnia.\nSubstance use and substance\nwithdrawal (including medications) can produce insomnia or hypersomnia. A careful his-\ntory is usually sufficient to identify the relevant substance/medication, and follow-up\nshows improvement of the sleep disturbance after discontinuation of the substance/med-\nication. In other cases, the use of a substance/medication (e.g., alcohol, barbiturates, ben-\nzodiazepines, tobacco) has been shown to exacerbate obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea.\nAn individual with symptoms and signs consistent with obstructive sleep apnea hypop-\nCentral Sleep Apnea\n383\nnea should receive that diagnosis, even in the presence of concurrent substance use that is\nexacerbating the condition.Idiopathic central sleep apnea must be distinguished from other breathing-related sleep\ndisorders, other sleep disorders, and medical conditions and mental disorders that cause\nsleep fragmentation, sleepiness, and fatigue. This is achieved using polysomnography.\nOther breathing-related sleep disorders and sleep disorders.\nCentral sleep apnea can\nbe distinguished from obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea by the presence of at least five\ncentral apneas per hour of sleep. These conditions may co-occur, but central sleep apnea is\nconsidered to predominate when the ratio of central to obstructive respiratory events ex-\nceeds 50%.\nCheyne-Stokes breathing can be distinguished from other mental disorders, including\nother sleep disorders, and other medical conditions that cause sleep fragmentation, sleep-\niness, and fatigue based on the presence of a predisposing condition (e.g., heart failure or\nstroke) and signs and polysomnographic evidence of the characteristic breathing pattern.\nPolysomnographic respiratory findings can help distinguish Cheyne-Stokes breathing\nfrom insomnia due to other medical conditions. High-altitude periodic breathing has a\npattern that resembles Cheyne-Stokes breathing but has a shorter cycle time, occurs only\nat high altitude, and is not associated with heart failure.\nCentral sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use can be differentiated from other types of\nbreathing-related sleep disorders based on the use of long-acting opioid medications in\nconjunction with polysomnographic evidence of central apneas and periodic or ataxic\nbreathing. It can be distinguished from insomnia due to drug or substance use based on\npolysomnographic evidence of central sleep apnea.Other medical conditions affecting ventilation.\nIn adults, the idiopathic variety of sleep-\nrelated hypoventilation is very uncommon and is determined by excluding the presence of\nlung diseases, skeletal malformations, neuromuscular disorders, and other medical and\nneurological disorders or medications that affect ventilation. Sleep-related hypoventila-\ntion must be distinguished from other causes of sleep-related hypoxemia, such as that due\nto lung disease.\nOther breathing-related sleep disorders.\nSleep-related hypoventilation can be distin-\nguished from obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and central sleep apnea based on clinical\nfeatures and findings on polysomnography. Sleep-related hypoventilation typically shows\nmore sustained periods of oxygen desaturation rather that the periodic episodes seen in\nobstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and central sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea hy-\npopnea and central sleep apnea also show a pattern of discrete episodes of repeated air-\nflow decreases that can be absent in sleep-related hypoventilation.Normative variations in sleep.\nDelayed sleep phase type must be distinguished from\n“normal” sleep patterns in which an individual has a late schedule that does not cause\npersonal, social, or occupational distress (most commonly seen in adolescents and young\nadults).\nOther sleep disorders.\nInsomnia disorder and other circadian rhythm sleep-wake dis-\norders should be included in the differential. Excessive sleepiness may also be caused by\nother sleep disturbances, such as breathing-related sleep disorders, insomnias, sleep-\nrelated movement disorders, and medical, neurological, and mental disorders. Overnight\npolysomnography may help in evaluating for other comorbid sleep disorders, such as\nsleep apnea. The circadian nature of delayed sleep phase type, however, should differen-\ntiate it from other disorders with similar complaints.Other sleep disorders.\nBehavioral factors such as irregular sleep schedules, voluntary\nearly awakening, and exposure to light in the early morning should be considered, partic-\nularly in older adults. Careful attention should be paid to rule out other sleep-wake dis-\norders, such as insomnia disorder, and other mental disorders and medical conditions that\ncan cause early morning awakening.\nDepressive and bipolar disorders.\nBecause early morning awakening, fatigue, and sleep-\niness are prominent features of major depressive disorder, depressive and bipolar disor-\nders must also be considered.Normative variations in sleep.\nIrregular sleep-wake type should be distinguished from\na voluntary irregular sleep-wake schedule and poor sleep hygiene, which can result in in-\nsomnia and excessive sleepiness.\nOther medical conditions and mental disorders.\nOther causes of insomnia and daytime\nsleepiness, including comorbid medical conditions and mental disorders or medication,\nshould be considered.\n396\nSleep-Wake DisordersCircadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders.\nIn sighted individuals, non-24-hour sleep-wake\ntype should be differentiated from delayed sleep phase type, as individuals with delayed\nsleep phase type may display a similar progressive delay in sleep period for several days.\nDepressive disorders.\nDepressive symptoms and depressive disorders may result in\nsimilar circadian dysregulation and symptoms.Normative variations in sleep with shift work.\nThe diagnosis of shift work type, as op-\nposed to the “normal” difficulties of shift work, must depend to some extent on the sever-\nity of symptoms and/or level of distress experienced by the individual. Presence of shift\nwork type symptoms even when the individual is able to live on a day-oriented routine for\nseveral weeks at a time may suggest the presence of other sleep disorders, such as sleep ap-\nnea, insomnia, and narcolepsy, which should be ruled out.", "comorbidity": "Insomnia is a common comorbidity of many medical conditions, including diabetes, cor-\nonary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arthritis, fibromyalgia, and\nother chronic pain conditions. The risk relationship appears to be bidirectional: insomnia\nincreases the risk of medical conditions, and medical problems increase the risk of insom-\nnia. The direction of the relationship is not always clear and may change over time; for this\nreason, comorbid insomnia is the preferred terminology in the presence of coexisting in-\nsomnia with another medical condition (or mental disorder).\nIndividuals with insomnia disorder frequently have a comorbid mental disorder, par-\nticularly bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders. Persistent insomnia represents a risk\nfactor or an early symptom of subsequent bipolar, depressive, anxiety, and substance use\ndisorders. Individuals with insomnia may misuse medications or alcohol to help with\nnighttime sleep, anxiolytics to combat tension or anxiety, and caffeine or other stimulants\nto combat excessive fatigue. In addition to worsening the insomnia, this type of substance\nuse may in some cases progress to a substance use disorder.\nRelationship to International Classification of\nSleep Disorders\nThere are several distinct insomnia phenotypes relating to the perceived source of the in-\nsomnia that are recognized by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition\n(ICSD-2). These include psychophysiological insomnia, idiopathic insomnia, sleep-state mispercep-\ntion, and inadequate sleep hygiene. Despite their clinical appeal and heuristic value, there is\nlimited evidence to support these distinct phenotypes.\nHypersomnolence DisorderHypersomnolence can be associated with depressive disorders, bipolar disorders (during a\ndepressive episode), and major depressive disorder, with seasonal pattern. Many individu-\nals with hypersomnolence disorder have symptoms of depression that may meet criteria for\na depressive disorder. This presentation may be related to the psychosocial consequences of\npersistent increased sleep need. Individuals with hypersomnolence disorder are also at\nrisk for substance-related disorders, particularly related to self-medication with stimulants.\nThis general lack of specificity may contribute to very heterogeneous profiles among indi-\nviduals whose symptoms meet the same diagnostic criteria for hypersomnolence disorder.\nNeurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and mul-\ntiple system atrophy, may also be associated with hypersomnolence.\nRelationship to International Classification of\nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), differentiates nineNarcolepsy can co-occur with bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders, and in rare cases\nwith schizophrenia. Narcolepsy is also associated with increased body mass index or obe-\n378\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nsity, especially when the narcolepsy is untreated. Rapid weight gain is common in young\nchildren with a sudden disease onset. Comorbid sleep apnea should be considered if there\nis a sudden aggravation of preexisting narcolepsy.\nRelationship to International Classification of\nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), differentiates fiveSystemic hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, diabetes, and increased\nmortality are consistently associated with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Risk esti-\nmates vary from 30% to as much as 300% for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea. Evidence of pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure (e.g., cor pulmo-\nnale, ankle edema, hepatic congestion) are rare in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and\nwhen present indicate either very severe disease or associated hypoventilation or cardio-\npulmonary comorbidities. Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea also may occur with in-\ncreased frequency in association with a number of medical or neurological conditions (e.g.,\ncerebrovascular disease, Parkinson’s disease). Physical findings reflect the co-occurrence of\nthese conditions.\nAs many as one-third of individuals referred for evaluation of obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea report symptoms of depression, with as many of 10% having depression scores\nconsistent with moderate to severe depression. Severity of obstructive sleep apnea hypop-\nnea, as measured by the apnea hypopnea index, has been found to be correlated with se-\nverity of symptoms of depression. This association may be stronger in males than in\nfemales.\nRelationship to International Classification of\nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), differentiates 11 sub-\ntypes of “sleep-related breathing disorders,” including primary central sleep apnea, ob-\nstructive sleep apnea, and sleep-related hypoventilation.\nCentral Sleep ApneaCentral sleep apnea disorders are frequently present in users of long-acting opioids, such\nas methadone. Individuals taking these medications have a sleep-related breathing disor-\nder that could contribute to sleep disturbances and symptoms such as sleepiness, confu-\nsion, and depression. While the individual is asleep, breathing patterns such as central\napneas, periodic apneas, and ataxic breathing may be observed. Obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea may coexist with central sleep apnea, and features consistent with this condi-\ntion can also be present (see “Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea” earlier in this chapter).\nCheyne-Stokes breathing is more commonly observed in association with conditions that\ninclude heart failure, stroke, and renal failure and is seen more frequently in individuals\nwith atrial fibrillation. Individuals with Cheyne-Stokes breathing are more likely to be\nolder, to be male, and to have lower weight than individuals with obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea.\nSleep-Related Hypoventilation\n387\nSleep-Related HypoventilationSleep-related hypoventilation often occurs in association with a pulmonary disorder (e.g., in-\nterstitial lung disease, COPD), with a neuromuscular or chest wall disorder (e.g., muscular\ndystrophies, post-polio syndrome, cervical spinal cord injury, obesity, kyphoscoliosis), or,\n390\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nmost relevant to the mental health provider, with medication use (e.g., benzodiazepines, opi-\nates). Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation often occurs in association with autonomic\ndysfunction and may occur in association with Hirschsprung’s disease. COPD, a disorder of\nlower airway obstruction usually associated with cigarette smoking, can result in sleep-\nrelated hypoventilation and hypoxemia. The presence of coexisting obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea is thought to exacerbate hypoxemia and hypercapnia during sleep and wakeful-\nness. The relationship between congenital central alveolar hypoventilation and idiopathic\nsleep-related hypoventilation is unclear; in some individuals, idiopathic sleep-related hy-\npoventilation may represent cases of late-onset congenital central alveolar hypoventilation.\nRelationship to International Classification of\nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), combines sleep-\nrelated hypoventilation and sleep-related hypoxemia under the category of sleep-related\nhypoventilation/hypoxemic syndromes. This approach to classification reflects the fre-\nquent co-occurrence of disorders that lead to hypoventilation and hypoxemia. In contrast,\nthe classification used in DSM-5 reflects evidence that there are distinct sleep-related\npathogenetic processes leading to hypoventilation.\nCircadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake DisordersDelayed sleep phase type is strongly associated with depression, personality disorder, and\nsomatic symptom disorder or illness anxiety disorder. In addition, comorbid sleep disor-\nders, such as insomnia disorder, restless legs syndrome, and sleep apnea, as well as depres-\nsive and bipolar disorders and anxiety disorders, can exacerbate symptoms of insomnia\nand excessive sleepiness. Delayed sleep phase type may overlap with another circadian\nrhythm sleep-wake disorder, non-24-hour sleep-wake type. Sighted individuals with non-\n24-hour sleep-wake type disorder commonly also have a history of delayed circadian sleep\nphase.\nCircadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders\n393\nAdvanced Sleep Phase TypeMedical conditions and mental disorders with the symptom of early morning awakening,\nsuch as insomnia, can co-occur with the advance sleep phase type.\nIrregular Sleep-Wake TypeIrregular sleep-wake type is often comorbid with neurodegenerative and neurodevelop-\nmental disorders, such as major neurocognitive disorder, intellectual disability (intellec-\ntual developmental disorder), and traumatic brain injury. It is also comorbid with other\nmedical conditions and mental disorders in which there is social isolation and/or lack of\nlight and structured activities.\nNon-24-Hour Sleep-Wake TypeBlindness is often comorbid with non-24-hour sleep-wake type, as are depressive and bi-\npolar disorders with social isolation.\nShift Work TypeShift work type has been associated with increased alcohol use disorder, other substance\nuse disorders, and depression. A variety of physical health disorders (e.g., gastrointestinal\ndisorders, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer) have been found to be associated with\nprolonged exposure to shift work.\nRelationship to International Classification of\nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), differentiates nine\ncircadian rhythm sleep disorders, including jet lag type.\nNon–Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal Disorders\n399\nParasomnias\nParasomnias are disorders characterized by abnormal behavioral, experiential, or physio-\nlogical events occurring in association with sleep, specific sleep stages, or sleep-wake tran-\nsitions.

Episodes may begin with\nconfusion: the individual may simply sit up in bed, look about, or pick at the blanket or\nsheet. This behavior then becomes progressively complex. The individual may actually\nleave the bed and walk into closets, out of the room, and even out of buildings. Individuals\nmay use the bathroom, eat, talk, or engage in more complex behaviors. Running and fran-\ntic attempts to escape some apparent threat can also occur. Most behaviors during sleep-\nwalking episodes are routine and of low complexity. However, cases of unlocking doors\nand even operating machinery (driving an automobile) have been reported. Sleepwalking\ncan also include inappropriate behavior (e.g., commonly, urinating in a closet or waste-\nbasket). Most episodes last for several minutes to a half hour but may be more protracted.\nInasmuch as sleep is a state of relative analgesia, painful injuries sustained during sleep-\nwalking may not be appreciated until awakening after the fact.\nThere are two “specialized” forms of sleepwalking: sleep-related eating behavior and\nsleep-related sexual behavior (sexsomnia or sleep sex). Individuals with sleep-related eating\nexperience unwanted recurrent episodes of eating with varying degrees of amnesia, rang-\ning from no awareness to full awareness without the ability to not eat. During these epi-\nsodes, inappropriate foods may be ingested. Individuals with sleep-related eating disorder\nmay find evidence of their eating only the next morning. In sexsomnia, varying degrees of\nNon–Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal Disorders\n401\nsexual activity (e.g., masturbation, fondling, groping, sexual intercourse) occur as complex\nbehaviors arising from sleep without conscious awareness. This condition is more common\nin males and may result in serious interpersonal relationship problems or medicolegal\nconsequences.\nDuring a typical episode of sleep terrors, there is often a sense of overwhelming dread,\nwith a compulsion to escape.

Uncommonly, NREM sleep arousal disorders may result in serious injury to the\nindividual or to someone trying to console the individual. Injuries to others are confined to\nthose in close proximity; individuals are not “sought out.” Typically, sleepwalking in both\nchildren and adults is not associated with significant mental disorders. For individuals\nwith sleep-related eating behaviors, unknowingly preparing or eating food during the\nsleep period may create problems such as poor diabetes control, weight gain, injury (cuts\nand burns), or consequences of eating dangerous or toxic inedibles.

The\ndream disturbance of REM sleep behavior disorder is described by patients as nightmares\nbut is controlled by appropriate medication.\nBereavement.\nDysphoric dreams may occur during bereavement but typically involve\nloss and sadness and are followed by self-reflection and insight, rather than distress, on\nawakening.\nNarcolepsy.\nNightmares are a frequent complaint in narcolepsy, but the presence of ex-\ncessive sleepiness and cataplexy differentiates this condition from nightmare disorder.\nNocturnal seizures.\nSeizures may rarely manifest as nightmares and should be evalu-\nated with polysomnography and continuous video electroencephalography. Nocturnal\nseizures usually involve stereotypical motor activity. Associated nightmares, if recalled,\nRapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder\n407\nare often repetitive in nature or reflect epileptogenic features such as the content of diurnal\nauras (e.g., unmotivated dread), phosphenes, or ictal imagery. Disorders of arousal, espe-\ncially confusional arousals, may also be present.\nBreathing-related sleep disorders.\nBreathing-related sleep disorders can lead to awaken-\nings with autonomic arousal, but these are not usually accompanied by recall of nightmares.\nPanic disorder.\nAttacks arising during sleep can produce abrupt awakenings with au-\ntonomic arousal and fearfulness, but nightmares are typically not reported and symptoms\nare similar to panic attacks arising during wakefulness.\nSleep-related dissociative disorders.\nIndividuals may recall actual physical or emo-\ntional trauma as a “dream” during electroencephalography-documented awakenings.\nMedication or substance use.\nNumerous substances/medications can precipitate night-\nmares, including dopaminergics; beta-adrenergic antagonists and other antihypertensives;\namphetamine, cocaine, and other stimulants; antidepressants; smoking cessation aids;\nand melatonin. Withdrawal of REM sleep–suppressant medications (e.g., antidepressants)\nand alcohol can produce REM sleep rebound accompanied by nightmares.

Some medications that invoke sleep disturbances include adrenergic agonists\nand antagonists, dopamine agonists and antagonists, cholinergic agonists and antagonists,\nserotonergic agonists and antagonists, antihistamines, and corticosteroids.\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder\n417\nAlcohol.\nAlcohol-induced sleep disorder typically occurs as insomnia type. During\nacute intoxication, alcohol produces an immediate sedative effect depending on dose, ac-\ncompanied by increased stages 3 and 4 non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and re-\nduced rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Following these initial effects, there may be\nincreased wakefulness, restless sleep, and vivid and anxiety-laden dreams for the remain-\ning sleep period. In parallel, stages 3 and 4 sleep are reduced, and wakefulness and REM\nsleep are increased. Alcohol can aggravate breathing-related sleep disorder. With habitual\nuse, alcohol continues to show a short-lived sedative effect in the first half of the night, fol-\nlowed by sleep continuity disruption in the second half. During alcohol withdrawal, there\nis extremely disrupted sleep continuity, and an increased amount and intensity of REM\nsleep, associated frequently with vivid dreaming, which in extreme form, constitutes part\nof alcohol withdrawal delirium. After acute withdrawal, chronic alcohol users may con-\ntinue to complain of light, fragmented sleep for weeks to years associated with a persistent\ndeficit in slow-wave sleep.\nCaffeine.\nCaffeine-induced sleep disorder produces insomnia in a dose-dependent man-\nner, with some individuals presenting with daytime sleepiness related to withdrawal.\nCannabis.\nAcute administration of cannabis may shorten sleep latency, though arous-\ning effects with increments in sleep latency also occur. Cannabis enhances slow-wave\nsleep and suppresses REM sleep after acute administration. In chronic users, tolerance to\nthe sleep-inducing and slow-wave sleep–enhancing effects develops. Upon withdrawal,\nsleep difficulties and unpleasant dreams have been reported lasting for several weeks.\nPolysomnography studies demonstrate reduced slow-wave sleep and increased REM sleep\nduring this phase.\nOpioids.\nOpioids may produce an increase in sleepiness and in subjective depth of sleep,\nand reduced REM sleep, during acute short-term use. With continued administration, tol-\nerance to the sedative effects of opioids develops and there are complaints of insomnia.\nConsistent with their respiratory depressant effects, opioids exacerbate sleep apnea.\nSedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances.\nSedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics (e.g.,\nbarbiturates, benzodiazepines receptor agonists, meprobamate, glutethimide, methypry-\nlon) have similar effects as opioids on sleep. During acute intoxication, sedative-hypnotic\ndrugs produce the expected increase in sleepiness and decrease in wakefulness. Chronic\nuse (particularly of barbiturates and the older nonbarbiturate, nonbenzodiazepine drugs)\nmay cause tolerance with subsequent return of insomnia. Daytime sleepiness may occur.\nSedative-hypnotic drugs can increase the frequency and severity of obstructive sleep ap-\nnea events. Parasomnias are associated with use of benzodiazepine receptor agonists, es-\npecially when these medications are taken at higher doses and when they are combined\nwith other sedative drugs. Abrupt discontinuation of chronic sedative, hypnotic, or anx-\niolytic use can lead to withdrawal but more commonly rebound insomnia, a condition of\nan exacerbation of insomnia upon drug discontinuation for 1–2 days reported to occur\neven with short-term use. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drugs with short durations of\naction are most likely to produce complaints of rebound insomnia, whereas those with\nlonger durations of action are more often associated with daytime sleepiness. Any sedative,\nhypnotic, or anxiolytic drug can potentially cause daytime sedation, withdrawal, or re-\nbound insomnia.\nAmphetamines and related substances and other stimulants.\nSleep disorders induced\nby amphetamine and related substances and other stimulants are characterized by insomnia\nduring intoxication and excessive sleepiness during withdrawal. During acute intoxication,\nstimulants reduce the total amount of sleep, increase sleep latency and sleep continuity distur-\nbances, and decrease REM sleep. Slow-wave sleep tends to be reduced. During withdrawal\nfrom chronic stimulant use, there is both prolonged nocturnal sleep duration and excessive\ndaytime sleepiness. Multiple sleep latency tests may show increased daytime sleepiness dur-\n418\nSleep-Wake Disorders\ning the withdrawal phase. Drugs like 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; “ec-\nstasy”) and related substances lead to restless and disturbed sleep within 48 hours of intake;\nfrequent use of these compounds is associated with persisting symptoms of anxiety, depres-\nsion, and sleep disturbances, even during longer-term abstinence.\nTobacco.\nChronic tobacco consumption is associated primarily with symptoms of insom-\nnia, decreased slow-wave sleep with a reduction of sleep efficiency, and increased daytime\nsleepiness. Withdrawal from tobacco can lead to impaired sleep. Individuals who smoke\nheavily may experience regular nocturnal awakenings caused by tobacco craving.\nOther or unknown substances/medications.\nOther substances/medications may pro-\nduce sleep disturbances, particularly medications that affect the central or autonomic\nnervous systems (e.g., adrenergic agonists and antagonists, dopamine agonists and antag-\nonists, cholinergic agonists and antagonists, serotonergic agonists and antagonists, anti-\nhistamines, corticosteroids).", "prevalence": "", "development_course": "Insomnia in children can be identified by either a parent or the child.

Difficulty understanding the meaning of what is read (e.g., may read text accurately\nbut not understand the sequence, relationships, inferences, or deeper meanings of\nwhat is read).\n3. Difficulties with spelling (e.g., may add, omit, or substitute vowels or consonants).\n4. Difficulties with written expression (e.g., makes multiple grammatical or punctua-\ntion errors within sentences; employs poor paragraph organization; written expres-\nsion of ideas lacks clarity).\n5. Difficulties mastering number sense, number facts, or calculation (e.g., has poor\nunderstanding of numbers, their magnitude, and relationships; counts on fingers to\nadd single-digit numbers instead of recalling the math fact as peers do; gets lost in\nthe midst of arithmetic computation and may switch procedures).\n6. Difficulties with mathematical reasoning (e.g., has severe difficulty applying math-\nematical concepts, facts, or procedures to solve quantitative problems).\nSpecific Learning Disorder\n67\nB. The affected academic skills are substantially and quantifiably below those expected\nfor the individual’s chronological age, and cause significant interference with academic\nor occupational performance, or with activities of daily living, as confirmed by individu-\nally administered standardized achievement measures and comprehensive clinical\nassessment. For individuals age 17 years and older, a documented history of impairing\nlearning difficulties may be substituted for the standardized assessment.\nC. The learning difficulties begin during school-age years but may not become fully man-\nifest until the demands for those affected academic skills exceed the individual’s lim-\nited capacities (e.g., as in timed tests, reading or writing lengthy complex reports for a\ntight deadline, excessively heavy academic loads).\nD. The learning difficulties are not better accounted for by intellectual disabilities, uncor-\nrected visual or auditory acuity, other mental or neurological disorders, psychosocial\nadversity, lack of proficiency in the language of academic instruction, or inadequate\neducational instruction.\nNote: The four diagnostic criteria are to be met based on a clinical synthesis of the indi-\nvidual’s history (developmental, medical, family, educational), school reports, and psycho-\neducational assessment.\nCoding note: Specify all academic domains and subskills that are impaired. When more\nthan one domain is impaired, each one should be coded individually according to the fol-\nlowing specifiers.\nSpecify if:\n315.00 (F81.0) With impairment in reading:\nWord reading accuracy\nReading rate or fluency\nReading comprehension\nNote: Dyslexia is an alternative term used to refer to a pattern of learning difficulties\ncharacterized by problems with accurate or fluent word recognition, poor decoding,\nand poor spelling abilities. If dyslexia is used to specify this particular pattern of dif-\nficulties, it is important also to specify any additional difficulties that are present,\nsuch as difficulties with reading comprehension or math reasoning.\n315.2 (F81.81) With impairment in written expression:\nSpelling accuracy\nGrammar and punctuation accuracy\nClarity or organization of written expression\n315.1 (F81.2) With impairment in mathematics:\nNumber sense\nMemorization of arithmetic facts\nAccurate or fluent calculation\nAccurate math reasoning\nNote: Dyscalculia is an alternative term used to refer to a pattern of difficulties char-\nacterized by problems processing numerical information, learning arithmetic facts,\nand performing accurate or fluent calculations. If dyscalculia is used to specify this\nparticular pattern of mathematic difficulties, it is important also to specify any addi-\ntional difficulties that are present, such as difficulties with math reasoning or word rea-\nsoning accuracy.\nSpecify current severity:\nMild: Some difficulties learning skills in one or two academic domains, but of mild enough\nseverity that the individual may be able to compensate or function well when provided with\nappropriate accommodations or support services, especially during the school years.\n68\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nModerate: Marked difficulties learning skills in one or more academic domains, so that\nthe individual is unlikely to become proficient without some intervals of intensive and\nspecialized teaching during the school years. Some accommodations or supportive\nservices at least part of the day at school, in the workplace, or at home may be needed\nto complete activities accurately and efficiently.\nSevere: Severe difficulties learning skills, affecting several academic domains, so that\nthe individual is unlikely to learn those skills without ongoing intensive individualized\nand specialized teaching for most of the school years. Even with an array of appropri-\nate accommodations or services at home, at school, or in the workplace, the individual\nmay not be able to complete all activities efficiently.315.4 (F82)\nA. The acquisition and execution of coordinated motor skills is substantially below that ex-\npected given the individual’s chronological age and opportunity for skill learning and\nuse. Difficulties are manifested as clumsiness (e.g., dropping or bumping into objects)\nas well as slowness and inaccuracy of performance of motor skills (e.g., catching an\nobject, using scissors or cutlery, handwriting, riding a bike, or participating in sports).\nB. The motor skills deficit in Criterion A significantly and persistently interferes with activ-\nities of daily living appropriate to chronological age (e.g., self-care and self-mainte-\nnance) and impacts academic/school productivity, prevocational and vocational\nactivities, leisure, and play.\nC. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.\nD. The motor skills deficits are not better explained by intellectual disability (intellectual devel-\nopmental disorder) or visual impairment and are not attributable to a neurological condi-\ntion affecting movement (e.g., cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, degenerative disorder).307.3 (F98.4)\nA. Repetitive, seemingly driven, and apparently purposeless motor behavior (e.g., hand\nshaking or waving, body rocking, head banging, self-biting, hitting own body).\nB. The repetitive motor behavior interferes with social, academic, or other activities and\nmay result in self-injury.\nC. Onset is in the early developmental period.\nD. The repetitive motor behavior is not attributable to the physiological effects of a sub-\nstance or neurological condition and is not better explained by another neurodevel-\nopmental or mental disorder (e.g., trichotillomania [hair-pulling disorder], obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder).\nSpecify if:\nWith self-injurious behavior (or behavior that would result in an injury if preventive\nmeasures were not used)\nWithout self-injurious behavior\nSpecify if:\nAssociated with a known medical or genetic condition, neurodevelopmental dis-\norder, or environmental factor (e.g., Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, intellectual disability\n[intellectual developmental disorder], intrauterine alcohol exposure)\n78\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nCoding note: Use additional code to identify the associated medical or genetic\ncondition, or neurodevelopmental disorder.\nSpecify current severity:\nMild: Symptoms are easily suppressed by sensory stimulus or distraction.\nModerate: Symptoms require explicit protective measures and behavioral modification.\nSevere: Continuous monitoring and protective measures are required to prevent seri-\nous injury.Note: A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movement or vocalization.\nTourette’s Disorder\n307.23 (F95.2)\nA.

Note that the ICD-10-\nCM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present\nfor the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the sub-\nstance-induced psychotic disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should\nrecord “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced psychotic disorder\n(e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced psychotic disorder”). If a moderate or\nsevere substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced psychotic disor-\nder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance]\nuse disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the co-\nmorbid substance use disorder.

The essential feature of catatonia is a marked psy-\nchomotor disturbance that may involve decreased motor activity, decreased engagement\nduring interview or physical examination, or excessive and peculiar motor activity. The\nclinical presentation of catatonia can be puzzling, as the psychomotor disturbance may\nrange from marked unresponsiveness to marked agitation. Motoric immobility may be se-\nvere (stupor) or moderate (catalepsy and waxy flexibility). Similarly, decreased engage-\nment may be severe (mutism) or moderate (negativism). Excessive and peculiar motor\nbehaviors can be complex (e.g., stereotypy) or simple (agitation) and may include echola-\nlia and echopraxia. In extreme cases, the same individual may wax and wane between de-\ncreased and excessive motor activity. The seemingly opposing clinical features and\nvariable manifestations of the diagnosis contribute to a lack of awareness and decreased\nrecognition of catatonia. During severe stages of catatonia, the individual may need care-\nful supervision to avoid self-harm or harming others.

The manic episode may have been preceded by and may be followed by hypo-\nmanic or major depressive episodes.\n124\nBipolar and Related Disorders\nManic Episode\nA. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood\nand abnormally and persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy, lasting at\nleast 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospi-\ntalization is necessary).\nB. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or\nmore) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a sig-\nnificant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior:\n1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.\n2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).\n3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.\n4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.\n5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external\nstimuli), as reported or observed.\n6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or\npsychomotor agitation (i.e., purposeless non-goal-directed activity).\n7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful conse-\nquences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or\nfoolish business investments).\nC. The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or\noccupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or oth-\ners, or there are psychotic features.\nD. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug\nof abuse, a medication, other treatment) or to another medical condition.\nNote: A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medi-\ncation, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the\nphysiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and,\ntherefore, a bipolar I diagnosis.\nNote: Criteria A–D constitute a manic episode. At least one lifetime manic episode is re-\nquired for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.\nHypomanic Episode\nA. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood\nand abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 4 consec-\nutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day.\nB. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and activity, three (or\nmore) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) have persisted, rep-\nresent a noticeable change from usual behavior, and have been present to a significant\ndegree:\n1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.\n2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).\n3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.\n4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.\n5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external\nstimuli), as reported or observed.\n6.

The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is uncharac-\nteristic of the individual when not symptomatic.\nD. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable by others.\nE. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupa-\ntional functioning or to necessitate hospitalization. If there are psychotic features, the\nepisode is, by definition, manic.\nF. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug\nof abuse, a medication, other treatment).\nNote: A full hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g.,\nmedication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond\nthe physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a hypomanic episode\ndiagnosis. However, caution is indicated so that one or two symptoms (particularly in-\ncreased irritability, edginess, or agitation following antidepressant use) are not taken\nas sufficient for diagnosis of a hypomanic episode, nor necessarily indicative of a bi-\npolar diathesis.\nNote: Criteria A–F constitute a hypomanic episode. Hypomanic episodes are common in\nbipolar I disorder but are not required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.\nMajor Depressive Episode\nA. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week\nperiod and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms\nis either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.\nNote: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical condi-\ntion.\n1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjec-\ntive report (e.g., feels sad, empty, or hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g.,\nappears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)\n2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the\nday, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation).\n3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than\n5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every\nday. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)\n4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.\n5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others; not\nmerely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).\n6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.\n7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delu-\nsional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).\n8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (ei-\nther by subjective account or as observed by others).\n9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation with-\nout a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.\nB. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning.\nC. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another\nmedical condition.\nNote: Criteria A–C constitute a major depressive episode. Major depressive episodes are\ncommon in bipolar I disorder but are not required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.\nNote: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a\nnatural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense\n126\nBipolar and Related Disorders\nsadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Cri-\nterion A, which may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms may be un-\nderstandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive\nepisode in addition to the normal response to a significant loss should also be carefully\nconsidered. This decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on\nthe individual’s history and the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context\nof loss.1\nBipolar I Disorder\nA. Criteria have been met for at least one manic episode (Criteria A–D under “Manic Ep-\nisode” above).\nB. The occurrence of the manic and major depressive episode(s) is not better explained\nby schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional dis-\norder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic\ndisorder.\nCoding and Recording Procedures\nThe diagnostic code for bipolar I disorder is based on type of current or most recent epi-\nsode and its status with respect to current severity, presence of psychotic features, and\nremission status. Current severity and psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria\nare currently met for a manic or major depressive episode. Remission specifiers are only\nindicated if the full criteria are not currently met for a manic, hypomanic, or major depres-\nsive episode. Codes are as follows:\n1In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that in\ngrief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss, while in MDE it is persistent\ndepressed mood and the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is\nlikely to decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of\ngrief. These waves tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The\ndepressed mood of a MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations.\nThe pain of grief may be accompanied by positive emotions and humor that are uncharacteristic\nof the pervasive unhappiness and misery characteristic of a major depressive episode. The\nthought content associated with grief generally features a preoccupation with thoughts and\nmemories of the deceased, rather than the self-critical or pessimistic ruminations seen in a MDE.\nIn grief, self-esteem is generally preserved, whereas in a MDE, feelings of worthlessness and self-\nloathing are common. If self-derogatory ideation is present in grief, it typically involves per-\nceived failings vis-à-vis the deceased (e.g., not visiting frequently enough, not telling the\ndeceased how much he or she was loved). If a bereaved individual thinks about death and dying,\nsuch thoughts are generally focused on the deceased and possibly about “joining” the deceased,\nwhereas in a major depressive episode such thoughts are focused on ending one’s own life\nbecause of feeling worthless, undeserving of life, or unable to cope with the pain of depression.\nBipolar I disorder\nCurrent or\nmost recent\nepisode\nmanic\nCurrent or\nmost recent\nepisode\nhypomanic*\nCurrent or\nmost recent\nepisode\ndepressed\nCurrent or\nmost recent\nepisode\nunspecified**\nMild (p. 154)\n296.41\n(F31.11)\nNA\n296.51\n(F31.31)\nNA\nModerate (p. 154)\n296.42\n(F31.12)\nNA\n296.52\n(F31.32)\nNA\nSevere (p. 154)\n296.43\n(F31.13)\nNA\n296.53\n(F31.4)\nNA\nBipolar I Disorder\n127\nIn recording the name of a diagnosis, terms should be listed in the following order: bipolar\nI disorder, type of current or most recent episode, severity/psychotic/remission specifiers,\nfollowed by as many specifiers without codes as apply to the current or most recent epi-\nsode.\nSpecify:\nWith anxious distress (p. 149)\nWith mixed features (pp. 149–150)\nWith rapid cycling (pp. 150–151)\nWith melancholic features (p. 151)\nWith atypical features (pp. 151–152)\nWith mood-congruent psychotic features (p. 152)\nWith mood-incongruent psychotic features (p. 152)\nWith catatonia (p. 152).

Its status with respect to cur-\nrent severity, presence of psychotic features, course, and other specifiers cannot be\ncoded but should be indicated in writing (e.g., 296.89 [F31.81] bipolar II disorder, current\nepisode depressed, moderate severity, with mixed features; 296.89 [F31.81] bipolar II dis-\norder, most recent episode depressed, in partial remission).\nSpecify current or most recent episode:\nHypomanic\nDepressed\nSpecify if:\nWith anxious distress (p. 149)\nWith mixed features (pp. 149–150)\n1In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that in grief\nthe predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss, while in a MDE it is persistent depressed\nmood and the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is likely to\ndecrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of grief.

The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication\nor withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.\n2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Crite-\nrion A.\nC. The disturbance is not better explained by a bipolar or related disorder that is not sub-\nstance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent bipolar or related disor-\nder could include the following:\nThe symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms per-\nsist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute\nwithdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the existence\nof an independent non-substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder\n(e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes).\nD.

The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning.\nCoding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]-\ninduced bipolar and related disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-\nCM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for\nthe same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-\ninduced bipolar and related disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should\nrecord “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced bipolar and related dis-\norder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced bipolar and related disorder”). If a\nmoderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced bipolar\nand related disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moder-\nate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity\nof the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g.,\nafter a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the\nclinician should record only the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder.\nICD-10-CM\nICD-9-CM\nWith use\ndisorder,\nmild\nWith use\ndisorder,\nmoderate\nor severe\nWithout\nuse\ndisorder\nAlcohol\n291.89\nF10.14\nF10.24\nF10.94\nPhencyclidine\n292.84\nF16.14\nF16.24\nF16.94\nOther hallucinogen\n292.84\nF16.14\nF16.24\nF16.94\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder\n143\nSpecify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders” for di-\nagnoses associated with substance class):\nWith onset during intoxication: If the criteria are met for intoxication with the sub-\nstance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.\nWith onset during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance\nand the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.A.

The behaviors do not occur exclusively during an episode of major depressive disorder\nand are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., autism spectrum disor-\nder, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety disorder, persistent depressive\ndisorder [dysthymia]).\nNote: This diagnosis cannot coexist with oppositional defiant disorder, intermittent ex-\nplosive disorder, or bipolar disorder, though it can coexist with others, including major\ndepressive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and\nsubstance use disorders. Individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for both disruptive\nmood dysregulation disorder and oppositional defiant disorder should only be given the\ndiagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. If an individual has ever experi-\nenced a manic or hypomanic episode, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation\ndisorder should not be assigned.\nK. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or to an-\nother medical or neurological condition.A. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week\nperiod and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms\nis either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.\nNote: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical condition.\n1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjec-\ntive report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g.,\nappears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)\n2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the\nday, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation).\nMajor Depressive Disorder\n161\n3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than\n5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day.\n(Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)\n4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.\n5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not\nmerely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).\n6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.\n7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delu-\nsional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).\n8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (ei-\nther by subjective account or as observed by others).\n9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation with-\nout a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.\nB. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning.\nC. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or to another\nmedical condition.\nNote: Criteria A–C represent a major depressive episode.\nNote: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a nat-\nural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense sad-\nness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion A,\nwhich may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms may be understand-\nable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive episode in\naddition to the normal response to a significant loss should also be carefully considered. This\ndecision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual’s history\nand the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss.1\nD. The occurrence of the major depressive episode is not better explained by schizoaf-\nfective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or\nother specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.\nE. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode.\nNote: This exclusion does not apply if all of the manic-like or hypomanic-like episodes\nare substance-induced or are attributable to the physiological effects of another med-\nical condition.\n1In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that in\ngrief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss, while in MDE it is persistent\ndepressed mood and the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is\nlikely to decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of\ngrief. These waves tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The\ndepressed mood of MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations.\nThe pain of grief may be accompanied by positive emotions and humor that are uncharacteristic\nof the pervasive unhappiness and misery characteristic of MDE. The thought content associated\nwith grief generally features a preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the deceased,\nrather than the self-critical or pessimistic ruminations seen in MDE. In grief, self-esteem is gener-\nally preserved, whereas in MDE feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common. If self-\nderogatory ideation is present in grief, it typically involves perceived failings vis-à-vis the\ndeceased (e.g., not visiting frequently enough, not telling the deceased how much he or she was\nloved). If a bereaved individual thinks about death and dying, such thoughts are generally\nfocused on the deceased and possibly about “joining” the deceased, whereas in MDE such\nthoughts are focused on ending one’s own life because of feeling worthless, undeserving of life,\nor unable to cope with the pain of depression.\n162\nDepressive Disorders\nCoding and Recording Procedures\nThe diagnostic code for major depressive disorder is based on whether this is a single or\nrecurrent episode, current severity, presence of psychotic features, and remission status.\nCurrent severity and psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria are currently met\nfor a major depressive episode. Remission specifiers are only indicated if the full criteria\nare not currently met for a major depressive episode. Codes are as follows:\nIn recording the name of a diagnosis, terms should be listed in the following order: major\ndepressive disorder, single or recurrent episode, severity/psychotic/remission specifiers,\nfollowed by as many of the following specifiers without codes that apply to the current\nepisode.\nSpecify:\nWith anxious distress (p. 184)\nWith mixed features (pp. 184–185)\nWith melancholic features (p. 185)\nWith atypical features (pp. 185–186)\nWith mood-congruent psychotic features (p. 186)\nWith mood-incongruent psychotic features (p. 186)\nWith catatonia (p. 186). Coding note: Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1).\nWith peripartum onset (pp. 186–187)\nWith seasonal pattern (recurrent episode only) (pp. 187–188)300.4 (F34.1)\nThis disorder represents a consolidation of DSM-IV-defined chronic major depressive dis-\norder and dysthymic disorder.\nA. Depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, as indicated by either\nsubjective account or observation by others, for at least 2 years.\nNote: In children and adolescents, mood can be irritable and duration must be at least\n1 year.\nB. Presence, while depressed, of two (or more) of the following:\n1. Poor appetite or overeating.\n2. Insomnia or hypersomnia.\n3. Low energy or fatigue.\n4. Low self-esteem.\n5. Poor concentration or difficulty making decisions.\n6. Feelings of hopelessness.\nC. During the 2-year period (1 year for children or adolescents) of the disturbance, the individ-\nual has never been without the symptoms in Criteria A and B for more than 2 months at a\ntime.\nD. Criteria for a major depressive disorder may be continuously present for 2 years.\nE. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode, and criteria have\nnever been met for cyclothymic disorder.\nF. The disturbance is not better explained by a persistent schizoaffective disorder,\nschizophrenia, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia\nspectrum and other psychotic disorder.\nG. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a\ndrug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g. hypothyroidism).\nH. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,\nor other important areas of functioning.\nNote: Because the criteria for a major depressive episode include four symptoms that are\nabsent from the symptom list for persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), a very limited\nPersistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)\n169\nnumber of individuals will have depressive symptoms that have persisted longer than 2 years\nbut will not meet criteria for persistent depressive disorder. If full criteria for a major de-\npressive episode have been met at some point during the current episode of illness, they\nshould be given a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Otherwise, a diagnosis of other\nspecified depressive disorder or unspecified depressive disorder is warranted.\nSpecify if:\nWith anxious distress (p. 184)\nWith mixed features (pp. 184–185)\nWith melancholic features (p. 185)\nWith atypical features (pp. 185–186)\nWith mood-congruent psychotic features (p. 186)\nWith mood-incongruent psychotic features (p. 186)\nWith peripartum onset (pp. 186–187)\nSpecify if:\nIn partial remission (p. 188)\nIn full remission (p. 188)\nSpecify if:\nEarly onset: If onset is before age 21 years.\nLate onset: If onset is at age 21 years or older.\nSpecify if (for most recent 2 years of persistent depressive disorder):\nWith pure dysthymic syndrome: Full criteria for a major depressive episode have not\nbeen met in at least the preceding 2 years.\nWith persistent major depressive episode: Full criteria for a major depressive epi-\nsode have been met throughout the preceding 2-year period.\nWith intermittent major depressive episodes, with current episode: Full criteria for\na major depressive episode are currently met, but there have been periods of at least\n8 weeks in at least the preceding 2 years with symptoms below the threshold for a full\nmajor depressive episode.\nWith intermittent major depressive episodes, without current episode: Full crite-\nria for a major depressive episode are not currently met, but there has been one or\nmore major depressive episodes in at least the preceding 2 years.\nSpecify current severity:\nMild (p. 188)\nModerate (p. 188)\nSevere (p. 188)625.4 (N94.3)\nA. In the majority of menstrual cycles, at least five symptoms must be present in the final\nweek before the onset of menses, start to improve within a few days after the onset of\nmenses, and become minimal or absent in the week postmenses.\nB. One (or more) of the following symptoms must be present:\n1. Marked affective lability (e.g., mood swings; feeling suddenly sad or tearful, or in-\ncreased sensitivity to rejection).\n172\nDepressive Disorders\n2. Marked irritability or anger or increased interpersonal conflicts.\n3. Marked depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, or self-deprecating thoughts.\n4. Marked anxiety, tension, and/or feelings of being keyed up or on edge.\nC. One (or more) of the following symptoms must additionally be present, to reach a total\nof five symptoms when combined with symptoms from Criterion B above.\n1. Decreased interest in usual activities (e.g., work, school, friends, hobbies).\n2. Subjective difficulty in concentration.\n3. Lethargy, easy fatigability, or marked lack of energy.\n4. Marked change in appetite; overeating; or specific food cravings.\n5. Hypersomnia or insomnia.\n6. A sense of being overwhelmed or out of control.\n7. Physical symptoms such as breast tenderness or swelling, joint or muscle pain, a\nsensation of “bloating,” or weight gain.\nNote: The symptoms in Criteria A–C must have been met for most menstrual cycles that\noccurred in the preceding year.\nD. The symptoms are associated with clinically significant distress or interference with\nwork, school, usual social activities, or relationships with others (e.g., avoidance of so-\ncial activities; decreased productivity and efficiency at work, school, or home).\nE. The disturbance is not merely an exacerbation of the symptoms of another disorder,\nsuch as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, persistent depressive disorder\n(dysthymia), or a personality disorder (although it may co-occur with any of these dis-\norders).\nF. Criterion A should be confirmed by prospective daily ratings during at least two symptom-\natic cycles. (Note: The diagnosis may be made provisionally prior to this confirmation.)\nG. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a\ndrug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or another medical condition (e.g., hy-\nperthyroidism).A. A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predominates in the clinical pic-\nture and is characterized by depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or plea-\nsure in all, or almost all, activities.\nB. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both\n(1) and (2):\n1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication\nor withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.\n2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Crite-\nrion A.\nC. The disturbance is not better explained by a depressive disorder that is not substance/\nmedication-induced. Such evidence of an independent depressive disorder could in-\nclude the following:\nThe symptoms preceded the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms\npersist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute\nwithdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the existence\nof an independent non-substance/medication-induced depressive disorder (e.g., a his-\ntory of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes).\nD. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.\nE. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning.\nNote: This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or\nsubstance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical\npicture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.\nCoding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medica-\ntion]-induced depressive disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-\n176\nDepressive Disorders\nCM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for\nthe same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-\ninduced depressive disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record\n“mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced depressive disorder (e.g.,\n“mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced depressive disorder”). If a moderate or se-\nvere substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced depressive disorder,\nthe 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use\ndisorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid\nsubstance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-\ntime heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should\nrecord only the substance-induced depressive disorder.\nSpecify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders” for di-\nagnoses associated with substance class):\nWith onset during intoxication: If criteria are met for intoxication with the substance\nand the symptoms develop during intoxication.\nWith onset during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance\nand the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.A. A prominent and persistent period of depressed mood or markedly diminished interest\nor pleasure in all, or almost all, activities that predominates in the clinical picture.\nB. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the\ndisturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condi-\ntion.\nC. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., adjustment\ndisorder, with depressed mood, in which the stressor is a serious medical condition).\nD. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.\nE. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning.\nCoding note: The ICD-9-CM code for depressive disorder due to another medical condi-\ntion is 293.83, which is assigned regardless of the specifier. The ICD-10-CM code de-\npends on the specifier (see below).\nDepressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\n181\nSpecify if:\n(F06.31) With depressive features: Full criteria are not met for a major depressive\nepisode.\n(F06.32) With major depressive–like episode: Full criteria are met (except Criterion\nC) for a major depressive episode.\n(F06.34) With mixed features: Symptoms of mania or hypomania are also present but\ndo not predominate in the clinical picture.\nCoding note: Include the name of the other medical condition in the name of the mental dis-\norder (e.g., 293.83 [F06.31] depressive disorder due to hypothyroidism, with depressive fea-\ntures). The other medical condition should also be coded and listed separately immediately\nbefore the depressive disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., 244.9 [E03.9] hypothyroid-\nism; 293.83 [F06.31] depressive disorder due to hypothyroidism, with depressive features).309.21 (F93.0)\nA. Developmentally inappropriate and excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation from\nthose to whom the individual is attached, as evidenced by at least three of the following:\n1. Recurrent excessive distress when anticipating or experiencing separation from\nhome or from major attachment figures.\nSeparation Anxiety Disorder\n191\n2. Persistent and excessive worry about losing major attachment figures or about pos-\nsible harm to them, such as illness, injury, disasters, or death.\n3. Persistent and excessive worry about experiencing an untoward event (e.g., getting\nlost, being kidnapped, having an accident, becoming ill) that causes separation\nfrom a major attachment figure.\n4. Persistent reluctance or refusal to go out, away from home, to school, to work, or\nelsewhere because of fear of separation.\n5. Persistent and excessive fear of or reluctance about being alone or without major\nattachment figures at home or in other settings.\n6. Persistent reluctance or refusal to sleep away from home or to go to sleep without\nbeing near a major attachment figure.\n7. Repeated nightmares involving the theme of separation.\n8. Repeated complaints of physical symptoms (e.g., headaches, stomachaches, nau-\nsea, vomiting) when separation from major attachment figures occurs or is antici-\npated.\nB. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, lasting at least 4 weeks in children and\nadolescents and typically 6 months or more in adults.\nC. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, aca-\ndemic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\nD. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as refusing\nto leave home because of excessive resistance to change in autism spectrum disorder;\ndelusions or hallucinations concerning separation in psychotic disorders; refusal to go\noutside without a trusted companion in agoraphobia; worries about ill health or other\nharm befalling significant others in generalized anxiety disorder; or concerns about\nhaving an illness in illness anxiety disorder.313.23 (F94.0)\nA. Consistent failure to speak in specific social situations in which there is an expectation\nfor speaking (e.g., at school) despite speaking in other situations.\nB. The disturbance interferes with educational or occupational achievement or with social\ncommunication.\nC. The duration of the disturbance is at least 1 month (not limited to the first month of\nschool).\nD. The failure to speak is not attributable to a lack of knowledge of, or comfort with, the\nspoken language required in the social situation.\nE. The disturbance is not better explained by a communication disorder (e.g., childhood-\nonset fluency disorder) and does not occur exclusively during the course of autism\nspectrum disorder, schizophrenia, or another psychotic disorder.A. Marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation (e.g., flying, heights, animals,\nreceiving an injection, seeing blood).\nNote: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing,\nor clinging.\nB. The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear or anxiety.\nC. The phobic object or situation is actively avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety.\nD. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific object\nor situation and to the sociocultural context.\nE. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more.\nF. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in\nsocial, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\nG. The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder,\nincluding fear, anxiety, and avoidance of situations associated with panic-like symptoms\nor other incapacitating symptoms (as in agoraphobia); objects or situations related to\nobsessions (as in obsessive-compulsive disorder); reminders of traumatic events (as in\nposttraumatic stress disorder); separation from home or attachment figures (as in sep-\naration anxiety disorder); or social situations (as in social anxiety disorder).\n198\nAnxiety Disorders\nSpecify if:\nCode based on the phobic stimulus:\n300.29 (F40.218) Animal (e.g., spiders, insects, dogs).\n300.29 (F40.228) Natural environment (e.g., heights, storms, water).\n300.29 (F40.23x) Blood-injection-injury (e.g., needles, invasive medical procedures).\nCoding note: Select specific ICD-10-CM code as follows: F40.230 fear of blood;\nF40.231 fear of injections and transfusions; F40.232 fear of other medical care; or\nF40.233 fear of injury.\n300.29 (F40.248) Situational (e.g., airplanes, elevators, enclosed places).\n300.29 (F40.298) Other (e.g., situations that may lead to choking or vomiting; in chil-\ndren, e.g., loud sounds or costumed characters).\nCoding note: When more than one phobic stimulus is present, code all ICD-10-CM codes\nthat apply (e.g., for fear of snakes and flying, F40.218 specific phobia, animal, and\nF40.248 specific phobia, situational).300.23 (F40.10)\nA. Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is\nexposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions (e.g., hav-\ning a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eating or drink-\ning), and performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech).\nNote: In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interac-\ntions with adults.\nB. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will\nbe negatively evaluated (i.e., will be humiliating or embarrassing; will lead to rejection\nor offend others).\nC.

The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a\ndrug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism, car-\ndiopulmonary disorders).\nD. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., the panic at-\ntacks do not occur only in response to feared social situations, as in social anxiety dis-\norder; in response to circumscribed phobic objects or situations, as in specific phobia;\nin response to obsessions, as in obsessive-compulsive disorder; in response to re-\nminders of traumatic events, as in posttraumatic stress disorder; or in response to sep-\naration from attachment figures, as in separation anxiety disorder).300.22 (F40.00)\nA.

The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more.\nG. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in\nsocial, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\nH. If another medical condition (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson’s disease)\nis present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly excessive.\nI.\nThe fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another men-\ntal disorder—for example, the symptoms are not confined to specific phobia, situational\ntype; do not involve only social situations (as in social anxiety disorder); and are not re-\nlated exclusively to obsessions (as in obsessive-compulsive disorder), perceived defects\nor flaws in physical appearance (as in body dysmorphic disorder), reminders of traumatic\nevents (as in posttraumatic stress disorder), or fear of separation (as in separation anx-\niety disorder).\nNote: Agoraphobia is diagnosed irrespective of the presence of panic disorder. If an indi-\nvidual’s presentation meets criteria for panic disorder and agoraphobia, both diagnoses\nshould be assigned.300.02 (F41.1)\nA. Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than\nnot for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school\nperformance).\nB. The individual finds it difficult to control the worry.\nC.

Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge.\n2. Being easily fatigued.\n3. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank.\n4. Irritability.\n5. Muscle tension.\n6. Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying\nsleep).\nD. The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impair-\nment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\nE. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a\ndrug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).\nF. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., anxiety or\nworry about having panic attacks in panic disorder, negative evaluation in social anxi-\nety disorder [social phobia], contamination or other obsessions in obsessive-compul-\nsive disorder, separation from attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder,\nreminders of traumatic events in posttraumatic stress disorder, gaining weight in an-\norexia nervosa, physical complaints in somatic symptom disorder, perceived appear-\nance flaws in body dysmorphic disorder, having a serious illness in illness anxiety\ndisorder, or the content of delusional beliefs in schizophrenia or delusional disorder).A. Panic attacks or anxiety is predominant in the clinical picture.\nB. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both\n(1) and (2):\n1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication\nor withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.\n2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Crite-\nrion A.\nC. The disturbance is not better explained by an anxiety disorder that is not substance/\nmedication-induced. Such evidence of an independent anxiety disorder could include\nthe following:\nThe symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms\npersist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of\nacute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the\nexistence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder\n(e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes).\nD. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.\nE. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning.\nNote: This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or\nsubstance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical\npicture and they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.\nCoding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medica-\ntion]-induced anxiety disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM\ncode depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for\nthe same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the sub-\nstance-induced anxiety disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should\nrecord “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced anxiety disorder\n(e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced anxiety disorder”). If a moderate or\nsevere substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced anxiety disorder,\nthe 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use\ndisorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid\nsubstance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder\n227\ntime heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician\nshould record only the substance-induced anxiety disorder.\nSpecify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders” for di-\nagnoses associated with substance class):\nWith onset during intoxication: This specifier applies if criteria are met for intoxica-\ntion with the substance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.\nWith onset during withdrawal: This specifier applies if criteria are met for withdrawal\nfrom the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.\nWith onset after medication use: Symptoms may appear either at initiation of medi-\ncation or after a modification or change in use.293.84 (F06.4)\nA. Panic attacks or anxiety is predominant in the clinical picture.\nB. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the dis-\nturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition.\nC. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder.\nD. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.\nE. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning.\nCoding note: Include the name of the other medical condition within the name of the men-\ntal disorder (e.g., 293.84 [F06.4] anxiety disorder due to pheochromocytoma). The other\nmedical condition should be coded and listed separately immediately before the anxiety\ndisorder due to the medical condition (e.g., 227.0 [D35.00] pheochromocytoma; 293.84\n[F06.4] anxiety disorder due to pheochromocytoma.300.3 (F42)\nA. Presence of obsessions, compulsions, or both:\nObsessions are defined by (1) and (2):\n1. Recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced, at some\ntime during the disturbance, as intrusive and unwanted, and that in most individuals\ncause marked anxiety or distress.\n2. The individual attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, urges, or images, or to\nneutralize them with some other thought or action (i.e., by performing a compulsion).\nCompulsions are defined by (1) and (2):\n1. Repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand washing, ordering, checking) or mental acts (e.g.,\npraying, counting, repeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to per-\nform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.\n2. The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing anxiety or dis-\ntress, or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or\nmental acts are not connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neu-\ntralize or prevent, or are clearly excessive.\nNote: Young children may not be able to articulate the aims of these behaviors or\nmental acts.\nB. The obsessions or compulsions are time-consuming (e.g., take more than 1 hour per\nday) or cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or\nother important areas of functioning.\nC. The obsessive-compulsive symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects\nof a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.\nD. The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder\n(e.g., excessive worries, as in generalized anxiety disorder; preoccupation with ap-\npearance, as in body dysmorphic disorder; difficulty discarding or parting with posses-\nsions, as in hoarding disorder; hair pulling, as in trichotillomania [hair-pulling disorder];\nskin picking, as in excoriation [skin-picking] disorder; stereotypies, as in stereotypic\nmovement disorder; ritualized eating behavior, as in eating disorders; preoccupation\nwith substances or gambling, as in substance-related and addictive disorders; preoc-\ncupation with having an illness, as in illness anxiety disorder; sexual urges or fantasies,\nas in paraphilic disorders; impulses, as in disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct dis-\norders; guilty ruminations, as in major depressive disorder; thought insertion or delu-\nsional preoccupations, as in schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders; or\nrepetitive patterns of behavior, as in autism spectrum disorder).\nSpecify if:\nWith good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that obsessive-compulsive dis-\norder beliefs are definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be true.\nWith poor insight: The individual thinks obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs are\nprobably true.\nWith absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is completely convinced that\nobsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs are true.\nSpecify if:\nTic-related: The individual has a current or past history of a tic disorder.\n238\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders300.7 (F45.22)\nA. Preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance that\nare not observable or appear slight to others.\nB. At some point during the course of the disorder, the individual has performed repetitive\nbehaviors (e.g., mirror checking, excessive grooming, skin picking, reassurance seek-\ning) or mental acts (e.g., comparing his or her appearance with that of others) in re-\nsponse to the appearance concerns.\nC. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-\npational, or other important areas of functioning.\nD. The appearance preoccupation is not better explained by concerns with body fat or\nweight in an individual whose symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder.\nBody Dysmorphic Disorder\n243\nSpecify if:\nWith muscle dysmorphia: The individual is preoccupied with the idea that his or her\nbody build is too small or insufficiently muscular. This specifier is used even if the indi-\nvidual is preoccupied with other body areas, which is often the case.\nSpecify if:\nIndicate degree of insight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs (e.g., “I look ugly” or\n“I look deformed”).\nWith good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that the body dysmorphic disor-\nder beliefs are definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be true.\nWith poor insight: The individual thinks that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are\nprobably true.\nWith absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is completely convinced that\nthe body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true.300.3 (F42)\nA. Persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value.\nB. This difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and to distress associated\nwith discarding them.\nC. The difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that\ncongest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended\nuse. If living areas are uncluttered, it is only because of the interventions of third parties\n(e.g., family members, cleaners, authorities).\nD. The hoarding causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning (including maintaining a safe environ-\nment for self and others).\nE. The hoarding is not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., brain injury, cere-\nbrovascular disease, Prader-Willi syndrome).\nF. The hoarding is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g.,\nobsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder, decreased energy in major depressive\ndisorder, delusions in schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder, cognitive deficits in\nmajor neurocognitive disorder, restricted interests in autism spectrum disorder).\nSpecify if:\nWith excessive acquisition: If difficulty discarding possessions is accompanied by ex-\ncessive acquisition of items that are not needed or for which there is no available space.\nSpecify if:\nWith good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that hoarding-related beliefs and\nbehaviors (pertaining to difficulty discarding items, clutter, or excessive acquisition) are\nproblematic.\nWith poor insight: The individual is mostly convinced that hoarding-related beliefs\nand behaviors (pertaining to difficulty discarding items, clutter, or excessive acquisi-\ntion) are not problematic despite evidence to the contrary.\nWith absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is completely convinced that\nhoarding-related beliefs and behaviors (pertaining to difficulty discarding items, clutter,\nor excessive acquisition) are not problematic despite evidence to the contrary.\n248\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorderstation, because individuals are unlikely to spontaneously report hoarding symptoms, and\nthese symptoms are often not asked about in routine clinical interviews.\nTrichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)312.39 (F63.3)\nA. Recurrent pulling out of one’s hair, resulting in hair loss.\nB. Repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling.\nC. The hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning.\nD. The hair pulling or hair loss is not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., a der-\nmatological condition).\nE. The hair pulling is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder\n(e.g., attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw in appearance in body dysmorphic\ndisorder).698.4 (L98.1)\nA. Recurrent skin picking resulting in skin lesions.\nB. Repeated attempts to decrease or stop skin picking.\nC. The skin picking causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning.\nD. The skin picking is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., co-\ncaine) or another medical condition (e.g., scabies).\nE. The skin picking is not better explained by symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g.,\ndelusions or tactile hallucinations in a psychotic disorder, attempts to improve a per-\nceived defect or flaw in appearance in body dysmorphic disorder, stereotypies in ste-\nreotypic movement disorder, or intention to harm oneself in nonsuicidal self-injury).A. Obsessions, compulsions, skin picking, hair pulling, other body-focused repetitive be-\nhaviors, or other symptoms characteristic of the obsessive-compulsive and related dis-\norders predominate in the clinical picture.\nB. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both\n(1) and (2):\n1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication\nor withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.\n2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Crite-\nrion A.\nC. The disturbance is not better explained by an obsessive-compulsive and related disor-\nder that is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent ob-\nsessive-compulsive and related disorder could include the following:\nThe symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms\npersist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute\nwithdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the exis-\ntence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced obsessive-compul-\nsive and related disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-\nrelated episodes).\nD. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.\nE. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning.\nNote: This diagnosis should be made in addition to a diagnosis of substance intoxication\nor substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical\npicture and are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.\nCoding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medica-\ntion]-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorders are indicated in the table below.\nNote that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance\nuse disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is\ncomorbid with the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, the 4th\nposition character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder”\nbefore the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (e.g., “mild co-\ncaine use disorder with cocaine-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder”). If\na moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced ob-\nsessive-compulsive and related disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician\nshould record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,”\ndepending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid\n258\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\nsubstance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th\nposition character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the substance-induced ob-\nsessive-compulsive and related disorder.\nSpecify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders” for di-\nagnoses associated with substance class):\nWith onset during intoxication: If the criteria are met for intoxication with the sub-\nstance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.\nWith onset during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance\nand the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.\nWith onset after medication use: Symptoms may appear either at initiation of medi-\ncation or after a modification or change in use.294.8 (F06.8)\nA. Obsessions, compulsions, preoccupations with appearance, hoarding, skin picking,\nhair pulling, other body-focused repetitive behaviors, or other symptoms characteristic\nof obsessive-compulsive and related disorder predominate in the clinical picture.\nB. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the\ndisturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition.\nC. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder.\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\n261\nD. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.\nE. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning.\nSpecify if:\nWith obsessive-compulsive disorder–like symptoms: If obsessive-compulsive dis-\norder–like symptoms predominate in the clinical presentation.\nWith appearance preoccupations: If preoccupation with perceived appearance de-\nfects or flaws predominates in the clinical presentation.\nWith hoarding symptoms: If hoarding predominates in the clinical presentation.\nWith hair-pulling symptoms: If hair pulling predominates in the clinical presentation.\nWith skin-picking symptoms: If skin picking predominates in the clinical presenta-\ntion.\nCoding note: Include the name of the other medical condition in the name of the mental\ndisorder (e.g., 294.8 [F06.8] obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to cerebral\ninfarction). The other medical condition should be coded and listed separately immediately\nbefore the obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to the medical condition (e.g.,\n438.89 [I69.398] cerebral infarction; 294.8 [F06.8] obsessive-compulsive and related dis-\norder due to cerebral infarction).313.89 (F94.1)\nA. A consistent pattern of inhibited, emotionally withdrawn behavior toward adult caregiv-\ners, manifested by both of the following:\n1. The child rarely or minimally seeks comfort when distressed.\n2. The child rarely or minimally responds to comfort when distressed.\nB. A persistent social and emotional disturbance characterized by at least two of the following:\n1.

The diagnosis of insomnia disorder is given whether it occurs as an independent\ncondition or is comorbid with another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder),\nmedical condition (e.g., pain), or another sleep disorder (e.g., a breathing-related sleep dis-\norder). For instance, insomnia may develop its own course with some anxiety and depres-\nsive features but in the absence of criteria being met for any one mental disorder. Insomnia\nmay also manifest as a clinical feature of a more predominant mental disorder. Persistent\ninsomnia may even be a risk factor for depression and is a common residual symptom af-\nter treatment for this condition. With comorbid insomnia and a mental disorder, treatment\nmay also need to target both conditions. Given these different courses, it is often impossi-\nble to establish the precise nature of the relationship between these clinical entities, and\nthis relationship may change over time. Therefore, in the presence of insomnia and a co-\nmorbid disorder, it is not necessary to make a causal attribution between the two condi-\ntions. Rather, the diagnosis of insomnia disorder is made with concurrent specification of\nthe clinically comorbid conditions. A concurrent insomnia diagnosis should only be con-\nsidered when the insomnia is sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention;\notherwise, no separate diagnosis is necessary.307.44 (F51.11)\nA.

Note that the ICD-10-CM\ncode depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for\nthe same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the sub-\nstance-induced sleep disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should\nrecord “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced sleep disorder (e.g.,\n“mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced sleep disorder”). If a moderate or severe\nsubstance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sleep disorder, the 4th po-\nsition character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder”\nor “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance\nuse disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy\nuse of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record\nonly the substance-induced sleep disorder. A moderate or severe tobacco use disorder is\nrequired in order to code a tobacco-induced sleep disorder; it is not permissible to code a\ncomorbid mild tobacco use disorder or no tobacco use disorder with a tobacco-induced\nsleep disorder.\nSpecify whether:\nInsomnia type: Characterized by difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep, frequent\nnocturnal awakenings, or nonrestorative sleep.\nDaytime sleepiness type: Characterized by predominant complaint of excessive\nsleepiness/fatigue during waking hours or, less commonly, a long sleep period.\nParasomnia type: Characterized by abnormal behavioral events during sleep.\nMixed type: Characterized by a substance/medication-induced sleep problem charac-\nterized by multiple types of sleep symptoms, but no symptom clearly predominates.\nSpecify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders” for di-\nagnoses associated with substance class):\nWith onset during intoxication: This specifier should be used if criteria are met for\nintoxication with the substance/medication and symptoms developed during the intox-\nication period.\nWith onset during discontinuation/withdrawal: This specifier should be used if cri-\nteria are met for discontinuation/withdrawal from the substance/medication and symp-\ntoms developed during, or shortly after, discontinuation of the substance/medication.\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder\n415302.74 (F52.32)\nA.

A pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness lasting\nat least 6 months as evidenced by at least four symptoms from any of the following cate-\ngories, and exhibited during interaction with at least one individual who is not a sibling.\nAngry/Irritable Mood\n1. Often loses temper.\n2. Is often touchy or easily annoyed.\n3. Is often angry and resentful.\nArgumentative/Defiant Behavior\n4. Often argues with authority figures or, for children and adolescents, with adults.\n5. Often actively defies or refuses to comply with requests from authority figures or\nwith rules.\n6. Often deliberately annoys others.\n7. Often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior.\nVindictiveness\n8. Has been spiteful or vindictive at least twice within the past 6 months.\nNote: The persistence and frequency of these behaviors should be used to distinguish\na behavior that is within normal limits from a behavior that is symptomatic. For children\nyounger than 5 years, the behavior should occur on most days for a period of at least\n6 months unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8). For individuals 5 years or older, the\nbehavior should occur at least once per week for at least 6 months, unless otherwise\nnoted (Criterion A8). While these frequency criteria provide guidance on a minimal lev-\nel of frequency to define symptoms, other factors should also be considered, such as\nwhether the frequency and intensity of the behaviors are outside a range that is nor-\nmative for the individual’s developmental level, gender, and culture.\nB. The disturbance in behavior is associated with distress in the individual or others in his or\nher immediate social context (e.g., family, peer group, work colleagues), or it impacts neg-\natively on social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\nC. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during the course of a psychotic, substance\nuse, depressive, or bipolar disorder. Also, the criteria are not met for disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder.\nSpecify current severity:\nMild: Symptoms are confined to only one setting (e.g., at home, at school, at work, with\npeers).\nOppositional Defiant Disorder\n463\nModerate: Some symptoms are present in at least two settings.\nSevere: Some symptoms are present in three or more settings.312.34 (F63.81)\nA. Recurrent behavioral outbursts representing a failure to control aggressive impulses\nas manifested by either of the following:\n1. Verbal aggression (e.g., temper tantrums, tirades, verbal arguments or fights) or\nphysical aggression toward property, animals, or other individuals, occurring twice\nweekly, on average, for a period of 3 months. The physical aggression does not re-\nsult in damage or destruction of property and does not result in physical injury to\nanimals or other individuals.\n2. Three behavioral outbursts involving damage or destruction of property and/or\nphysical assault involving physical injury against animals or other individuals occur-\nring within a 12-month period.\nB. The magnitude of aggressiveness expressed during the recurrent outbursts is grossly\nout of proportion to the provocation or to any precipitating psychosocial stressors.\nC. The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not premeditated (i.e., they are impulsive and/\nor anger-based) and are not committed to achieve some tangible objective (e.g.,\nmoney, power, intimidation).\nD. The recurrent aggressive outbursts cause either marked distress in the individual or\nimpairment in occupational or interpersonal functioning, or are associated with finan-\ncial or legal consequences.\nE. Chronological age is at least 6 years (or equivalent developmental level).\nF. The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not better explained by another mental disor-\nder (e.g., major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation\ndisorder, a psychotic disorder, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality\ndisorder) and are not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., head trauma, Alz-\nheimer’s disease) or to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse,\na medication). For children ages 6–18 years, aggressive behavior that occurs as part\nof an adjustment disorder should not be considered for this diagnosis.\nNote: This diagnosis can be made in addition to the diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyper-\nactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or autism spectrum dis-\norder when recurrent impulsive aggressive outbursts are in excess of those usually seen\nin these disorders and warrant independent clinical attention.A. A repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or ma-\njor age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated, as manifested by the presence\nof at least three of the following 15 criteria in the past 12 months from any of the cate-\ngories below, with at least one criterion present in the past 6 months:\nAggression to People and Animals\n1. Often bullies, threatens, or intimidates others.\n2. Often initiates physical fights.\n3. Has used a weapon that can cause serious physical harm to others (e.g., a bat,\nbrick, broken bottle, knife, gun).\n470\nDisruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders\n4. Has been physically cruel to people.\n5. Has been physically cruel to animals.\n6. Has stolen while confronting a victim (e.g., mugging, purse snatching, extortion,\narmed robbery).\n7. Has forced someone into sexual activity.\nDestruction of Property\n8. Has deliberately engaged in fire setting with the intention of causing serious damage.\n9. Has deliberately destroyed others’ property (other than by fire setting).\nDeceitfulness or Theft\n10. Has broken into someone else’s house, building, or car.\n11. Often lies to obtain goods or favors or to avoid obligations (i.e., “cons” others).\n12. Has stolen items of nontrivial value without confronting a victim (e.g., shoplifting,\nbut without breaking and entering; forgery).\nSerious Violations of Rules\n13. Often stays out at night despite parental prohibitions, beginning before age 13 years.\n14. Has run away from home overnight at least twice while living in the parental or pa-\nrental surrogate home, or once without returning for a lengthy period.\n15. Is often truant from school, beginning before age 13 years.\nB. The disturbance in behavior causes clinically significant impairment in social, aca-\ndemic, or occupational functioning.\nC. If the individual is age 18 years or older, criteria are not met for antisocial personality\ndisorder.\nSpecify whether:\n312.81 (F91.1) Childhood-onset type: Individuals show at least one symptom char-\nacteristic of conduct disorder prior to age 10 years.\n312.82 (F91.2) Adolescent-onset type: Individuals show no symptom characteristic\nof conduct disorder prior to age 10 years.\n312.89 (F91.9) Unspecified onset: Criteria for a diagnosis of conduct disorder are\nmet, but there is not enough information available to determine whether the onset of\nthe first symptom was before or after age 10 years.\nSpecify if:\nWith limited prosocial emotions: To qualify for this specifier, an individual must have dis-\nplayed at least two of the following characteristics persistently over at least 12 months and\nin multiple relationships and settings. These characteristics reflect the individual’s typical\npattern of interpersonal and emotional functioning over this period and not just occasional\noccurrences in some situations. Thus, to assess the criteria for the specifier, multiple infor-\nmation sources are necessary. In addition to the individual’s self-report, it is necessary to\nconsider reports by others who have known the individual for extended periods of time\n(e.g., parents, teachers, co-workers, extended family members, peers).\nLack of remorse or guilt: Does not feel bad or guilty when he or she does some-\nthing wrong (exclude remorse when expressed only when caught and/or facing\npunishment). The individual shows a general lack of concern about the negative\nconsequences of his or her actions. For example, the individual is not remorseful\nafter hurting someone or does not care about the consequences of breaking rules.\nCallous—lack of empathy: Disregards and is unconcerned about the feelings of\nothers. The individual is described as cold and uncaring. The person appears more\nconcerned about the effects of his or her actions on himself or herself, rather than\ntheir effects on others, even when they result in substantial harm to others.\nConduct Disorder\n471\nUnconcerned about performance: Does not show concern about poor/problem-\natic performance at school, at work, or in other important activities. The individual\ndoes not put forth the effort necessary to perform well, even when expectations are\nclear, and typically blames others for his or her poor performance.\nShallow or deficient affect: Does not express feelings or show emotions to others,\nexcept in ways that seem shallow, insincere, or superficial (e.g., actions contradict the\nemotion displayed; can turn emotions “on” or “off” quickly) or when emotional expres-\nsions are used for gain (e.g., emotions displayed to manipulate or intimidate others).\nSpecify current severity:\nMild: Few if any conduct problems in excess of those required to make the diagnosis\nare present, and conduct problems cause relatively minor harm to others (e.g., lying,\ntruancy, staying out after dark without permission, other rule breaking).\nModerate: The number of conduct problems and the effect on others are intermediate\nbetween those specified in “mild” and those in “severe” (e.g., stealing without confront-\ning a victim, vandalism).\nSevere: Many conduct problems in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are\npresent, or conduct problems cause considerable harm to others (e.g., forced sex, physical\ncruelty, use of a weapon, stealing while confronting a victim, breaking and entering).312.33 (F63.1)\nA. Deliberate and purposeful fire setting on more than one occasion.\nB. Tension or affective arousal before the act.\nC. Fascination with, interest in, curiosity about, or attraction to fire and its situational con-\ntexts (e.g., paraphernalia, uses, consequences).\nD. Pleasure, gratification, or relief when setting fires or when witnessing or participating\nin their aftermath.\nE. The fire setting is not done for monetary gain, as an expression of sociopolitical ideol-\nogy, to conceal criminal activity, to express anger or vengeance, to improve one’s living\ncircumstances, in response to a delusion or hallucination, or as a result of impaired\njudgment (e.g., in major neurocognitive disorder, intellectual disability [intellectual de-\nvelopmental disorder], substance intoxication).\nF. The fire setting is not better explained by conduct disorder, a manic episode, or anti-\nsocial personality disorder.312.32 (F63.2)\nA. Recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal objects that are not needed for personal\nuse or for their monetary value.\nB. Increasing sense of tension immediately before committing the theft.\nC. Pleasure, gratification, or relief at the time of committing the theft.\nD. The stealing is not committed to express anger or vengeance and is not in response\nto a delusion or a hallucination.\nE. The stealing is not better explained by conduct disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial\npersonality disorder.", "subtypes": "In erotomanic type, the central theme of the delusion is that another person is in love with\nthe individual. The person about whom this conviction is held is usually of higher status\n(e.g., a famous individual or a superior at work) but can be a complete stranger. Efforts to\ncontact the object of the delusion are common. In grandiose type, the central theme of the de-\nlusion is the conviction of having some great talent or insight or of having made some im-\nportant discovery. Less commonly, the individual may have the delusion of having a\nspecial relationship with a prominent individual or of being a prominent person (in which\ncase the actual individual may be regarded as an impostor). Grandiose delusions may\nhave a religious content. In jealous type, the central theme of the delusion is that of an un-\nfaithful partner. This belief is arrived at without due cause and is based on incorrect infer-\nences supported by small bits of “evidence” (e.g., disarrayed clothing). The individual\nwith the delusion usually confronts the spouse or lover and attempts to intervene in the\nimagined infidelity. In persecutory type, the central theme of the delusion involves the in-\n92\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\ndividual’s belief of being conspired against, cheated, spied on, followed, poisoned, mali-\nciously maligned, harassed, or obstructed in the pursuit of long-term goals. Small slights\nmay be exaggerated and become the focus of a delusional system. The affected individual\nmay engage in repeated attempts to obtain satisfaction by legal or legislative action. Indi-\nviduals with persecutory delusions are often resentful and angry and may resort to vio-\nlence against those they believe are hurting them. In somatic type, the central theme of the\ndelusion involves bodily functions or sensations. Somatic delusions can occur in several\nforms. Most common is the belief that the individual emits a foul odor; that there is an in-\nfestation of insects on or in the skin; that there is an internal parasite; that certain parts of\nthe body are misshapen or ugly; or that parts of the body are not functioning.Most individuals with the binge-eating/purging type of anorexia nervosa who binge eat\nalso purge through self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas.\nSome individuals with this subtype of anorexia nervosa do not binge eat but do regularly\npurge after the consumption of small amounts of food.\nCrossover between the subtypes over the course of the disorder is not uncommon;\ntherefore, subtype description should be used to describe current symptoms rather than\nlongitudinal course.The nocturnal-only subtype of enuresis, sometimes referred to as monosymptomatic enure-\nsis, is the most common subtype and involves incontinence only during nighttime sleep,\ntypically during the first one-third of the night. The diurnal-only subtype occurs in the\nabsence of nocturnal enuresis and may be referred to simply as urinary incontinence. Indi-\nviduals with this subtype can be divided into two groups. Individuals with “urge incon-\ntinence” have sudden urge symptoms and detrusor instability, whereas individuals with\n“voiding postponement” consciously defer micturition urges until incontinence results.\nThe nocturnal-and-diurnal subtype is also known as nonmonosymptomatic enuresis.Feces in the with constipation and overflow incontinence subtype are characteristically\n(but not invariably) poorly formed, and leakage can be infrequent to continuous, occur-\nring mostly during the day and rarely during sleep. Only part of the feces is passed during\ntoileting, and the incontinence resolves after treatment of the constipation.\nIn the without constipation and overflow incontinence subtype, feces are likely to be of\nnormal form and consistency, and soiling is intermittent. Feces may be deposited in a\nprominent location. This is usually associated with the presence of oppositional defiant\ndisorder or conduct disorder or may be the consequence of anal masturbation. Soiling\nwithout constipation appears to be less common than soiling with constipation.Levin syndrome).\nNarcolepsyIn narcolepsy without cataplexy but with hypocretin deficiency, unclear “cataplexy-like”\nsymptoms may be reported (e.g., the symptoms are not triggered by emotions and are un-\nusually long lasting). In extremely rare cases, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of hypocre-\ntin-1 are low, and polysomnographic/multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) results are\nnegative: repeating the test is advised before establishing the subtype diagnosis. In narco-\n374\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nlepsy with cataplexy but without hypocretin deficiency, test results for human leukocyte\nantigen (HLA) DQB1*06:02 may be negative. Seizures, falls of other origin, and conversion\ndisorder (functional neurological symptom disorder) should be excluded. In narcolepsy\nsecondary to infectious (e.g., Whipple’s disease, sarcoidosis), traumatic, or tumoral de-\nstruction of hypocretin neurons, test results for HLA DQB1*06:02 may be positive and may\nresult from the insult triggering the autoimmune process. In other cases, the destruction of\nhypocretin neurons may be secondary to trauma or hypothalamic surgery. Head trauma\nor infections of the central nervous system can, however, produce transitory decreases in\nCSF hypocretin-1 levels without hypocretin cell loss, complicating the diagnosis.Breathing-Related Sleep Disorders\nThe breathing-related sleep disorders category encompasses three relatively distinct dis-\norders: obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, central sleep apnea, and sleep-related hypo-\nventilation.\nObstructive Sleep Apnea HypopneaIdiopathic central sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes breathing are characterized by increased\ngain of the ventilatory control system, also referred to as high loop gain, which leads to in-\nstability in ventilation and PaCO2 levels. This instability is termed periodic breathing and\ncan be recognized by hyperventilation alternating with hypoventilation. Individuals with\nthese disorders typically have pCO2 levels while awake that are slightly hypocapneic or\nnormocapneic. Central sleep apnea may also manifest during initiation of treatment of ob-\nstructive sleep apnea hypopnea or may occur in association with obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea syndrome (termed complex sleep apnea). The occurrence of central sleep apnea in\nassociation with obstructive sleep apnea is also considered to be due to high loop gain. In\ncontrast, the pathogenesis of central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use has been at-\ntributed to the effects of opioids on the respiratory rhythm generators in the medulla as\nwell as to its differential effects on hypoxic versus hypercapneic respiratory drive. These\nindividuals may have elevated pCO2 levels while awake. Individuals receiving chronic\nmethadone maintenance therapy have been noted to have increased somnolence and de-\npression, although the role of breathing disorders associated with opioid medication in caus-\ning these problems has not been studied.Regarding obesity hypoventilation disorder, the prevalence of obesity hypoventilation in\nthe general population is not known but is thought to be increasing in association with the\nincreased prevalence of obesity and extreme obesity.sleep, resulting in complex behaviors arising from sleep with varying degrees of conscious\nawareness, motor activity, and autonomic activation.\nThe essential feature of sleepwalking is repeated episodes of complex motor behavior\ninitiated during sleep, including rising from bed and walking about (Criterion A1). Sleep-\nwalking episodes begin during any stage of NREM sleep, most commonly during slow-\nwave sleep and therefore most often occurring during the first third of the night. During\nepisodes, the individual has reduced alertness and responsiveness, a blank stare, and rel-\native unresponsiveness to communication with others or efforts by others to awaken the\nindividual. If awakened during the episode (or on awakening the following morning), the\nindividual has limited recall for the episode. After the episode, there may initially be a brief\nperiod of confusion or difficulty orienting, followed by full recovery of cognitive function\nand appropriate behavior.\nThe essential feature of sleep terrors is the repeated occurrence of precipitous awaken-\nings from sleep, usually beginning with a panicky scream or cry (Criterion A2). Sleep ter-\nrors usually begin during the first third of the major sleep episode and last 1–10 minutes,\nbut they may last considerably longer, particularly in children. The episodes are accom-\npanied by impressive autonomic arousal and behavioral manifestations of intense fear.\nDuring an episode, the individual is difficult to awaken or comfort. If the individual awak-\nens after the sleep terror, little or none of the dream, or only fragmentary, single images,\nare recalled. During a typical episode of sleep terrors, the individual abruptly sits up in\nbed screaming or crying, with a frightened expression and autonomic signs of intense anx-\niety (e.g., tachycardia, rapid breathing, sweating, dilation of the pupils). The individual\nmay be inconsolable and is usually unresponsive to the efforts of others to awaken or com-\nfort him or her. Sleep terrors are also called “night terrors” or “pavor nocturnus.”sexual dysfunctions, the time of onset may indicate different etiologies and interventions.\nLifelong refers to a sexual problem that has been present from first sexual experiences, and\nacquired applies to sexual disorders that develop after a period of relatively normal sexual\nfunction. Generalized refers to sexual difficulties that are not limited to certain types of\nstimulation, situations, or partners, and situational refers to sexual difficulties that only oc-\ncur with certain types of stimulation, situations, or partners.\nIn addition to the lifelong/acquired and generalized/situational subtypes, a number\nof factors must be considered during the assessment of sexual dysfunction, given that they\nmay be relevant to etiology and/or treatment, and that may contribute, to varying degrees,\nacross individuals: 1) partner factors (e.g., partner’s sexual problems; partner’s health sta-\ntus); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor communication; discrepancies in desire for sexual\nactivity); 3) individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image; history of sexual or emo-\ntional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression, anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss,\nbereavement); 4) cultural or religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions against\nsexual activity or pleasure; attitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical factors relevant to\nprognosis, course, or treatment.\nClinical judgment about the diagnosis of sexual dysfunction should take into consideration\ncultural factors that may influence expectations or engender prohibitions about the experience\nof sexual pleasure. Aging may be associated with a normative decrease in sexual response.\nSexual response has a requisite biological underpinning, yet is usually experienced in\nan intrapersonal, interpersonal, and cultural context. Thus, sexual function involves a com-\nplex interaction among biological, sociocultural, and psychological factors. In many clinical\ncontexts, a precise understanding of the etiology of a sexual problem is unknown. Nonethe-\nless, a sexual dysfunction diagnosis requires ruling out problems that are better explained\nby a nonsexual mental disorder, by the effects of a substance (e.g., drug or medication), by\na medical condition (e.g., due to pelvic nerve damage), or by severe relationship distress,\npartner violence, or other stressors.\nIf the sexual dysfunction is mostly explainable by another nonsexual mental disorder (e.g.,\ndepressive or bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, psychotic dis-\n424\nSexual Dysfunctions\norder), then only the other mental disorder diagnosis should be made. If the problem is\nthought to be better explained by the use/misuse or discontinuation of a drug or substance, it\nshould be diagnosed accordingly as a substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction. If\nthe sexual dysfunction is attributable to another medical condition (e.g., peripheral neuropa-\nthy), the individual would not receive a psychiatric diagnosis. If severe relationship distress,\npartner violence, or significant stressors better explain the sexual difficulties, then a sexual dys-\nfunction diagnosis is not made, but an appropriate V or Z code for the relationship problem or\nstressor may be listed. In many cases, a precise etiological relationship between another con-\ndition (e.g., a medical condition) and a sexual dysfunction cannot be established.\nDelayed EjaculationThree subtypes of conduct disorder are provided based on the age at onset of the disorder.\nOnset is most accurately estimated with information from both the youth and the care-\ngiver; estimates are often 2 years later than actual onset. Both subtypes can occur in a mild,\nmoderate, or severe form. An unspecified-onset subtype is designated when there is in-\nsufficient information to determine age at onset.\nIn childhood-onset conduct disorder, individuals are usually male, frequently display\nphysical aggression toward others, have disturbed peer relationships, may have had op-\npositional defiant disorder during early childhood, and usually have symptoms that meet\nfull criteria for conduct disorder prior to puberty. Many children with this subtype also\nhave concurrent attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or other neurodevel-\nopmental difficulties. Individuals with childhood-onset type are more likely to have per-\nsistent conduct disorder into adulthood than are those with adolescent-onset type. As\ncompared with individuals with childhood-onset type, individuals with adolescent-onset\nconduct disorder are less likely to display aggressive behaviors and tend to have more\nnormative peer relationships (although they often display conduct problems in the com-\npany of others). These individuals are less likely to have conduct disorder that persists into\nadulthood. The ratio of males to females with conduct disorder is more balanced for the\nadolescent-onset type than for the childhood-onset type.", "specifiers": "The severity of non-self-injurious stereotypic movements ranges from mild presentations\nthat are easily suppressed by a sensory stimulus or distraction to continuous movements\nthat markedly interfere with all activities of daily living. Self-injurious behaviors range in se-\nverity along various dimensions, including the frequency, impact on adaptive functioning,\nand severity of bodily injury (from mild bruising or erythema from hitting hand against\nbody, to lacerations or amputation of digits, to retinal detachment from head banging).The “motor tics only” or “vocal tics only” specifier is only required for persistent (chronic)\nmotor or vocal tic disorder.In addition to the symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the assess-\nment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making critically\nimportant distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic\ndisorders.Specify if:\nWith anxious distress: The presence of at least two of the following symptoms during\nthe majority of days of the current or most recent episode of mania, hypomania, or de-\npression:\n1. Feeling keyed up or tense.\n2. Feeling unusually restless.\n3. Difficulty concentrating because of worry.\n4. Fear that something awful may happen.\n5. Feeling that the individual might lose control of himself or herself.\nSpecify current severity:\nMild: Two symptoms.\nModerate: Three symptoms.\nModerate-severe: Four or five symptoms.\nSevere: Four or five symptoms with motor agitation.\nNote: Anxious distress has been noted as a prominent feature of both bipolar and\nmajor depressive disorder in both primary care and specialty mental health set-\ntings. High levels of anxiety have been associated with higher suicide risk, longer\nduration of illness, and greater likelihood of treatment nonresponse. As a result, it\nis clinically useful to specify accurately the presence and severity levels of anxious\ndistress for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment.\nWith mixed features: The mixed features specifier can apply to the current manic, hy-\npomanic, or depressive episode in bipolar I or bipolar II disorder:\nManic or hypomanic episode, with mixed features:\nA. Full criteria are met for a manic episode or hypomanic episode, and at least\nthree of the following symptoms are present during the majority of days of the\ncurrent or most recent episode of mania or hypomania:\n1. Prominent dysphoria or depressed mood as indicated by either subjective\nreport (e.g., feels sad or empty) or observation made by others (e.g., ap-\npears tearful).\n2. Diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities (as indicated by\neither subjective account or observation made by others).\n3. Psychomotor retardation nearly every day (observable by others; not merely\nsubjective feelings of being slowed down).\n150\nBipolar and Related Disorders\n4. Fatigue or loss of energy.\n5. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (not merely\nself-reproach or guilt about being sick).\n6. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ide-\nation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for com-\nmitting suicide.\nB. Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from the\nperson’s usual behavior.\nC. For individuals whose symptoms meet full episode criteria for both mania and\ndepression simultaneously, the diagnosis should be manic episode, with mixed\nfeatures, due to the marked impairment and clinical severity of full mania.\nD. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a sub-\nstance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment).\nDepressive episode, with mixed features:\nA. Full criteria are met for a major depressive episode, and at least three of the fol-\nlowing manic/hypomanic symptoms are present during the majority of days of\nthe current or most recent episode of depression:\n1. Elevated, expansive mood.\n2. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.\n3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.\n4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.\n5. Increase in energy or goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school,\nor sexually).\n6. Increased or excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential\nfor painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees,\nsexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).\n7. Decreased need for sleep (feeling rested despite sleeping less than usual;\nto be contrasted with insomnia).\nB. Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from the\nperson’s usual behavior.\nC. For individuals whose symptoms meet full episode criteria for both mania and\ndepression simultaneously, the diagnosis should be manic episode, with mixed\nfeatures.\nD. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a sub-\nstance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, or other treatment).\nNote: Mixed features associated with a major depressive episode have been found\nto be a significant risk factor for the development of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder.\nAs a result, it is clinically useful to note the presence of this specifier for treatment\nplanning and monitoring of response to treatment.\nWith rapid cycling (can be applied to bipolar I or bipolar II disorder): Presence of at\nleast four mood episodes in the previous 12 months that meet the criteria for manic,\nhypomanic, or major depressive episode.\nNote: Episodes are demarcated by either partial or full remissions of at least 2 months\nor a switch to an episode of the opposite polarity (e.g., major depressive episode to\nmanic episode).\nNote: The essential feature of a rapid-cycling bipolar disorder is the occurrence of\nat least four mood episodes during the previous 12 months. These episodes can\noccur in any combination and order. The episodes must meet both the duration and151\nsymptom number criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode and\nmust be demarcated by either a period of full remission or a switch to an episode\nof the opposite polarity. Manic and hypomanic episodes are counted as being on\nthe same pole. Except for the fact that they occur more frequently, the episodes that\noccur in a rapid-cycling pattern are no different from those that occur in a non-rapid-\ncycling pattern. Mood episodes that count toward defining a rapid-cycling pattern\nexclude those episodes directly caused by a substance (e.g., cocaine, corticoste-\nroids) or another medical condition.\nWith melancholic features:\nA. One of the following is present during the most severe period of the current episode:\n1. Loss of pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.\n2. Lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli (does not feel much better, even\ntemporarily, when something good happens).\nB. Three (or more) of the following:\n1. A distinct quality of depressed mood characterized by profound despondency,\ndespair, and/or moroseness or by so-called empty mood.\n2. Depression that is regularly worse in the morning.\n3. Early-morning awakening (i.e., at least 2 hours before usual awakening).\n4. Marked psychomotor agitation or retardation.\n5. Significant anorexia or weight loss.\n6. Excessive or inappropriate guilt.\nNote: The specifier “with melancholic features” is applied if these features are pres-\nent at the most severe stage of the episode. There is a near-complete absence of\nthe capacity for pleasure, not merely a diminution. A guideline for evaluating the\nlack of reactivity of mood is that even highly desired events are not associated with\nmarked brightening of mood. Either mood does not brighten at all, or it brightens\nonly partially (e.g., up to 20%–40% of normal for only minutes at a time). The “dis-\ntinct quality” of mood that is characteristic of the “with melancholic features” speci-\nfier is experienced as qualitatively different from that during a nonmelancholic\ndepressive episode. A depressed mood that is described as merely more severe,\nlonger lasting, or present without a reason is not considered distinct in quality. Psy-\nchomotor changes are nearly always present and are observable by others.\nMelancholic features exhibit only a modest tendency to repeat across episodes\nin the same individual. They are more frequent in inpatients, as opposed to outpa-\ntients; are less likely to occur in milder than in more severe major depressive epi-\nsodes; and are more likely to occur in those with psychotic features.\nWith atypical features: This specifier can be applied when these features predomi-\nnate during the majority of days of the current or most recent major depressive epi-\nsode.\nA. Mood reactivity (i.e., mood brightens in response to actual or potential positive\nevents).\nB. Two (or more) of the following features:\n1. Significant weight gain or increase in appetite.\n2. Hypersomnia.\n3. Leaden paralysis (i.e., heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs).\n4. A long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity (not limited to epi-\nsodes of mood disturbance) that results in significant social or occupational\nimpairment.\n152\nBipolar and Related Disorders\nC. Criteria are not met for “with melancholic features” or “with catatonia” during the\nsame episode.\nNote: “Atypical depression” has historical significance (i.e., atypical in contradis-\ntinction to the more classical agitated, “endogenous” presentations of depression\nthat were the norm when depression was rarely diagnosed in outpatients and al-\nmost never in adolescents or younger adults) and today does not connote an un-\ncommon or unusual clinical presentation as the term might imply.\nMood reactivity is the capacity to be cheered up when presented with positive\nevents (e.g., a visit from children, compliments from others). Mood may become\neuthymic (not sad) even for extended periods of time if the external circumstances\nremain favorable. Increased appetite may be manifested by an obvious increase in\nfood intake or by weight gain. Hypersomnia may include either an extended period\nof nighttime sleep or daytime napping that totals at least 10 hours of sleep per day\n(or at least 2 hours more than when not depressed). Leaden paralysis is defined as\nfeeling heavy, leaden, or weighted down, usually in the arms or legs. This sensation\nis generally present for at least an hour a day but often lasts for many hours at a\ntime. Unlike the other atypical features, pathological sensitivity to perceived inter-\npersonal rejection is a trait that has an early onset and persists throughout most of\nadult life. Rejection sensitivity occurs both when the person is and is not depressed,\nthough it may be exacerbated during depressive periods.\nWith psychotic features: Delusions or hallucinations are present at any time in the\nepisode. If psychotic features are present, specify if mood-congruent or mood-incon-\ngruent:\nWith mood-congruent psychotic features: During manic episodes, the con-\ntent of all delusions and hallucinations is consistent with the typical manic\nthemes of grandiosity, invulnerability, etc., but may also include themes of sus-\npiciousness or paranoia, especially with respect to others’ doubts about the in-\ndividual’s capacities, accomplishments, and so forth.\nWith mood-incongruent psychotic features: The content of delusions and\nhallucinations is inconsistent with the episode polarity themes as described\nabove, or the content is a mixture of mood-incongruent and mood-congruent\nthemes.\nWith catatonia: This specifier can apply to an episode of mania or depression if cata-\ntonic features are present during most of the episode. See criteria for catatonia asso-\nciated with a mental disorder in the chapter “Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other\nPsychotic Disorders.”\nWith peripartum onset: This specifier can be applied to the current or, if the full crite-\nria are not currently met for a mood episode, most recent episode of mania, hypoma-\nnia, or major depression in bipolar I or bipolar II disorder if onset of mood symptoms\noccurs during pregnancy or in the 4 weeks following delivery.\nNote: Mood episodes can have their onset either during pregnancy or postpartum.\nAlthough the estimates differ according to the period of follow-up after delivery, be-\ntween 3% and 6% of women will experience the onset of a major depressive epi-\nsode during pregnancy or in the weeks or months following delivery. Fifty percent\nof “postpartum” major depressive episodes actually begin prior to delivery. Thus,\nthese episodes are referred to collectively as peripartum episodes. Women with\nperipartum major depressive episodes often have severe anxiety and even panic\nattacks. Prospective studies have demonstrated that mood and anxiety symptoms\nduring pregnancy, as well as the “baby blues,” increase the risk for a postpartum\nmajor depressive episode.153\nPeripartum-onset mood episodes can present either with or without psychotic\nfeatures. Infanticide is most often associated with postpartum psychotic episodes\nthat are characterized by command hallucinations to kill the infant or delusions that\nthe infant is possessed, but psychotic symptoms can also occur in severe postpar-\ntum mood episodes without such specific delusions or hallucinations.\nPostpartum mood (major depressive or manic) episodes with psychotic features\nappear to occur in from 1 in 500 to 1 in 1,000 deliveries and may be more common\nin primiparous women. The risk of postpartum episodes with psychotic features is\nparticularly increased for women with prior postpartum mood episodes but is also\nelevated for those with a prior history of a depressive or bipolar disorder (especially\nbipolar I disorder) and those with a family history of bipolar disorders.\nOnce a woman has had a postpartum episode with psychotic features, the risk\nof recurrence with each subsequent delivery is between 30% and 50%. Postpartum\nepisodes must be differentiated from delirium occurring in the postpartum period,\nwhich is distinguished by a fluctuating level of awareness or attention. The postpar-\ntum period is unique with respect to the degree of neuroendocrine alterations and\npsychosocial adjustments, the potential impact of breast-feeding on treatment plan-\nning, and the long-term implications of a history of postpartum mood disorder on sub-\nsequent family planning.\nWith seasonal pattern: This specifier applies to the lifetime pattern of mood episodes.\nThe essential feature is a regular seasonal pattern of at least one type of episode (i.e.,\nmania, hypomania, or depression). The other types of episodes may not follow this pat-\ntern. For example, an individual may have seasonal manias, but his or her depressions\ndo not regularly occur at a specific time of year.\nA. There has been a regular temporal relationship between the onset of manic, hypo-\nmanic, or major depressive episodes and a particular time of the year (e.g., in the\nfall or winter) in bipolar I or bipolar II disorder.\nNote: Do not include cases in which there is an obvious effect of seasonally related\npsychosocial stressors (e.g., regularly being unemployed every winter).\nB. Full remissions (or a change from major depression to mania or hypomania or vice\nversa) also occur at a characteristic time of the year (e.g., depression disappears\nin the spring).\nC. In the last 2 years, the individual’s manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episodes\nhave demonstrated a temporal seasonal relationship, as defined above, and no\nnon-seasonal episodes of that polarity have occurred during that 2-year period.\nD. Seasonal manias, hypomanias, or depressions (as described above) substantially\noutnumber any nonseasonal manias, hypomanias, or depressions that may have\noccurred over the individual’s lifetime.\nNote: This specifier can be applied to the pattern of major depressive episodes in\nbipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, or major depressive disorder, recurrent. The\nessential feature is the onset and remission of major depressive episodes at char-\nacteristic times of the year. In most cases, the episodes begin in fall or winter and\nremit in spring. Less commonly, there may be recurrent summer depressive epi-\nsodes. This pattern of onset and remission of episodes must have occurred during\nat least a 2-year period, without any nonseasonal episodes occurring during this\nperiod. In addition, the seasonal depressive episodes must substantially outnum-\nber any nonseasonal depressive episodes over the individual’s lifetime.\nThis specifier does not apply to those situations in which the pattern is better ex-\nplained by seasonally linked psychosocial stressors (e.g., seasonal unemployment\nor school schedule). Major depressive episodes that occur in a seasonal pattern\n154\nBipolar and Related Disorders\nare often characterized by prominent energy, hypersomnia, overeating, weight\ngain, and a craving for carbohydrates. It is unclear whether a seasonal pattern is\nmore likely in recurrent major depressive disorder or in bipolar disorders. However,\nwithin the bipolar disorders group, a seasonal pattern appears to be more likely in\nbipolar II disorder than in bipolar I disorder. In some individuals, the onset of manic\nor hypomanic episodes may also be linked to a particular season.\nThe prevalence of winter-type seasonal pattern appears to vary with latitude,\nage, and sex. Prevalence increases with higher latitudes. Age is also a strong pre-\ndictor of seasonality, with younger persons at higher risk for winter depressive epi-\nsodes.\nSpecify if:\nIn partial remission: Symptoms of the immediately previous manic, hypomanic, or\ndepressive episode are present, but full criteria are not met, or there is a period lasting\nless than 2 months without any significant symptoms of a manic, hypomanic, or major\ndepressive episode following the end of such an episode.\nIn full remission: During the past 2 months, no significant signs or symptoms of the\ndisturbance were present.\nSpecify current severity:\nSeverity is based on the number of criterion symptoms, the severity of those symptoms,\nand the degree of functional disability.\nMild: Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to meet the diagnostic criteria\nare present, the intensity of the symptoms is distressing but manageable, and the\nsymptoms result in minor impairment in social or occupational functioning.\nModerate: The number of symptoms, intensity of symptoms, and/or functional impair-\nment are between those specified for “mild” and “severe.”\nSevere: The number of symptoms is substantially in excess of those required to make\nthe diagnosis, the intensity of the symptoms is seriously distressing and unmanage-\nable, and the symptoms markedly interfere with social and occupational functioning.\n155\nDepressive\nDisorders\nDepressive disorders include disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, major\ndepressive disorder (including major depressive episode), persistent depressive disorder\n(dysthymia), premenstrual dysphoric disorder, substance/medication-induced depres-\nsive disorder, depressive disorder due to another medical condition, other specified de-\npressive disorder, and unspecified depressive disorder. Unlike in DSM-IV, this chapter\n“Depressive Disorders” has been separated from the previous chapter “Bipolar and Re-\nlated Disorders.” The common feature of all of these disorders is the presence of sad,\nempty, or irritable mood, accompanied by somatic and cognitive changes that signifi-\ncantly affect the individual’s capacity to function. What differs among them are issues of\nduration, timing, or presumed etiology.\nIn order to address concerns about the potential for the overdiagnosis of and treatment\nfor bipolar disorder in children, a new diagnosis, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder,\nreferring to the presentation of children with persistent irritability and frequent episodes\nof extreme behavioral dyscontrol, is added to the depressive disorders for children up to\n12 years of age. Its placement in this chapter reflects the finding that children with this\nsymptom pattern typically develop unipolar depressive disorders or anxiety disorders,\nrather than bipolar disorders, as they mature into adolescence and adulthood.\nMajor depressive disorder represents the classic condition in this group of disorders. It\nis characterized by discrete episodes of at least 2 weeks’ duration (although most episodes\nlast considerably longer) involving clear-cut changes in affect, cognition, and neurovege-\ntative functions and inter-episode remissions. A diagnosis based on a single episode is\npossible, although the disorder is a recurrent one in the majority of cases. Careful consid-\neration is given to the delineation of normal sadness and grief from a major depressive ep-\nisode. Bereavement may induce great suffering, but it does not typically induce an episode\nof major depressive disorder. When they do occur together, the depressive symptoms and\nfunctional impairment tend to be more severe and the prognosis is worse compared with\nbereavement that is not accompanied by major depressive disorder. Bereavement-related\ndepression tends to occur in persons with other vulnerabilities to depressive disorders,\nand recovery may be facilitated by antidepressant treatment.\nA more chronic form of depression, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), can be\ndiagnosed when the mood disturbance continues for at least 2 years in adults or 1 year in\nchildren. This diagnosis, new in DSM-5, includes both the DSM-IV diagnostic categories of\nchronic major depression and dysthymia.\nAfter careful scientific review of the evidence, premenstrual dysphoric disorder has\nbeen moved from an appendix of DSM-IV (“Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further\nStudy”) to Section II of DSM-5. Almost 20 years of additional of research on this condition\nhas confirmed a specific and treatment-responsive form of depressive disorder that begins\nsometime following ovulation and remits within a few days of menses and has a marked\nimpact on functioning.\nA large number of substances of abuse, some prescribed medications, and several\nmedical conditions can be associated with depression-like phenomena. This fact is recog-\nnized in the diagnoses of substance/medication-induced depressive disorder and depres-\nsive disorder due to another medical condition.\n156\nDepressive Disorders\nDisruptive Mood Dysregulation DisorderSpecify if:\nWith anxious distress: Anxious distress is defined as the presence of at least two of\nthe following symptoms during the majority of days of a major depressive episode or\npersistent depressive disorder (dysthymia):\n1. Feeling keyed up or tense.\n2. Feeling unusually restless.\n3. Difficulty concentrating because of worry.\n4. Fear that something awful may happen.\n5. Feeling that the individual might lose control of himself or herself.\nSpecify current severity:\nMild: Two symptoms.\nModerate: Three symptoms.\nModerate-severe: Four or five symptoms.\nSevere: Four or five symptoms and with motor agitation.\nNote: Anxious distress has been noted as a prominent feature of both bipolar and ma-\njor depressive disorder in both primary care and specialty mental health settings. High\nlevels of anxiety have been associated with higher suicide risk, longer duration of ill-\nness, and greater likelihood of treatment nonresponse. As a result, it is clinically useful\nto specify accurately the presence and severity levels of anxious distress for treatment\nplanning and monitoring of response to treatment.\nWith mixed features:\nA. At least three of the following manic/hypomanic symptoms are present nearly every\nday during the majority of days of a major depressive episode:\n1. Elevated, expansive mood.\n2. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.\n3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.\n4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.\n5. Increase in energy or goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or\nsexually).185\n6. Increased or excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for\npainful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual in-\ndiscretions, foolish business investments).\n7. Decreased need for sleep (feeling rested despite sleeping less than usual; to be\ncontrasted with insomnia).\nB. Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from the per-\nson’s usual behavior.\nC. For individuals whose symptoms meet full criteria for either mania or hypomania,\nthe diagnosis should be bipolar I or bipolar II disorder.\nD. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance\n(e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication or other treatment).\nNote: Mixed features associated with a major depressive episode have been found\nto be a significant risk factor for the development of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder.\nAs a result, it is clinically useful to note the presence of this specifier for treatment\nplanning and monitoring of response to treatment.\nWith melancholic features:\nA. One of the following is present during the most severe period of the current epi-\nsode:\n1. Loss of pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.\n2. Lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli (does not feel much better, even\ntemporarily, when something good happens).\nB. Three (or more) of the following:\n1. A distinct quality of depressed mood characterized by profound despondency,\ndespair, and/or moroseness or by so-called empty mood.\n2. Depression that is regularly worse in the morning.\n3. Early-morning awakening (i.e., at least 2 hours before usual awakening).\n4. Marked psychomotor agitation or retardation.\n5. Significant anorexia or weight loss.\n6. Excessive or inappropriate guilt.\nNote: The specifier “with melancholic features” is applied if these features are present\nat the most severe stage of the episode. There is a near-complete absence of the ca-\npacity for pleasure, not merely a diminution. A guideline for evaluating the lack of reac-\ntivity of mood is that even highly desired events are not associated with marked\nbrightening of mood. Either mood does not brighten at all, or it brightens only partially\n(e.g., up to 20%–40% of normal for only minutes at a time). The “distinct quality” of mood\nthat is characteristic of the “with melancholic features” specifier is experienced as qual-\nitatively different from that during a nonmelancholic depressive episode. A depressed\nmood that is described as merely more severe, longer lasting, or present without a rea-\nson is not considered distinct in quality. Psychomotor changes are nearly always pres-\nent and are observable by others.\nMelancholic features exhibit only a modest tendency to repeat across episodes in the\nsame individual. They are more frequent in inpatients, as opposed to outpatients; are\nless likely to occur in milder than in more severe major depressive episodes; and are\nmore likely to occur in those with psychotic features.\nWith atypical features: This specifier can be applied when these features predomi-\nnate during the majority of days of the current or most recent major depressive episode\nor persistent depressive disorder.\nA. Mood reactivity (i.e., mood brightens in response to actual or potential positive\nevents).\n186\nDepressive Disorders\nB. Two (or more) of the following:\n1. Significant weight gain or increase in appetite.\n2. Hypersomnia.\n3. Leaden paralysis (i.e., heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs).\n4. A long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity (not limited to epi-\nsodes of mood disturbance) that results in significant social or occupational im-\npairment.\nC. Criteria are not met for “with melancholic features” or “with catatonia” during the\nsame episode.\nNote: “Atypical depression” has historical significance (i.e., atypical in contradistinction\nto the more classical agitated, “endogenous” presentations of depression that were the\nnorm when depression was rarely diagnosed in outpatients and almost never in ado-\nlescents or younger adults) and today does not connote an uncommon or unusual clin-\nical presentation as the term might imply.\nMood reactivity is the capacity to be cheered up when presented with positive events\n(e.g., a visit from children, compliments from others). Mood may become euthymic (not\nsad) even for extended periods of time if the external circumstances remain favorable.\nIncreased appetite may be manifested by an obvious increase in food intake or by\nweight gain. Hypersomnia may include either an extended period of nighttime sleep or\ndaytime napping that totals at least 10 hours of sleep per day (or at least 2 hours more\nthan when not depressed). Leaden paralysis is defined as feeling heavy, leaden, or\nweighted down, usually in the arms or legs. This sensation is generally present for at\nleast an hour a day but often lasts for many hours at a time. Unlike the other atypical\nfeatures, pathological sensitivity to perceived interpersonal rejection is a trait that has\nan early onset and persists throughout most of adult life. Rejection sensitivity occurs\nboth when the person is and is not depressed, though it may be exacerbated during\ndepressive periods.\nWith psychotic features: Delusions and/or hallucinations are present.\nWith mood-congruent psychotic features: The content of all delusions and hal-\nlucinations is consistent with the typical depressive themes of personal inade-\nquacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment.\nWith mood-incongruent psychotic features: The content of the delusions or hal-\nlucinations does not involve typical depressive themes of personal inadequacy,\nguilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment, or the content is a mixture\nof mood-incongruent and mood-congruent themes.\nWith catatonia: The catatonia specifier can apply to an episode of depression if cata-\ntonic features are present during most of the episode. See criteria for catatonia asso-\nciated with a mental disorder (for a description of catatonia, see the chapter\n“Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders”).\nWith peripartum onset: This specifier can be applied to the current or, if full criteria\nare not currently met for a major depressive episode, most recent episode of major de-\npression if onset of mood symptoms occurs during pregnancy or in the 4 weeks follow-\ning delivery.\nNote: Mood episodes can have their onset either during pregnancy or postpartum.\nAlthough the estimates differ according to the period of follow-up after delivery, be-\ntween 3% and 6% of women will experience the onset of a major depressive epi-\nsode during pregnancy or in the weeks or months following delivery. Fifty percent\nof “postpartum” major depressive episodes actually begin prior to delivery. Thus,\nthese episodes are referred to collectively as peripartum episodes. Women with\nperipartum major depressive episodes often have severe anxiety and even panic187\nattacks. Prospective studies have demonstrated that mood and anxiety symptoms\nduring pregnancy, as well as the “baby blues,” increase the risk for a postpartum\nmajor depressive episode.\nPeripartum-onset mood episodes can present either with or without psychotic\nfeatures. Infanticide is most often associated with postpartum psychotic episodes\nthat are characterized by command hallucinations to kill the infant or delusions that\nthe infant is possessed, but psychotic symptoms can also occur in severe postpar-\ntum mood episodes without such specific delusions or hallucinations.\nPostpartum mood (major depressive or manic) episodes with psychotic features\nappear to occur in from 1 in 500 to 1 in 1,000 deliveries and may be more common\nin primiparous women. The risk of postpartum episodes with psychotic features is\nparticularly increased for women with prior postpartum mood episodes but is also\nelevated for those with a prior history of a depressive or bipolar disorder (especially\nbipolar I disorder) and those with a family history of bipolar disorders.\nOnce a woman has had a postpartum episode with psychotic features, the risk\nof recurrence with each subsequent delivery is between 30% and 50%. Postpartum\nepisodes must be differentiated from delirium occurring in the postpartum period,\nwhich is distinguished by a fluctuating level of awareness or attention. The postpar-\ntum period is unique with respect to the degree of neuroendocrine alterations and\npsychosocial adjustments, the potential impact of breast-feeding on treatment\nplanning, and the long-term implications of a history of postpartum mood disorder\non subsequent family planning.\nWith seasonal pattern: This specifier applies to recurrent major depressive disorder.\nA. There has been a regular temporal relationship between the onset of major depres-\nsive episodes in major depressive disorder and a particular time of the year (e.g.,\nin the fall or winter).\nNote: Do not include cases in which there is an obvious effect of seasonally related\npsychosocial stressors (e.g., regularly being unemployed every winter).\nB. Full remissions (or a change from major depression to mania or hypomania) also\noccur at a characteristic time of the year (e.g., depression disappears in the spring).\nC. In the last 2 years, two major depressive episodes have occurred that demonstrate\nthe temporal seasonal relationships defined above and no nonseasonal major de-\npressive episodes have occurred during that same period.\nD. Seasonal major depressive episodes (as described above) substantially outnum-\nber the nonseasonal major depressive episodes that may have occurred over the\nindividual’s lifetime.\nNote: The specifier “with seasonal pattern” can be applied to the pattern of major de-\npressive episodes in major depressive disorder, recurrent. The essential feature is the\nonset and remission of major depressive episodes at characteristic times of the year.\nIn most cases, the episodes begin in fall or winter and remit in spring. Less commonly,\nthere may be recurrent summer depressive episodes. This pattern of onset and remis-\nsion of episodes must have occurred during at least a 2-year period, without any non-\nseasonal episodes occurring during this period. In addition, the seasonal depressive\nepisodes must substantially outnumber any nonseasonal depressive episodes over\nthe individual’s lifetime.\nThis specifier does not apply to those situations in which the pattern is better ex-\nplained by seasonally linked psychosocial stressors (e.g., seasonal unemployment or\nschool schedule). Major depressive episodes that occur in a seasonal pattern are often\ncharacterized by prominent energy, hypersomnia, overeating, weight gain, and a crav-\ning for carbohydrates. It is unclear whether a seasonal pattern is more likely in recur-\nrent major depressive disorder or in bipolar disorders. However, within the bipolar\ndisorders group, a seasonal pattern appears to be more likely in bipolar II disorder than\n188\nDepressive Disorders\nin bipolar I disorder. In some individuals, the onset of manic or hypomanic episodes\nmay also be linked to a particular season.\nThe prevalence of winter-type seasonal pattern appears to vary with latitude, age,\nand sex. Prevalence increases with higher latitudes. Age is also a strong predictor of\nseasonality, with younger persons at higher risk for winter depressive episodes.\nSpecify if:\nIn partial remission: Symptoms of the immediately previous major depressive episode\nare present, but full criteria are not met, or there is a period lasting less than 2 months\nwithout any significant symptoms of a major depressive episode following the end of\nsuch an episode.\nIn full remission: During the past 2 months, no significant signs or symptoms of the\ndisturbance were present.\nSpecify current severity:\nSeverity is based on the number of criterion symptoms, the severity of those symptoms,\nand the degree of functional disability.\nMild: Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are\npresent, the intensity of the symptoms is distressing but manageable, and the symp-\ntoms result in minor impairment in social or occupational functioning.\nModerate: The number of symptoms, intensity of symptoms, and/or functional impair-\nment are between those specified for “mild” and “severe.”\nSevere: The number of symptoms is substantially in excess of that required to make\nthe diagnosis, the intensity of the symptoms is seriously distressing and unmanage-\nable, and the symptoms markedly interfere with social and occupational functioning.\n189\nAnxiety\nDisorders\nAnxiety disorders include disorders that share features of excessive fear and anxi-\nety and related behavioral disturbances. Fear is the emotional response to real or per-\nceived imminent threat, whereas anxiety is anticipation of future threat. Obviously, these\ntwo states overlap, but they also differ, with fear more often associated with surges of au-\ntonomic arousal necessary for fight or flight, thoughts of immediate danger, and escape\nbehaviors, and anxiety more often associated with muscle tension and vigilance in prep-\naration for future danger and cautious or avoidant behaviors. Sometimes the level of fear\nor anxiety is reduced by pervasive avoidance behaviors. Panic attacks feature prominently\nwithin the anxiety disorders as a particular type of fear response. Panic attacks are not lim-\nited to anxiety disorders but rather can be seen in other mental disorders as well.\nThe anxiety disorders differ from one another in the types of objects or situations that\ninduce fear, anxiety, or avoidance behavior, and the associated cognitive ideation. Thus,\nwhile the anxiety disorders tend to be highly comorbid with each other, they can be dif-\nferentiated by close examination of the types of situations that are feared or avoided and\nthe content of the associated thoughts or beliefs.\nAnxiety disorders differ from developmentally normative fear or anxiety by being ex-\ncessive or persisting beyond developmentally appropriate periods. They differ from tran-\nsient fear or anxiety, often stress-induced, by being persistent (e.g., typically lasting 6 months\nor more), although the criterion for duration is intended as a general guide with allowance\nfor some degree of flexibility and is sometimes of shorter duration in children (as in sepa-\nration anxiety disorder and selective mutism). Since individuals with anxiety disorders\ntypically overestimate the danger in situations they fear or avoid, the primary determina-\ntion of whether the fear or anxiety is excessive or out of proportion is made by the clinician,\ntaking cultural contextual factors into account. Many of the anxiety disorders develop in\nchildhood and tend to persist if not treated. Most occur more frequently in females than in\nmales (approximately 2:1 ratio). Each anxiety disorder is diagnosed only when the symp-\ntoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance/medication or to another\nmedical condition or are not better explained by another mental disorder.\nThe chapter is arranged developmentally, with disorders sequenced according to the\ntypical age at onset. The individual with separation anxiety disorder is fearful or anxious\nabout separation from attachment figures to a degree that is developmentally inappro-\npriate. There is persistent fear or anxiety about harm coming to attachment figures and\nevents that could lead to loss of or separation from attachment figures and reluctance to go\naway from attachment figures, as well as nightmares and physical symptoms of distress. Al-\nthough the symptoms often develop in childhood, they can be expressed throughout adult-\nhood as well.\nSelective mutism is characterized by a consistent failure to speak in social situations in\nwhich there is an expectation to speak (e.g., school) even though the individual speaks in\nother situations. The failure to speak has significant consequences on achievement in aca-\ndemic or occupational settings or otherwise interferes with normal social communication.\nIndividuals with specific phobia are fearful or anxious about or avoidant of circum-\nscribed objects or situations. A specific cognitive ideation is not featured in this disorder,\nas it is in other anxiety disorders. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is almost always imme-\n190\nAnxiety Disorders\ndiately induced by the phobic situation, to a degree that is persistent and out of proportion\nto the actual risk posed. There are various types of specific phobias: animal; natural envi-\nronment; blood-injection-injury; situational; and other situations.\nIn social anxiety disorder (social phobia), the individual is fearful or anxious about or\navoidant of social interactions and situations that involve the possibility of being scruti-\nnized. These include social interactions such as meeting unfamiliar people, situations in\nwhich the individual may be observed eating or drinking, and situations in which the in-\ndividual performs in front of others. The cognitive ideation is of being negatively evalu-\nated by others, by being embarrassed, humiliated, or rejected, or offending others.\nIn panic disorder, the individual experiences recurrent unexpected panic attacks and is\npersistently concerned or worried about having more panic attacks or changes his or her\nbehavior in maladaptive ways because of the panic attacks (e.g., avoidance of exercise or of\nunfamiliar locations). Panic attacks are abrupt surges of intense fear or intense discomfort\nthat reach a peak within minutes, accompanied by physical and/or cognitive symptoms.\nLimited-symptom panic attacks include fewer than four symptoms. Panic attacks may be\nexpected, such as in response to a typically feared object or situation, or unexpected, meaning\nthat the panic attack occurs for no apparent reason. Panic attacks function as a marker and\nprognostic factor for severity of diagnosis, course, and comorbidity across an array of dis-\norders, including, but not limited to, the anxiety disorders (e.g., substance use, depressive\nand psychotic disorders). Panic attack may therefore be used as a descriptive specifier for\nany anxiety disorder as well as other mental disorders.\nIndividuals with agoraphobia are fearful and anxious about two or more of the follow-\ning situations: using public transportation; being in open spaces; being in enclosed places;\nstanding in line or being in a crowd; or being outside of the home alone in other situations.\nThe individual fears these situations because of thoughts that escape might be difficult or\nhelp might not be available in the event of developing panic-like symptoms or other inca-\npacitating or embarrassing symptoms. These situations almost always induce fear or anx-\niety and are often avoided and require the presence of a companion.\nThe key features of generalized anxiety disorder are persistent and excessive anxiety\nand worry about various domains, including work and school performance, that the indi-\nvidual finds difficult to control. In addition, the individual experiences physical symptoms,\nincluding restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge; being easily fatigued; difficulty con-\ncentrating or mind going blank; irritability; muscle tension; and sleep disturbance.\nSubstance/medication-induced anxiety disorder involves anxiety due to substance in-\ntoxication or withdrawal or to a medication treatment. In anxiety disorder due to another\nmedical condition, anxiety symptoms are the physiological consequence of another med-\nical condition.\nDisorder-specific scales are available to better characterize the severity of each anxiety\ndisorder and to capture change in severity over time. For ease of use, particularly for in-\ndividuals with more than one anxiety disorder, these scales have been developed to have\nthe same format (but different focus) across the anxiety disorders, with ratings of behav-\nioral symptoms, cognitive ideation symptoms, and physical symptoms relevant to each\ndisorder.\nSeparation Anxiety DisorderIt is common for individuals to have multiple specific phobias. The average individual with\nspecific phobia fears three objects or situations, and approximately 75% of individuals with\nspecific phobia fear more than one situation or object. In such cases, multiple specific phobia\ndiagnoses, each with its own diagnostic code reflecting the phobic stimulus, would need to be\ngiven. For example, if an individual fears thunderstorms and flying, then two diagnoses\nwould be given: specific phobia, natural environment, and specific phobia, situational.Individuals with the performance only type of social anxiety disorder have performance\nfears that are typically most impairing in their professional lives (e.g., musicians, dancers,\nperformers, athletes) or in roles that require regular public speaking. Performance fears\nmay also manifest in work, school, or academic settings in which regular public presenta-\ntions are required. Individuals with performance only social anxiety disorder do not fear\nor avoid nonperformance social situations.Many individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have dysfunctional beliefs.\nThese beliefs can include an inflated sense of responsibility and the tendency to overesti-\nmate threat; perfectionism and intolerance of uncertainty; and over-importance of thoughts\n(e.g., believing that having a forbidden thought is as bad as acting on it) and the need to\ncontrol thoughts.\nIndividuals with OCD vary in the degree of insight they have about the accuracy of the\nbeliefs that underlie their obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Many individuals have good or\nfair insight (e.g., the individual believes that the house definitely will not, probably will not,\nor may or may not burn down if the stove is not checked 30 times). Some have poor insight\n(e.g., the individual believes that the house will probably burn down if the stove is not\nchecked 30 times), and a few (4% or less) have absent insight/delusional beliefs (e.g., the in-\ndividual is convinced that the house will burn down if the stove is not checked 30 times).\nInsight can vary within an individual over the course of the illness. Poorer insight has been\nlinked to worse long-term outcome.\nUp to 30% of individuals with OCD have a lifetime tic disorder. This is most common\nin males with onset of OCD in childhood. These individuals tend to differ from those with-\nout a history of tic disorders in the themes of their OCD symptoms, comorbidity, course,\nand pattern of familial transmission.With excessive acquisition.\nApproximately 80%–90% of individuals with hoarding\ndisorder display excessive acquisition. The most frequent form of acquisition is excessive\nbuying, followed by acquisition of free items (e.g., leaflets, items discarded by others).\nStealing is less common. Some individuals may deny excessive acquisition when first as-\nsessed, yet it may appear later during the course of treatment. Individuals with hoarding\ndisorder typically experience distress if they are unable to or are prevented from acquiring\nitems.Disease severity is measured by a count of the number of apneas plus hypopneas per hour\nof sleep (apnea hypopnea index) using polysomnography or other overnight monitoring.\nOverall severity is also informed by levels of nocturnal desaturation and sleep fragmen-\ntation (measured by brain cortical arousal frequency and sleep stages) and degree of as-\nsociated symptoms and daytime impairment. However, the exact number and thresholds\nmay vary according to the specific measurement techniques used, and these numbers may\nchange over time. Regardless of the apnea hypopnea index (count) per se, the disorder is\nconsidered to be more severe when apneas and hypopneas are accompanied by significant\noxygen hemoglobin desaturation (e.g., when more than 10% of the sleep time is spent at\ndesaturation levels of less than 90%) or when sleep is severely fragmented as shown by an\nObstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea\n379\nelevated arousal index (arousal index greater than 30) or reduced stages in deep sleep (e.g.,\npercentage stage N3 [slow-wave sleep] less than 5%).An increase in the central apnea index (i.e., number of central apneas per hour of sleep) re-\nflects an increase in severity of central sleep apnea. Sleep continuity and quality may be\nmarkedly impaired with reductions in restorative stages of non–rapid eye movement (REM)\nsleep (i.e., decreased slow-wave sleep [stage N3]). In individuals with severe Cheyne-\nStokes breathing, the pattern can also be observed during resting wakefulness, a finding\nthat is thought to be a poor prognostic marker for mortality.Advanced sleep phase type may be documented with the specified “familial.” Although\nthe prevalence of familial advanced sleep phase type has not been established, a family\nhistory of advanced sleep phase is present in individuals with advanced sleep phase type.\nIn this type, specific mutations demonstrate an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.\nIn the familial form, onset of symptoms may occur earlier (during childhood and early\nadulthood), the course is persistent, and the severity of symptoms may increase with age.The posttransition specifier may be used in the context of continuing treatment procedures\nthat serve to support the new gender assignment.It is not uncommon for individuals with oppositional defiant disorder to show symptoms\nonly at home and only with family members. However, the pervasiveness of the symp-\ntoms is an indicator of the severity of the disorder.A minority of individuals with conduct disorder exhibit characteristics that qualify for the\n“with limited prosocial emotions” specifier. The indicators of this specifier are those that\nhave often been labeled as callous and unemotional traits in research. Other personality\nfeatures, such as thrill seeking, fearlessness, and insensitivity to punishment, may also dis-\ntinguish those with characteristics described in the specifier. Individuals with character-\nistics described in this specifier may be more likely than other individuals with conduct\ndisorder to engage in aggression that is planned for instrumental gain. Individuals with\nconduct disorder of any subtype or any level of severity can have characteristics that qual-\nify for the specifier “with limited prosocial emotions,” although individuals with the spec-\nifier are more likely to have childhood-onset type and a severity specifier rating of severe.\n472\nDisruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders\nAlthough the validity of self-report to assess the presence of the specifier has been sup-\nported in some research contexts, individuals with conduct disorder with this specifier\nmay not readily admit to the traits in a clinical interview. Thus, to assess the criteria for the\nspecifier, multiple information sources are necessary. Also, because the indicators of the\nspecifier are characteristics that reflect the individual’s typical pattern of interpersonal and\nemotional functioning, it is important to consider reports by others who have known the\nindividual for extended periods of time and across relationships and settings (e.g., par-\nents, teachers, co-workers, extended family members, peers).", "recording_procedures": "Each impaired academic domain and subskill of specific learning disorder should be re-\ncorded. Because of ICD coding requirements, impairments in reading, impairments in writ-\nten expression, and impairments in mathematics, with their corresponding impairments in\nsubskills, must be coded separately. For example, impairments in reading and mathematics\nand impairments in the subskills of reading rate or fluency, reading comprehension, accu-\nrate or fluent calculation, and accurate math reasoning would be coded and recorded as\n315.00 (F81.0) specific learning disorder with impairment in reading, with impairment in\nreading rate or fluency and impairment in reading comprehension; 315.1 (F81.2) specific\nlearning disorder with impairment in mathematics, with impairment in accurate or fluent\ncalculation and impairment in accurate math reasoning.For stereotypic movement disorder that is associated with a known medical or genetic\ncondition, neurodevelopmental disorder, or environmental factor, record stereotypic\nmovement disorder associated with (name of condition, disorder, or factor) (e.g., stereo-\ntypic movement disorder associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome).ICD-9-CM.\nThe name of the substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder begins\nwith the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing\nthe delusions or hallucinations.

For example, in the case of\ninsomnia occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe lorazepam use disorder, the\ndiagnosis is F13.282 severe lorazepam use disorder with lorazepam-induced sleep disor-\nder, with onset during withdrawal, insomnia type. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid\nsevere lorazepam use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced sleep disorder occurs\nwithout a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., with medication use), no accompanying\nsubstance use disorder is noted (e.g., F19.982 bupropion-induced sleep disorder, with on-\nset during medication use, insomnia type). When more than one substance is judged to\nplay a significant role in the development of the sleep disturbance, each should be listed\nseparately (e.g., F10.282 severe alcohol use disorder with alcohol-induced sleep disorder,\nwith onset during intoxication, insomnia type; F14.282 severe cocaine use disorder with\ncocaine-induced sleep disorder, with onset during intoxication, insomnia type).ICD-9-CM.\nThe name of the substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction begins\nwith the specific substance (e.g., alcohol, fluoxetine) that is presumed to be causing the\nsexual dysfunction. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria\nset, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes\n(e.g., fluoxetine), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a\nsubstance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is un-\nknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used.\nThe name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during in-\ntoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset after medication use), followed by the se-\nverity specifier (e.g., mild, moderate, severe). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-\nCM, which combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a sin-\ngle code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder.\nFor example, in the case of erectile dysfunction occurring during intoxication in a man\nwith a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is 291.89 alcohol-induced sexual dysfunc-\ntion, with onset during intoxication, moderate. An additional diagnosis of 303.90 severe\nalcohol use disorder is also given.

The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria\nset, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use\ndisorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., fluoxetine), the code for\n“other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an eti-\nological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown sub-\nstance” should be used.\nWhen recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any)\nis listed first, followed by the word “with,” followed by the name of the substance-induced\nsexual dysfunction, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication,\nonset during withdrawal, with onset after medication use), followed by the severity spec-\nifier (e.g., mild, moderate, severe). For example, in the case of erectile dysfunction occur-\nring during intoxication in a man with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is\nF10.281 moderate alcohol use disorder with alcohol-induced sexual dysfunction, with on-\nset during intoxication, moderate. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe alcohol use\ndisorder is not given. If the substance-induced sexual dysfunction occurs without a co-\nmorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no ac-\ncompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F15.981 amphetamine-induced sexual\ndysfunction, with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to\nplay a significant role in the development of the sexual dysfunction, each should be listed\nseparately (e.g., F14.181 mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced sexual dysfunc-\ntion, with onset during intoxication, moderate; F19.981 fluoxetine-induced sexual dys-\nfunction, with onset after medication use, moderate).The clinician should use the code that applies to the class of substances but record the\nname of the specific substance. For example, the clinician should record 304.10 (F13.20)\nmoderate alprazolam use disorder (rather than moderate sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic\nuse disorder) or 305.70 (F15.10) mild methamphetamine use disorder (rather than mild\nstimulant use disorder). For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., anabolic\nsteroids), the appropriate code for “other substance use disorder” should be used and the\nspecific substance indicated (e.g., 305.90 [F19.10] mild anabolic steroid use disorder). If the\nsubstance taken by the individual is unknown, the code for the class “other (or unknown)”\nshould be used (e.g., 304.90 [F19.20] severe unknown substance use disorder). If criteria\nare met for more than one substance use disorder, all should be diagnosed (e.g., 304.00\n[F11.20] severe heroin use disorder; 304.20 [F14.20] moderate cocaine use disorder).\nThe appropriate ICD-10-CM code for a substance use disorder depends on whether\nthere is a comorbid substance-induced disorder (including intoxication and withdrawal). In\nthe above example, the diagnostic code for moderate alprazolam use disorder, F13.20, re-\nflects the absence of a comorbid alprazolam-induced mental disorder. Because ICD-10-CM\ncodes for substance-induced disorders indicate both the presence (or absence) and severity\nof the substance use disorder, ICD-10-CM codes for substance use disorders can be used\nonly in the absence of a substance-induced disorder. See the individual substance-specific\nsections for additional coding information.\nNote that the word addiction is not applied as a diagnostic term in this classification,\nalthough it is in common usage in many countries to describe severe problems related to\ncompulsive and habitual use of substances. The more neutral term substance use disorder is\nused to describe the wide range of the disorder, from a mild form to a severe state of chron-\nically relapsing, compulsive drug taking. Some clinicians will choose to use the word ad-\ndiction to describe more extreme presentations, but the word is omitted from the official\nDSM-5 substance use disorder diagnostic terminology because of its uncertain definition\nand its potentially negative connotation.\nSubstance-Induced Disorders\nThe overall category of substance-induced disorders includes intoxication, withdrawal,\nand other substance/medication-induced mental disorders (e.g., substance-induced psy-\nchotic disorder, substance-induced depressive disorder).\nSubstance Intoxication and Withdrawal\nCriteria for substance intoxication are included within the substance-specific sections of\nthis chapter. The essential feature is the development of a reversible substance-specific\nsyndrome due to the recent ingestion of a substance (Criterion A). The clinically significant\nproblematic behavioral or psychological changes associated with intoxication (e.g., bellig-\nerence, mood lability, impaired judgment) are attributable to the physiological effects of\nthe substance on the central nervous system and develop during or shortly after use of the\nsubstance (Criterion B). The symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition\nand are not better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion D). Substance intoxi-\ncation is common among those with a substance use disorder but also occurs frequently in\nindividuals without a substance use disorder. This category does not apply to tobacco.\nThe most common changes in intoxication involve disturbances of perception, wake-\nfulness, attention, thinking, judgment, psychomotor behavior, and interpersonal behav-\nior. Short-term, or “acute,” intoxications may have different signs and symptoms than\n486\nSubstance-Related and Addictive Disorders\nsustained, or “chronic,” intoxications. For example, moderate cocaine doses may initially\nproduce gregariousness, but social withdrawal may develop if such doses are frequently\nrepeated over days or weeks.\nWhen used in the physiological sense, the term intoxication is broader than substance\nintoxication as defined here. Many substances may produce physiological or psychologi-\ncal changes that are not necessarily problematic. For example, an individual with tachy-\ncardia from substance use has a physiological effect, but if this is the only symptom in the\nabsence of problematic behavior, the diagnosis of intoxication would not apply. Intoxica-\ntion may sometimes persist beyond the time when the substance is detectable in the body.\nThis may be due to enduring central nervous system effects, the recovery of which takes\nlonger than the time for elimination of the substance. These longer-term effects of intoxi-\ncation must be distinguished from withdrawal (i.e., symptoms initiated by a decline in\nblood or tissue concentrations of a substance).\nCriteria for substance withdrawal are included within the substance-specific sections of\nthis chapter. The essential feature is the development of a substance-specific problematic be-\nhavioral change, with physiological and cognitive concomitants, that is due to the cessation of,\nor reduction in, heavy and prolonged substance use (Criterion A). The substance-specific syn-\ndrome causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other im-\nportant areas of functioning (Criterion C). The symptoms are not due to another medical\ncondition and are not better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion D). Withdrawal\nis usually, but not always, associated with a substance use disorder. Most individuals with\nwithdrawal have an urge to re-administer the substance to reduce the symptoms.\nRoute of Administration and Speed of Substance Effects\nRoutes of administration that produce more rapid and efficient absorption into the blood-\nstream (e.g., intravenous, smoking, intranasal “snorting”) tend to result in a more intense\nintoxication and an increased likelihood of an escalating pattern of substance use leading\nto withdrawal. Similarly, rapidly acting substances are more likely than slower-acting\nsubstances to produce immediate intoxication.\nDuration of Effects\nWithin the same drug category, relatively short-acting substances tend to have a higher\npotential for the development of withdrawal than do those with a longer duration of ac-\ntion. However, longer-acting substances tend to have longer withdrawal duration. The\nhalf-life of the substance parallels aspects of withdrawal: the longer the duration of action,\nthe longer the time between cessation and the onset of withdrawal symptoms and the lon-\nger the withdrawal duration. In general, the longer the acute withdrawal period, the less\nintense the syndrome tends to be.\nUse of Multiple Substances\nSubstance intoxication and withdrawal often involve several substances used simultane-\nously or sequentially. In these cases, each diagnosis should be recorded separately.\nAssociated Laboratory Findings\nLaboratory analyses of blood and urine samples can help determine recent use and the specific\nsubstances involved. However, a positive laboratory test result does not by itself indicate that\nthe individual has a pattern of substance use that meets criteria for a substance-induced or sub-\nstance use disorder, and a negative test result does not by itself rule out a diagnosis.\nLaboratory tests can be useful in identifying withdrawal. If the individual presents\nwith withdrawal from an unknown substance, laboratory tests may help identify the sub-\nstance and may also be helpful in differentiating withdrawal from other mental disorders.\nSubstance-Induced Disorders\n487\nIn addition, normal functioning in the presence of high blood levels of a substance sug-\ngests considerable tolerance.The clinician should use the code that applies to the class of substances but record the\nname of the specific substance. For example, the clinician should record 292.0 (F13.239) seco-\nbarbital withdrawal (rather than sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal) or 292.89\n(F15.129) methamphetamine intoxication (rather than stimulant intoxication). Note that\nthe appropriate ICD-10-CM diagnostic code for intoxication depends on whether there is\na comorbid substance use disorder. In this case, the F15.129 code for methamphetamine in-\ndicates the presence of a comorbid mild methamphetamine use disorder. If there had been\nno comorbid methamphetamine use disorder, the diagnostic code would have been\nF15.929. ICD-10-CM coding rules require that all withdrawal codes imply a comorbid\nmoderate to severe substance use disorder for that substance. In the above case, the code\nfor secobarbital withdrawal (F13.239) indicates the comorbid presence of a moderate to se-\nvere secobarbital use disorder. See the coding note for the substance-specific intoxication\nand withdrawal syndromes for the actual coding options.\nFor substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., anabolic steroids), the appropriate\ncode for “other substance intoxication” should be used and the specific substance indicated\n(e.g., 292.89 [F19.929] anabolic steroid intoxication). If the substance taken by the individual is\nunknown, the code for the class “other (or unknown)” should be used (e.g., 292.89 [F19.929]\nunknown substance intoxication). If there are symptoms or problems associated with a partic-\nular substance but criteria are not met for any of the substance-specific disorders, the unspec-\nified category can be used (e.g., 292.9 [F12.99] unspecified cannabis-related disorder).\nAs noted above, the substance-related codes in ICD-10-CM combine the substance use dis-\norder aspect of the clinical picture and the substance-induced aspect into a single combined\ncode. Thus, if both heroin withdrawal and moderate heroin use disorder are present, the single\ncode F11.23 is given to cover both presentations. In ICD-9-CM, separate diagnostic codes\n(292.0 and 304.00) are given to indicate withdrawal and a moderate heroin use disorder, re-\nspectively. See the individual substance-specific sections for additional coding information.\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Mental Disorders\nThe substance/medication-induced mental disorders are potentially severe, usually tem-\nporary, but sometimes persisting central nervous system (CNS) syndromes that develop\nin the context of the effects of substances of abuse, medications, or several toxins. They are\ndistinguished from the substance use disorders, in which a cluster of cognitive, behav-\nioral, and physiological symptoms contribute to the continued use of a substance despite\nsignificant substance-related problems. The substance/medication-induced mental disor-\nders may be induced by the 10 classes of substances that produce substance use disorders,\nor by a great variety of other medications used in medical treatment. Each substance-\ninduced mental disorder is described in the relevant chapter (e.g., “Depressive Disorders,”\n“Neurocognitive Disorders”), and therefore, only a brief description is offered here. All\nsubstance/medication-induced disorders share common characteristics. It is important to\nrecognize these common features to aid in the detection of these disorders. These features\nare described as follows:\n488\nSubstance-Related and Addictive Disorders\nA. The disorder represents a clinically significant symptomatic presentation of a relevant\nmental disorder.\nB. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of\nboth of the following:\n1. The disorder developed during or within 1 month of a substance intoxication or\nwithdrawal or taking a medication; and\n2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the mental disorder.\nC. The disorder is not better explained by an independent mental disorder (i.e., one that is\nnot substance- or medication-induced). Such evidence of an independent mental dis-\norder could include the following:\n1. The disorder preceded the onset of severe intoxication or withdrawal or exposure\nto the medication; or\n2. The full mental disorder persisted for a substantial period of time (e.g., at least 1 month)\nafter the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication or taking the medica-\ntion. This criterion does not apply to substance-induced neurocognitive disorders\nor hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, which persist beyond the cessation\nof acute intoxication or withdrawal.\nD. The disorder does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.\nE. The disorder causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning.\nFeatures\nSome generalizations can be made regarding the categories of substances capable of produc-\ning clinically relevant substance-induced mental disorders. In general, the more sedating\ndrugs (sedative, hypnotics, or anxiolytics, and alcohol) can produce prominent and clini-\ncally significant depressive disorders during intoxication, while anxiety conditions are likely\nto be observed during withdrawal syndromes from these substances. Also, during intoxica-\ntion, the more stimulating substances (e.g., amphetamines and cocaine) are likely to be as-\nsociated with substance-induced psychotic disorders and substance-induced anxiety\ndisorders, with substance-induced major depressive episodes observed during withdrawal.\nBoth the more sedating and more stimulating drugs are likely to produce significant but\ntemporary sleep and sexual disturbances. An overview of the relationship between specific\ncategories of substances and specific psychiatric syndromes is presented in Table 1.\nThe medication-induced conditions include what are often idiosyncratic CNS reac-\ntions or relatively extreme examples of side effects for a wide range of medications taken\nfor a variety of medical concerns. These include neurocognitive complications of anesthet-\nics, antihistamines, antihypertensives, and a variety of other medications and toxins (e.g.,\norganophosphates, insecticides, carbon monoxide), as described in the chapter on neuro-\ncognitive disorders. Psychotic syndromes may be temporarily experienced in the context\nof anticholinergic, cardiovascular, and steroid drugs, as well as during use of stimulant-\nlike and depressant-like prescription or over-the-counter drugs. Temporary but severe\nmood disturbances can be observed with a wide range of medications, including steroids,\nantihypertensives, disulfiram, and any prescription or over-the-counter depressant or\nstimulant-like substances. A similar range of medications can be associated with tempo-\nrary anxiety syndromes, sexual dysfunctions, and conditions of disturbed sleep.\nIn general, to be considered a substance/medication-induced mental disorder, there\nmust be evidence that the disorder being observed is not likely to be better explained by an\nindependent mental condition. The latter are most likely to be seen if the mental disorder\nwas present before the severe intoxication or withdrawal or medication administration, or,\nwith the exception of several substance-induced persisting disorders listed in Table 1, con-\ntinued more than 1 month after cessation of acute withdrawal, severe intoxication, or use\nSubstance-Induced Disorders\n489\nof the medications. When symptoms are only observed during a delirium (e.g., alcohol\nwithdrawal delirium), the mental disorder should be diagnosed as a delirium, and the\npsychiatric syndrome occurring during the delirium should not also be diagnosed sepa-\nrately, as many symptoms (including disturbances in mood, anxiety, and reality testing)\nare commonly seen during agitated, confused states. The features associated with each rel-\nevant major mental disorder are similar whether observed with independent or sub-\nstance/medication-induced mental disorders. However, individuals with substance/\nmedication-induced mental disorders are likely to also demonstrate the associated fea-\ntures seen with the specific category of substance or medication, as listed in other subsec-\ntions of this chapter.Induced Mental Disorders\nCoding notes and separate recording procedures for ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for\nother specific substance/medication-induced mental disorders are provided in other\nchapters of the manual with disorders with which they share phenomenology (see the sub-\nstance/medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters: “Schizophrenia Spectrum\nand Other Psychotic Disorders,” “Bipolar and Related Disorders,” “Depressive Disor-\nders,” “Anxiety Disorders,” “Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders,” “Sleep-\nWake Disorders,” “Sexual Dysfunctions,” and “Neurocognitive Disorders”). Generally,\nfor ICD-9-CM, if a mental disorder is induced by a substance use disorder, a separate di-\nagnostic code is given for the specific substance use disorder, in addition to the code for the\nsubstance/medication-induced mental disorder. For ICD-10-CM, a single code combines\nthe substance-induced mental disorder with the substance use disorder. A separate diag-\nnosis of the comorbid substance use disorder is not given, although the name and severity\nof the specific substance use disorder (when present) are used when recording the sub-\nstance/medication-induced mental disorder. ICD-10-CM codes are also provided for sit-\nuations in which the substance/medication-induced mental disorder is not induced by a\nsubstance use disorder (e.g., when a disorder is induced by one-time use of a substance or\nmedication). Additional information needed to record the diagnostic name of the sub-\nstance/medication-induced mental disorder is provided in the section “Recording Proce-\ndures” for each substance/medication-induced mental disorder in its respective chapter.\nAlcohol-Related Disorders\nAlcohol Use Disorder\nAlcohol Intoxication\nAlcohol Withdrawal\nOther Alcohol-Induced Disorders\nUnspecified Alcohol-Related Disorder", "diagnostic_features": "Specific learning disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a biological origin that is\nthe basis for abnormalities at a cognitive level that are associated with the behavioral signs\nof the disorder. The biological origin includes an interaction of genetic, epigenetic, and en-\nvironmental factors, which affect the brain’s ability to perceive or process verbal or non-\nverbal information efficiently and accurately.\nOne essential feature of specific learning disorder is persistent difficulties learning key-\nstone academic skills (Criterion A), with onset during the years of formal schooling (i.e., the de-\nvelopmental period). Key academic skills include reading of single words accurately and\nfluently, reading comprehension, written expression and spelling, arithmetic calculation, and\nmathematical reasoning (solving mathematical problems). In contrast to talking or walking,\nwhich are acquired developmental milestones that emerge with brain maturation, academic\nskills (e.g., reading, spelling, writing, mathematics) have to be taught and learned explicitly.\nSpecific learning disorder disrupts the normal pattern of learning academic skills; it is not sim-\nply a consequence of lack of opportunity of learning or inadequate instruction. Difficulties\nmastering these key academic skills may also impede learning in other academic subjects (e.g.,\nhistory, science, social studies), but those problems are attributable to difficulties learning the\nunderlying academic skills. Difficulties learning to map letters with the sounds of one’s lan-\nguage—to read printed words (often called dyslexia)—is one of the most common manifesta-\ntions of specific learning disorder. The learning difficulties manifest as a range of observable,\ndescriptive behaviors or symptoms (as listed in Criteria A1–A6). These clinical symptoms may\nbe observed, probed by means of the clinical interview, or ascertained from school reports, rat-\ning scales, or descriptions in previous educational or psychological assessments. The learning\ndifficulties are persistent, not transitory. In children and adolescents, persistence is defined as\nrestricted progress in learning (i.e., no evidence that the individual is catching up with class-\nmates) for at least 6 months despite the provision of extra help at home or school. For example,\ndifficulties learning to read single words that do not fully or rapidly remit with the provision of\ninstruction in phonological skills or word identification strategies may indicate a specific\nSpecific Learning Disorder\n69\nlearning disorder. Evidence of persistent learning difficulties may be derived from cumulative\nschool reports, portfolios of the child’s evaluated work, curriculum-based measures, or clinical\ninterview. In adults, persistent difficulty refers to ongoing difficulties in literacy or numeracy\nskills that manifest during childhood or adolescence, as indicated by cumulative evidence\nfrom school reports, evaluated portfolios of work, or previous assessments.\nA second key feature is that the individual’s performance of the affected academic skills is\nwell below average for age (Criterion B). One robust clinical indicator of difficulties learning\nacademic skills is low academic achievement for age or average achievement that is sustain-\nable only by extraordinarily high levels of effort or support. In children, the low academic skills\ncause significant interference in school performance (as indicated by school reports and\nteacher’s grades or ratings). Another clinical indicator, particularly in adults, is avoidance of\nactivities that require the academic skills. Also in adulthood, low academic skills interfere with\noccupational performance or everyday activities requiring those skills (as indicated by self-re-\nport or report by others). However, this criterion also requires psychometric evidence from an\nindividually administered, psychometrically sound and culturally appropriate test of aca-\ndemic achievement that is norm-referenced or criterion-referenced. Academic skills are dis-\ntributed along a continuum, so there is no natural cutpoint that can be used to differentiate\nindividuals with and without specific learning disorder. Thus, any threshold used to specify\nwhat constitutes significantly low academic achievement (e.g., academic skills well below age\nexpectation) is to a large extent arbitrary. Low achievement scores on one or more standard-\nized tests or subtests within an academic domain (i.e., at least 1.5 standard deviations [SD] be-\nlow the population mean for age, which translates to a standard score of 78 or less, which is\nbelow the 7th percentile) are needed for the greatest diagnostic certainty. However, precise\nscores will vary according to the particular standardized tests that are used. On the basis of\nclinical judgment, a more lenient threshold may be used (e.g., 1.0–2.5 SD below the pop-\nulation mean for age), when learning difficulties are supported by converging evidence\nfrom clinical assessment, academic history, school reports, or test scores. Moreover, since\nstandardized tests are not available in all languages, the diagnosis may then be based in\npart on clinical judgment of scores on available test measures.\nA third core feature is that the learning difficulties are readily apparent in the early\nschool years in most individuals (Criterion C). However, in others, the learning difficulties\nmay not manifest fully until later school years, by which time learning demands have in-\ncreased and exceed the individual’s limited capacities.\nAnother key diagnostic feature is that the learning difficulties are considered “spe-\ncific,” for four reasons. First, they are not attributable to intellectual disabilities (intellec-\ntual disability [intellectual developmental disorder]); global developmental delay;\nhearing or vision disorders, or neurological or motor disorders) (Criterion D). Specific\nlearning disorder affects learning in individuals who otherwise demonstrate normal lev-\nels of intellectual functioning (generally estimated by an IQ score of greater than about 70\n[±5 points allowing for measurement error]). The phrase “unexpected academic under-\nachievement” is often cited as the defining characteristic of specific learning disorder in\nthat the specific learning disabilities are not part of a more general learning difficulty as\nmanifested in intellectual disability or global developmental delay. Specific learning dis-\norder may also occur in individuals identified as intellectually “gifted.” These individuals\nmay be able to sustain apparently adequate academic functioning by using compensatory\nstrategies, extraordinarily high effort, or support, until the learning demands or assess-\nment procedures (e.g., timed tests) pose barriers to their demonstrating their learning or\naccomplishing required tasks. Second, the learning difficulty cannot be attributed to more\ngeneral external factors, such as economic or environmental disadvantage, chronic absen-\nteeism, or lack of education as typically provided in the individual’s community context.\nThird, the learning difficulty cannot be attributed to a neurological (e.g., pediatric stroke)\nor motor disorders or to vision or hearing disorders, which are often associated with prob-\nlems learning academic skills but are distinguishable by presence of neurological signs.\n70\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nFinally, the learning difficulty may be restricted to one academic skill or domain (e.g., read-\ning single words, retrieving or calculating number facts).\nComprehensive assessment is required. Specific learning disorder can only be diagnosed\nafter formal education starts but can be diagnosed at any point afterward in children, adoles-\ncents, or adults, providing there is evidence of onset during the years of formal schooling (i.e.,\nthe developmental period). No single data source is sufficient for a diagnosis of specific learn-\ning disorder. Rather, specific learning disorder is a clinical diagnosis based on a synthesis of\nthe individual’s medical, developmental, educational, and family history; the history of the\nlearning difficulty, including its previous and current manifestation; the impact of the diffi-\nculty on academic, occupational, or social functioning; previous or current school reports;\nportfolios of work requiring academic skills; curriculum-based assessments; and previous or\ncurrent scores from individual standardized tests of academic achievement. If an intellectual,\nsensory, neurological, or motor disorder is suspected, then the clinical assessment for specific\nlearning disorder should also include methods appropriate for these disorders. Thus, compre-\nhensive assessment will involve professionals with expertise in specific learning disorder and\npsychological/cognitive assessment. Since specific learning disorder typically persists into\nadulthood, reassessment is rarely necessary, unless indicated by marked changes in the learn-\ning difficulties (amelioration or worsening) or requested for specific purposes.The diagnosis of developmental coordination disorder is made by a clinical synthesis of the\nhistory (developmental and medical), physical examination, school or workplace report, and\nindividual assessment using psychometrically sound and culturally appropriate standardized\ntests. The manifestation of impaired skills requiring motor coordination (Criterion A) varies\nDevelopmental Coordination Disorder\n75\nwith age. Young children may be delayed in achieving motor milestones (i.e., sitting, crawling,\nwalking), although many achieve typical motor milestones. They also may be delayed in de-\nveloping skills such as negotiating stairs, pedaling, buttoning shirts, completing puzzles, and\nusing zippers. Even when the skill is achieved, movement execution may appear awkward,\nslow, or less precise than that of peers. Older children and adults may display slow speed or in-\naccuracy with motor aspects of activities such as assembling puzzles, building models, playing\nball games (especially in teams), handwriting, typing, driving, or carrying out self-care skills.\nDevelopmental coordination disorder is diagnosed only if the impairment in motor\nskills significantly interferes with the performance of, or participation in, daily activities in\nfamily, social, school, or community life (Criterion B). Examples of such activities include\ngetting dressed, eating meals with age-appropriate utensils and without mess, engaging\nin physical games with others, using specific tools in class such as rulers and scissors, and\nparticipating in team exercise activities at school. Not only is ability to perform these ac-\ntions impaired, but also marked slowness in execution is common. Handwriting compe-\ntence is frequently affected, consequently affecting legibility and/or speed of written output\nand affecting academic achievement (the impact is distinguished from specific learning\ndifficulty by the emphasis on the motoric component of written output skills). In adults,\neveryday skills in education and work, especially those in which speed and accuracy are\nrequired, are affected by coordination problems.\nCriterion C states that the onset of symptoms of developmental coordination disorder\nmust be in the early developmental period. However, developmental coordination disorder is\ntypically not diagnosed before age 5 years because there is considerable variation in the age at\nacquisition of many motor skills or a lack of stability of measurement in early childhood (e.g.,\nsome children catch up) or because other causes of motor delay may not have fully manifested.\nCriterion D specifies that the diagnosis of developmental coordination disorder is\nmade if the coordination difficulties are not better explained by visual impairment or at-\ntributable to a neurological condition. Thus, visual function examination and neurological\nexamination must be included in the diagnostic evaluation. If intellectual disability (intel-\nlectual developmental disorder) is present, the motor difficulties are in excess of those ex-\npected for the mental age; however, no IQ cut-off or discrepancy criterion is specified.\nDevelopmental coordination disorder does not have discrete subtypes; however, indi-\nviduals may be impaired predominantly in gross motor skills or in fine motor skills, in-\ncluding handwriting skills.\nOther terms used to describe developmental coordination disorder include childhood\ndyspraxia, specific developmental disorder of motor function, and clumsy child syndrome.The essential feature of stereotypic movement disorder is repetitive, seemingly driven,\nand apparently purposeless motor behavior (Criterion A). These behaviors are often\nrhythmical movements of the head, hands, or body without obvious adaptive function.\nThe movements may or may not respond to efforts to stop them. Among typically devel-\noping children, the repetitive movements may be stopped when attention is directed to\nthem or when the child is distracted from performing them. Among children with neuro-\ndevelopmental disorders, the behaviors are typically less responsive to such efforts. In\nother cases, the individual demonstrates self-restraining behaviors (e.g., sitting on hands,\nwrapping arms in clothing, finding a protective device).\nThe repertoire of behaviors is variable; each individual presents with his or her own in-\ndividually patterned, “signature” behavior. Examples of non-self-injurious stereotypic\nmovements include, but are not limited to, body rocking, bilateral flapping or rotating\nhand movements, flicking or fluttering fingers in front of the face, arm waving or flapping,\nand head nodding. Stereotyped self-injurious behaviors include, but are not limited to, re-\npetitive head banging, face slapping, eye poking, and biting of hands, lips, or other body\nparts. Eye poking is particularly concerning; it occurs more frequently among children\nwith visual impairment. Multiple movements may be combined (e.g., cocking the head,\nrocking the torso, waving a small string repetitively in front of the face).\nStereotypic movements may occur many times during a day, lasting a few seconds to\nseveral minutes or longer. Frequency can vary from many occurrences in a single day to\nseveral weeks elapsing between episodes. The behaviors vary in context, occurring when\nthe individual is engrossed in other activities, when excited, stressed, fatigued, or bored.\nCriterion A requires that the movements be “apparently” purposeless. However, some\nfunctions may be served by the movements. For example, stereotypic movements might\nreduce anxiety in response to external stressors.\nCriterion B states that the stereotypic movements interfere with social, academic, or\nother activities and, in some children, may result in self-injury (or would if protective mea-\nsures were not used). If self-injury is present, it should be coded using the specifier. Onset\nStereotypic Movement Disorder\n79\nof stereotypic movements is in the early developmental period (Criterion C). Criterion D\nstates that the repetitive, stereotyped behavior in stereotypic movement disorder is not at-\ntributable to the physiological effects of a substance or neurological condition and is not\nbetter explained by another neurodevelopmental or mental disorder. The presence of\nstereotypic movements may indicate an undetected neurodevelopmental problem, espe-\ncially in children ages 1–3 years.Tic disorders comprise four diagnostic categories: Tourette’s disorder, persistent (chronic)\nmotor or vocal tic disorder, provisional tic disorder, and the other specified and unspecified\ntic disorders. Diagnosis for any tic disorder is based on the presence of motor and/or vocal\ntics (Criterion A), duration of tic symptoms (Criterion B), age at onset (Criterion C), and ab-\nsence of any known cause such as another medical condition or substance use (Criterion D).\nThe tic disorders are hierarchical in order (i.e., Tourette’s disorder, followed by persistent\n[chronic] motor or vocal tic disorder, followed by provisional tic disorder, followed by the\n82\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nother specified and unspecified tic disorders), such that once a tic disorder at one level of the\nhierarchy is diagnosed, a lower hierarchy diagnosis cannot be made (Criterion E).\nTics are sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movements or vocalizations. An\nindividual may have various tic symptoms over time, but at any point in time, the tic rep-\nertoire recurs in a characteristic fashion. Although tics can include almost any muscle group\nor vocalization, certain tic symptoms, such as eye blinking or throat clearing, are common\nacross patient populations. Tics are generally experienced as involuntary but can be vol-\nuntarily suppressed for varying lengths of time.\nTics can be either simple or complex. Simple motor tics are of short duration (i.e., milli-\nseconds) and can include eye blinking, shoulder shrugging, and extension of the extrem-\nities. Simple vocal tics include throat clearing, sniffing, and grunting often caused by\ncontraction of the diaphragm or muscles of the oropharynx. Complex motor tics are of lon-\nger duration (i.e., seconds) and often include a combination of simple tics such as simul-\ntaneous head turning and shoulder shrugging. Complex tics can appear purposeful, such\nas a tic-like sexual or obscene gesture (copropraxia) or a tic-like imitation of someone else’s\nmovements (echopraxia). Similarly, complex vocal tics include repeating one’s own sounds\nor words (palilalia), repeating the last-heard word or phrase (echolalia), or uttering socially\nunacceptable words, including obscenities, or ethnic, racial, or religious slurs (coprolalia).\nImportantly, coprolalia is an abrupt, sharp bark or grunt utterance and lacks the prosody\nof similar inappropriate speech observed in human interactions.\nThe presence of motor and/or vocal tics varies across the four tic disorders (Criterion\nA). For Tourette’s disorder, both motor and vocal tics must be present, whereas for per-\nsistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder, only motor or only vocal tics are present. For\nprovisional tic disorder, motor and/or vocal tics may be present. For other specified or un-\nspecified tic disorders, the movement disorder symptoms are best characterized as tics but\nare atypical in presentation or age at onset, or have a known etiology.\nThe 1-year minimum duration criterion (Criterion B) assures that individuals diag-\nnosed with either Tourette’s disorder or persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder\nhave had persistent symptoms. Tics wax and wane in severity, and some individuals may\nhave tic-free periods of weeks to months; however, an individual who has had tic symp-\ntoms of greater than 1 year’s duration since first tic onset would be considered to have per-\nsistent symptoms regardless of duration of tic-free periods. For an individual with motor\nand/or vocal tics of less than 1 year since first tic onset, a provisional tic disorder diagnosis\ncan be considered. There is no duration specification for other specified and unspecified tic\ndisorders. The onset of tics must occur prior to age 18 years (Criterion C). Tic disorders\ntypically begin in the prepubertal period, with an average age at onset between 4 and 6\nyears, and with the incidence of new-onset tic disorders decreasing in the teen years. New\nonset of tic symptoms in adulthood is exceedingly rare and is often associated with expo-\nsures to drugs (e.g., excessive cocaine use) or is a result of a central nervous system insult\n(e.g., postviral encephalitis). Although tic onset is uncommon in teenagers and adults, it is\nnot uncommon for adolescents and adults to present for an initial diagnostic assessment\nand, when carefully evaluated, provide a history of milder symptoms dating back to child-\nhood. New-onset abnormal movements suggestive of tics outside of the usual age range\nshould result in evaluation for other movement disorders or for specific etiologies.\nTic symptoms cannot be attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or an-\nother medical condition (Criterion D). When there is strong evidence from the history,\nphysical examination, and/or laboratory results to suggest a plausible, proximal, and\nprobable cause for a tic disorder, a diagnosis of other specified tic disorder should be used.\nHaving previously met diagnostic criteria for Tourette’s disorder negates a possible di-\nagnosis of persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder (Criterion E). Similarly, a previ-\nous diagnosis of persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder negates a diagnosis of\nprovisional tic disorder or other specified or unspecified tic disorder (Criterion E).\nTic Disorders\n83The essential feature of delusional disorder is the presence of one or more delusions that\npersist for at least 1 month (Criterion A). A diagnosis of delusional disorder is not given if\nthe individual has ever had a symptom presentation that met Criterion A for schizophre-\nnia (Criterion B). Apart from the direct impact of the delusions, impairments in psychoso-\ncial functioning may be more circumscribed than those seen in other psychotic disorders\nsuch as schizophrenia, and behavior is not obviously bizarre or odd (Criterion C). If mood\nepisodes occur concurrently with the delusions, the total duration of these mood episodes\nis brief relative to the total duration of the delusional periods (Criterion D). The delusions\nare not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., cocaine) or another\nmedical condition (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease) and are not better explained by another men-\ntal disorder, such as body dysmorphic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (Crite-\nrion E).\nIn addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the\nassessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making crit-\nically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-\nchotic disorders.The essential feature of brief psychotic disorder is a disturbance that involves the sudden\nonset of at least one of the following positive psychotic symptoms: delusions, hallucina-\ntions, disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence), or grossly abnormal\npsychomotor behavior, including catatonia (Criterion A). Sudden onset is defined as\nchange from a nonpsychotic state to a clearly psychotic state within 2 weeks, usually with-\nout a prodrome. An episode of the disturbance lasts at least 1 day but less than 1 month,\nand the individual eventually has a full return to the premorbid level of functioning (Cri-\nBrief Psychotic Disorder\n95\nterion B). The disturbance is not better explained by a depressive or bipolar disorder with\npsychotic features, by schizoaffective disorder, or by schizophrenia and is not attributable\nto the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a hallucinogen) or another medical condi-\ntion (e.g., subdural hematoma) (Criterion C).\nIn addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the\nassessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making crit-\nically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-\nchotic disorders.The characteristic symptoms of schizophreniform disorder are identical to those of schizo-\nphrenia (Criterion A). Schizophreniform disorder is distinguished by its difference in du-\nration: the total duration of the illness, including prodromal, active, and residual phases, is\nat least 1 month but less than 6 months (Criterion B). The duration requirement for schizo-\nphreniform disorder is intermediate between that for brief psychotic disorder, which lasts\nmore than 1 day and remits by 1 month, and schizophrenia, which lasts for at least 6 months.\nThe diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is made under two conditions. 1) when an ep-\nisode of illness lasts between 1 and 6 months and the individual has already recovered,\nand 2) when an individual is symptomatic for less than the 6 months’ duration required for\nthe diagnosis of schizophrenia but has not yet recovered. In this case, the diagnosis should\nbe noted as “schizophreniform disorder (provisional)” because it is uncertain if the indi-\nvidual will recover from the disturbance within the 6-month period. If the disturbance per-\nsists beyond 6 months, the diagnosis should be changed to schizophrenia.\n98\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\nAnother distinguishing feature of schizophreniform disorder is the lack of a criterion\nrequiring impaired social and occupational functioning. While such impairments may po-\ntentially be present, they are not necessary for a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder.\nIn addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the\nassessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making crit-\nically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-\nchotic disorders.The characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia involve a range of cognitive, behavioral, and\nemotional dysfunctions, but no single symptom is pathognomonic of the disorder. The di-\nagnosis involves the recognition of a constellation of signs and symptoms associated with\nimpaired occupational or social functioning. Individuals with the disorder will vary sub-\nstantially on most features, as schizophrenia is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome.\nAt least two Criterion A symptoms must be present for a significant portion of time\nduring a 1-month period or longer. At least one of these symptoms must be the clear pres-\nence of delusions (Criterion A1), hallucinations (Criterion A2), or disorganized speech\n(Criterion A3). Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior (Criterion A4) and negative\nsymptoms (Criterion A5) may also be present. In those situations in which the active-\nphase symptoms remit within a month in response to treatment, Criterion A is still met if the\nclinician estimates that they would have persisted in the absence of treatment.\nSchizophrenia involves impairment in one or more major areas of functioning (Crite-\nrion B). If the disturbance begins in childhood or adolescence, the expected level of func-\ntion is not attained. Comparing the individual with unaffected siblings may be helpful. The\ndysfunction persists for a substantial period during the course of the disorder and does not\nappear to be a direct result of any single feature. Avolition (i.e., reduced drive to pursue\ngoal-directed behavior; Criterion A5) is linked to the social dysfunction described under\nCriterion B. There is also strong evidence for a relationship between cognitive impairment\n(see the section “Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis” for this disorder) and func-\ntional impairment in individuals with schizophrenia.\nSchizophrenia\n101\nSome signs of the disturbance must persist for a continuous period of at least 6 months\n(Criterion C). Prodromal symptoms often precede the active phase, and residual symp-\ntoms may follow it, characterized by mild or subthreshold forms of hallucinations or\ndelusions. Individuals may express a variety of unusual or odd beliefs that are not of de-\nlusional proportions (e.g., ideas of reference or magical thinking); they may have unusual\nperceptual experiences (e.g., sensing the presence of an unseen person); their speech may\nbe generally understandable but vague; and their behavior may be unusual but not grossly\ndisorganized (e.g., mumbling in public). Negative symptoms are common in the pro-\ndromal and residual phases and can be severe. Individuals who had been socially active\nmay become withdrawn from previous routines. Such behaviors are often the first sign of\na disorder.\nMood symptoms and full mood episodes are common in schizophrenia and may be con-\ncurrent with active-phase symptomatology. However, as distinct from a psychotic mood dis-\norder, a schizophrenia diagnosis requires the presence of delusions or hallucinations in the\nabsence of mood episodes. In addition, mood episodes, taken in total, should be present for\nonly a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.\nIn addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the\nassessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making crit-\nically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-\nchotic disorders.The diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is based on the assessment of an uninterrupted\nperiod of illness during which the individual continues to display active or residual symp-\ntoms of psychotic illness. The diagnosis is usually, but not necessarily, made during the\nperiod of psychotic illness. At some time during the period, Criterion A for schizophrenia\nSchizoaffective Disorder\n107\nhas to be met. Criteria B (social dysfunction) and F (exclusion of autism spectrum disorder\nor other communication disorder of childhood onset) for schizophrenia do not have to be\nmet. In addition to meeting Criterion A for schizophrenia, there is a major mood episode\n(major depressive or manic) (Criterion A for schizoaffective disorder). Because loss of in-\nterest or pleasure is common in schizophrenia, to meet Criterion A for schizoaffective dis-\norder, the major depressive episode must include pervasive depressed mood (i.e., the\npresence of markedly diminished interest or pleasure is not sufficient). Episodes of de-\npression or mania are present for the majority of the total duration of the illness (i.e., after\nCriterion A has been met) (Criterion C for schizoaffective disorder). To separate schizoaf-\nfective disorder from a depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, delusions\nor hallucinations must be present for at least 2 weeks in the absence of a major mood epi-\nsode (depressive or manic) at some point during the lifetime duration of the illness (Cri-\nterion B for schizoaffective disorder). The symptoms must not be attributable to the effects\nof a substance or another medical condition (Criterion D for schizoaffective disorder).\nCriterion C for schizoaffective disorder specifies that mood symptoms meeting criteria\nfor a major mood episode must be present for the majority of the total duration of the ac-\ntive and residual portion of the illness. Criterion C requires the assessment of mood symp-\ntoms for the entire course of a psychotic illness, which differs from the criterion in DSM-IV,\nwhich required only an assessment of the current period of illness. If the mood symptoms\nare present for only a relatively brief period, the diagnosis is schizophrenia, not schizoaf-\nfective disorder. When deciding whether an individual’s presentation meets Criterion C,\nthe clinician should review the total duration of psychotic illness (i.e., both active and re-\nsidual symptoms) and determine when significant mood symptoms (untreated or in need\nof treatment with antidepressant and/or mood-stabilizing medication) accompanied the\npsychotic symptoms. This determination requires sufficient historical information and\nclinical judgment. For example, an individual with a 4-year history of active and residual\nsymptoms of schizophrenia develops depressive and manic episodes that, taken together,\ndo not occupy more than 1 year during the 4-year history of psychotic illness. This presen-\ntation would not meet Criterion C.\nIn addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the\nassessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making crit-\nically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-\nchotic disorders.The essential features of substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder are prominent\ndelusions and/or hallucinations (Criterion A) that are judged to be due to the physiolog-\nical effects of a substance/medication (i.e., a drug of abuse, a medication, or a toxin expo-\nsure) (Criterion B). Hallucinations that the individual realizes are substance/medication-\ninduced are not included here and instead would be diagnosed as substance intoxication\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder\n113\nor substance withdrawal with the accompanying specifier “with perceptual disturbances”\n(applies to alcohol withdrawal; cannabis intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic\nwithdrawal; and stimulant intoxication).\nA substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder is distinguished from a primary\npsychotic disorder by considering the onset, course, and other factors. For drugs of abuse,\nthere must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of\nsubstance use, intoxication, or withdrawal. Substance/medication-induced psychotic\ndisorders arise during or soon after exposure to a medication or after substance intoxica-\ntion or withdrawal but can persist for weeks, whereas primary psychotic disorders may\nprecede the onset of substance/medication use or may occur during times of sustained ab-\nstinence. Once initiated, the psychotic symptoms may continue as long as the substance/\nmedication use continues. Another consideration is the presence of features that are atyp-\nical of a primary psychotic disorder (e.g., atypical age at onset or course). For example, the\nappearance of delusions de novo in a person older than 35 years without a known history\nof a primary psychotic disorder should suggest the possibility of a substance/medication-\ninduced psychotic disorder. Even a prior history of a primary psychotic disorder does not\nrule out the possibility of a substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. In contrast,\nfactors that suggest that the psychotic symptoms are better accounted for by a primary\npsychotic disorder include persistence of psychotic symptoms for a substantial period of\ntime (i.e., a month or more) after the end of substance intoxication or acute substance with-\ndrawal or after cessation of medication use; or a history of prior recurrent primary psy-\nchotic disorders. Other causes of psychotic symptoms must be considered even in an\nindividual with substance intoxication or withdrawal, because substance use problems are\nnot uncommon among individuals with non-substance/medication-induced psychotic\ndisorders.\nIn addition to the four symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the\nassessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making crit-\nically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-\nchotic disorders.The essential features of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition are promi-\nnent delusions or hallucinations that are judged to be attributable to the physiological ef-\nfects of another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder\n(e.g., the symptoms are not a psychologically mediated response to a severe medical con-\ndition, in which case a diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder, with marked stressor, would\nbe appropriate).\nHallucinations can occur in any sensory modality (i.e., visual, olfactory, gustatory, tac-\ntile, or auditory), but certain etiological factors are likely to evoke specific hallucinatory\nphenomena. Olfactory hallucinations are suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. Hallucina-\ntions may vary from simple and unformed to highly complex and organized, depending\non etiological and environmental factors. Psychotic disorder due to another medical con-\ndition is generally not diagnosed if the individual maintains reality testing for the hallu-\ncinations and appreciates that they result from the medical condition. Delusions may have\na variety of themes, including somatic, grandiose, religious, and, most commonly, perse-\ncutory. On the whole, however, associations between delusions and particular medical\nconditions appear to be less specific than is the case for hallucinations.\nIn determining whether the psychotic disturbance is attributable to another medical\ncondition, the presence of a medical condition must be identified and considered to be the\netiology of the psychosis through a physiological mechanism. Although there are no\ninfallible guidelines for determining whether the relationship between the psychotic distur-\nbance and the medical condition is etiological, several considerations provide some guidance.\nOne consideration is the presence of a temporal association between the onset, exacerba-\ntion, or remission of the medical condition and that of the psychotic disturbance. A second\nconsideration is the presence of features that are atypical for a psychotic disorder (e.g.,\natypical age at onset or presence of visual or olfactory hallucinations). The disturbance must\nalso be distinguished from a substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder or an-\nother mental disorder (e.g., an adjustment disorder).Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (catatonia specifier) may be used when\ncriteria are met for catatonia during the course of a neurodevelopmental, psychotic, bipo-\nlar, depressive, or other mental disorder. The catatonia specifier is appropriate when the\nclinical picture is characterized by marked psychomotor disturbance and involves at least\nthree of the 12 diagnostic features listed in Criterion A. Catatonia is typically diagnosed in\nan inpatient setting and occurs in up to 35% of individuals with schizophrenia, but the ma-\njority of catatonia cases involve individuals with depressive or bipolar disorders. Before\nthe catatonia specifier is used in neurodevelopmental, psychotic, bipolar, depressive, or\nother mental disorders, a wide variety of other medical conditions need to be ruled out;\nthese conditions include, but are not limited to, medical conditions due to infectious, met-\nabolic, or neurological conditions (see “Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Con-\ndition”). Catatonia can also be a side effect of a medication (see the chapter “Medication-\nInduced Movement Disorders and Other Adverse Effects of Medication”). Because of the\nseriousness of the complications, particular attention should be paid to the possibility that\nthe catatonia is attributable to 333.92 (G21.0) neuroleptic malignant syndrome.\nCatatonic Disorder Due to\nAnother Medical ConditionThe essential feature of catatonic disorder due to another medical condition is the presence\nof catatonia that is judged to be attributed to the physiological effects of another medical\ncondition. Catatonia can be diagnosed by the presence of at least three of the 12 clinical fea-\ntures in Criterion A. There must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or\nlaboratory findings that the catatonia is attributable to another medical condition (Crite-\nrion B). The diagnosis is not given if the catatonia is better explained by another mental\ndisorder (e.g., manic episode) (Criterion C) or if it occurs exclusively during the course of\na delirium (Criterion D).The essential feature of a manic episode is a distinct period during which there is an ab-\nnormally, persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and persistently increased\nactivity or energy that is present for most of the day, nearly every day, for a period of at\nleast 1 week (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary), accompanied by at least three\nadditional symptoms from Criterion B. If the mood is irritable rather than elevated or ex-\npansive, at least four Criterion B symptoms must be present.\nMood in a manic episode is often described as euphoric, excessively cheerful, high, or\n“feeling on top of the world.” In some cases, the mood is of such a highly infectious quality\nthat it is easily recognized as excessive and may be characterized by unlimited and hap-\nhazard enthusiasm for interpersonal, sexual, or occupational interactions. For example,\nthe individual may spontaneously start extensive conversations with strangers in public.\nOften the predominant mood is irritable rather than elevated, particularly when the indi-\nvidual’s wishes are denied or if the individual has been using substances. Rapid shifts in\nmood over brief periods of time may occur and are referred to as lability (i.e., the alterna-\nWith psychotic\nfeatures***\n(p. 152)\n296.44\n(F31.2)\nNA\n296.54\n(F31.5)\nNA\nIn partial\nremission (p. 154)\n296.45\n(F31.73)\n296.45\n(F31.71)\n296.55\n(F31.75)\nNA\nIn full remission\n(p. 154)\n296.46\n(F31.74)\n296.46\n(F31.72)\n296.56\n(F31.76)\nNA\nUnspecified\n296.40\n(F31.9)\n296.40\n(F31.9)\n296.50\n(F31.9)\nNA\n*Severity and psychotic specifiers do not apply; code 296.40 (F31.0) for cases not in remission.\n**Severity, psychotic, and remission specifiers do not apply.

In children, happiness, silliness and\n“goofiness” are normal in the context of special occasions; however, if these symptoms are\nrecurrent, inappropriate to the context, and beyond what is expected for the developmen-\ntal level of the child, they may meet Criterion A. If the happiness is unusual for a child (i.e.,\ndistinct from baseline), and the mood change occurs at the same time as symptoms that\nmeet Criterion B for mania, diagnostic certainty is increased; however, the mood change\nmust be accompanied by persistently increased activity or energy levels that are obvious\nto those who know the child well.\nDuring the manic episode, the individual may engage in multiple overlapping new\nprojects. The projects are often initiated with little knowledge of the topic, and nothing seems\nout of the individual’s reach. The increased activity levels may manifest at unusual hours of\nthe day.\nInflated self-esteem is typically present, ranging from uncritical self-confidence to marked\ngrandiosity, and may reach delusional proportions (Criterion B1). Despite lack of any partic-\nular experience or talent, the individual may embark on complex tasks such as writing a novel\nor seeking publicity for some impractical invention. Grandiose delusions (e.g., of having a\nspecial relationship to a famous person) are common. In children, overestimation of abilities\nand belief that, for example, they are the best at a sport or the smartest in the class is normal;\nhowever, when such beliefs are present despite clear evidence to the contrary or the child at-\ntempts feats that are clearly dangerous and, most important, represent a change from the\nchild’s normal behavior, the grandiosity criterion should be considered satisfied.\nOne of the most common features is a decreased need for sleep (Criterion B2) and is\ndistinct from insomnia in which the individual wants to sleep or feels the need to sleep but\nis unable. The individual may sleep little, if at all, or may awaken several hours earlier than\nusual, feeling rested and full of energy. When the sleep disturbance is severe, the individ-\nual may go for days without sleep, yet not feel tired. Often a decreased need for sleep her-\nalds the onset of a manic episode.\nSpeech can be rapid, pressured, loud, and difficult to interrupt (Criterion B3). Individ-\nuals may talk continuously and without regard for others’ wishes to communicate, often\nin an intrusive manner or without concern for the relevance of what is said. Speech is\nsometimes characterized by jokes, puns, amusing irrelevancies, and theatricality, with\ndramatic mannerisms, singing, and excessive gesturing. Loudness and forcefulness of\nspeech often become more important than what is conveyed. If the individual’s mood is\nmore irritable than expansive, speech may be marked by complaints, hostile comments, or\nangry tirades, particularly if attempts are made to interrupt the individual. Both Criterion\nA and Criterion B symptoms may be accompanied by symptoms of the opposite (i.e., de-\npressive) pole (see “with mixed features” specifier, pp. 149–150).\nOften the individual’s thoughts race at a rate faster than they can be expressed through\nspeech (Criterion B4). Frequently there is flight of ideas evidenced by a nearly continuous flow\nof accelerated speech, with abrupt shifts from one topic to another. When flight of ideas is se-\nvere, speech may become disorganized, incoherent, and particularly distressful to the individ-\nual. Sometimes thoughts are experienced as so crowded that it is very difficult to speak.\nDistractibility (Criterion B5) is evidenced by an inability to censor immaterial external\nstimuli (e.g., the interviewer’s attire, background noises or conversations, furnishings in\nthe room) and often prevents individuals experiencing mania from holding a rational con-\nversation or attending to instructions.\nThe increase in goal-directed activity often consists of excessive planning and partici-\npation in multiple activities, including sexual, occupational, political, or religious activi-\nties. Increased sexual drive, fantasies, and behavior are often present. Individuals in a manic\nepisode usually show increased sociability (e.g., renewing old acquaintances or calling or\ncontacting friends or even strangers), without regard to the intrusive, domineering, and\ndemanding nature of these interactions. They often display psychomotor agitation or rest-\nlessness (i.e., purposeless activity) by pacing or by holding multiple conversations simulta-\nBipolar I Disorder\n129\nneously. Some individuals write excessive letters, e-mails, text messages, and so forth, on\nmany different topics to friends, public figures, or the media.\nThe increased activity criterion can be difficult to ascertain in children; however, when\nthe child takes on many tasks simultaneously, starts devising elaborate and unrealistic\nplans for projects, develops previously absent and developmentally inappropriate sexual\npreoccupations (not accounted for by sexual abuse or exposure to sexually explicit mate-\nrial), then Criterion B might be met based on clinical judgment. It is essential to determine\nwhether the behavior represents a change from the child’s baseline behavior; occurs most\nof the day, nearly every day for the requisite time period; and occurs in temporal associa-\ntion with other symptoms of mania.\nThe expansive mood, excessive optimism, grandiosity, and poor judgment often lead\nto reckless involvement in activities such as spending sprees, giving away possessions,\nreckless driving, foolish business investments, and sexual promiscuity that is unusual for\nthe individual, even though these activities are likely to have catastrophic consequences\n(Criterion B7). The individual may purchase many unneeded items without the money to\npay for them and, in some cases, give them away. Sexual behavior may include infidelity\nor indiscriminate sexual encounters with strangers, often disregarding the risk of sexually\ntransmitted diseases or interpersonal consequences.\nThe manic episode must result in marked impairment in social or occupational func-\ntioning or require hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others (e.g., financial losses, il-\nlegal activities, loss of employment, self-injurious behavior). By definition, the presence of\npsychotic features during a manic episode also satisfies Criterion C.\nManic symptoms or syndromes that are attributable to the physiological effects of a\ndrug of abuse (e.g., in the context of cocaine or amphetamine intoxication), the side effects\nof medications or treatments (e.g., steroids, L-dopa, antidepressants, stimulants), or an-\nother medical condition do not count toward the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. However,\na fully syndromal manic episode that arises during treatment (e.g., with medications, elec-\ntroconvulsive therapy, light therapy) or drug use and persists beyond the physiological ef-\nfect of the inducing agent (i.e., after a medication is fully out of the individual’s system or\nthe effects of electroconvulsive therapy would be expected to have dissipated completely)\nis sufficient evidence for a manic episode diagnosis (Criterion D). Caution is indicated so\nthat one or two symptoms (particularly increased irritability, edginess, or agitation follow-\ning antidepressant use) are not taken as sufficient for diagnosis of a manic or hypomanic\nepisode, nor necessarily an indication of a bipolar disorder diathesis. It is necessary to\nmeet criteria for a manic episode to make a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, but it is not re-\nquired to have hypomanic or major depressive episodes. However, they may precede or\nfollow a manic episode. Full descriptions of the diagnostic features of a hypomanic epi-\nsode may be found within the text for bipolar II disorder, and the features of a major de-\npressive episode are described within the text for major depressive disorder.Bipolar II disorder is characterized by a clinical course of recurring mood episodes con-\nsisting of one or more major depressive episodes (Criteria A–C under “Major Depressive\nEpisode”) and at least one hypomanic episode (Criteria A–F under “Hypomanic Epi-\nsode”). The major depressive episode must last at least 2 weeks, and the hypomanic epi-\nsode must last at least 4 days, to meet the diagnostic criteria. During the mood episode(s),\nthe requisite number of symptoms must be present most of the day, nearly every day, and\nrepresent a noticeable change from usual behavior and functioning. The presence of a\nmanic episode during the course of illness precludes the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder\n(Criterion B under “Bipolar II Disorder”). Episodes of substance/medication-induced de-\npressive disorder or substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder (repre-\nsenting the physiological effects of a medication, other somatic treatments for depression,\ndrugs of abuse, or toxin exposure) or of depressive and related disorder due to another\nmedical condition or bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition do not\ncount toward a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder unless they persist beyond the physiolog-\nical effects of the treatment or substance and then meet duration criteria for an episode. In\naddition, the episodes must not be better accounted for by schizoaffective disorder and are\nnot superimposed on schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or\nother specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorders (Cri-\nterion C under “Bipolar II Disorder”). The depressive episodes or hypomanic fluctuations\nmust cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other\nimportant areas of functioning (Criterion D under “Bipolar II Disorder”); however, for hy-\npomanic episodes, this requirement does not have to be met. A hypomanic episode that\ncauses significant impairment would likely qualify for the diagnosis of manic episode and,\ntherefore, for a lifetime diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. The recurrent major depressive ep-\nisodes are often more frequent and lengthier than those occurring in bipolar I disorder.\nIndividuals with bipolar II disorder typically present to a clinician during a major de-\npressive episode and are unlikely to complain initially of hypomania. Typically, the hy-\npomanic episodes themselves do not cause impairment. Instead, the impairment results\nfrom the major depressive episodes or from a persistent pattern of unpredictable mood\nchanges and fluctuating, unreliable interpersonal or occupational functioning. Individu-\nals with bipolar II disorder may not view the hypomanic episodes as pathological or dis-\nadvantageous, although others may be troubled by the individual’s erratic behavior.\nClinical information from other informants, such as close friends or relatives, is often use-\nful in establishing the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder.\n136\nBipolar and Related Disorders\nA hypomanic episode should not be confused with the several days of euthymia and re-\nstored energy or activity that may follow remission of a major depressive episode. Despite the\nsubstantial differences in duration and severity between a manic and hypomanic episode, bi-\npolar II disorder is not a “milder form” of bipolar I disorder. Compared with individuals with\nbipolar I disorder, individuals with bipolar II disorder have greater chronicity of illness and\nspend, on average, more time in the depressive phase of their illness, which can be severe and/\nor disabling. Depressive symptoms co-occurring with a hypomanic episode or hypomanic\nsymptoms co-occurring with a depressive episode are common in individuals with bipolar II\ndisorder and are overrepresented in females, particularly hypomania with mixed features. In-\ndividuals experiencing hypomania with mixed features may not label their symptoms as hy-\npomania, but instead experience them as depression with increased energy or irritability.The essential feature of cyclothymic disorder is a chronic, fluctuating mood disturbance\ninvolving numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depressive symp-\ntoms that are distinct from each other (Criterion A). The hypomanic symptoms are of\ninsufficient number, severity, pervasiveness, or duration to meet full criteria for a hypo-\nmanic episode, and the depressive symptoms are of insufficient number, severity, perva-\nsiveness, or duration to meet full criteria for a major depressive episode. During the initial\n2-year period (1 year for children or adolescents), the symptoms must be persistent (pres-\nent more days than not), and any symptom-free intervals last no longer than 2 months\n(Criterion B). The diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder is made only if the criteria for a major\ndepressive, manic, or hypomanic episode have never been met (Criterion C).\nIf an individual with cyclothymic disorder subsequently (i.e., after the initial 2 years in\nadults or 1 year in children or adolescents) experiences a major depressive, manic, or hy-\npomanic episode, the diagnosis changes to major depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder,\nor other specified or unspecified bipolar and related disorder (subclassified as hypomanic\nepisode without prior major depressive episode), respectively, and the cyclothymic disor-\nder diagnosis is dropped.\nThe cyclothymic disorder diagnosis is not made if the pattern of mood swings is better\nexplained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delu-\nsional disorder, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other\npsychotic disorders (Criterion D), in which case the mood symptoms are considered asso-\nciated features of the psychotic disorder. The mood disturbance must also not be attribut-\nable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or\nanother medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism) (Criterion E). Although some individ-\nuals may function particularly well during some of the periods of hypomania, over the\nprolonged course of the disorder, there must be clinically significant distress or impair-\nment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning as a result of the\nmood disturbance (Criterion F). The impairment may develop as a result of prolonged pe-\nriods of cyclical, often unpredictable mood changes (e.g., the individual may be regarded\nas temperamental, moody, unpredictable, inconsistent, or unreliable).The diagnostic features of substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder are es-\nsentially the same as those for mania, hypomania, or depression. A key exception to the diag-\nnosis of substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder is the case of hypomania\nor mania that occurs after antidepressant medication use or other treatments and persists be-\nyond the physiological effects of the medication. This condition is considered an indicator of\ntrue bipolar disorder, not substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder. Simi-\nlarly, individuals with apparent electroconvulsive therapy–induced manic or hypomanic ep-\nisodes that persist beyond the physiological effects of the treatment are diagnosed with\nbipolar disorder, not substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder.\nSide effects of some antidepressants and other psychotropic drugs (e.g., edginess, ag-\nitation) may resemble the primary symptoms of a manic syndrome, but they are funda-\nmentally distinct from bipolar symptoms and are insufficient for the diagnosis. That is, the\ncriterion symptoms of mania/hypomania have specificity (simple agitation is not the same\nas excess involvement in purposeful activities), and a sufficient number of symptoms\nmust be present (not just one or two symptoms) to make these diagnoses. In particular, the\nappearance of one or two nonspecific symptoms—irritability, edginess, or agitation during\nantidepressant treatment—in the absence of a full manic or hypomanic syndrome should\nnot be taken to support a diagnosis of a bipolar disorder.The essential features of bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition are\npresence of a prominent and persistent period of abnormally elevated, expansive, or irri-\ntable mood and abnormally increased activity or energy predominating in the clinical pic-\nture that is attributable to another medical condition (Criterion B). In most cases the manic\nor hypomanic picture may appear during the initial presentation of the medical condition\n(i.e., within 1 month); however, there are exceptions, especially in chronic medical condi-\ntions that might worsen or relapse and herald the appearance of the manic or hypomanic\npicture. Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition would not be diag-\nnosed when the manic or hypomanic episodes definitely preceded the medical condition,\nsince the proper diagnosis would be bipolar disorder (except in the unusual circumstance\nin which all preceding manic or hypomanic episodes—or, when only one such episode has\noccurred, the preceding manic or hypomanic episode—were associated with ingestion of\na substance/medication). The diagnosis of bipolar and related disorder due to another\nmedical condition should not be made during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The\nmanic or hypomanic episode in bipolar and related disorder due to another medical con-\ndition must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or\nother important areas of functioning to qualify for this diagnosis (Criterion E).The core feature of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is chronic, severe persistent ir-\nritability. This severe irritability has two prominent clinical manifestations, the first of\nwhich is frequent temper outbursts. These outbursts typically occur in response to frus-\ntration and can be verbal or behavioral (the latter in the form of aggression against prop-\nerty, self, or others). They must occur frequently (i.e., on average, three or more times per\nweek) (Criterion C) over at least 1 year in at least two settings (Criteria E and F), such as in\nthe home and at school, and they must be developmentally inappropriate (Criterion B).\nThe second manifestation of severe irritability consists of chronic, persistently irritable or\nangry mood that is present between the severe temper outbursts. This irritable or angry\nmood must be characteristic of the child, being present most of the day, nearly every day,\nand noticeable by others in the child’s environment (Criterion D).\nDisruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder\n157\nThe clinical presentation of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder must be carefully\ndistinguished from presentations of other, related conditions, particularly pediatric bi-\npolar disorder. In fact, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder was added to DSM-5 to\naddress the considerable concern about the appropriate classification and treatment of\nchildren who present with chronic, persistent irritability relative to children who present\nwith classic (i.e., episodic) bipolar disorder.\nSome researchers view severe, non-episodic irritability as characteristic of bipolar dis-\norder in children, although both DSM-IV and DSM-5 require that both children and adults\nhave distinct episodes of mania or hypomania to qualify for the diagnosis of bipolar I dis-\norder. During the latter decades of the 20th century, this contention by researchers that\nsevere, nonepisodic irritability is a manifestation of pediatric mania coincided with an up-\nsurge in the rates at which clinicians assigned the diagnosis of bipolar disorder to their\npediatric patients. This sharp increase in rates appears to be attributable to clinicians com-\nbining at least two clinical presentations into a single category. That is, both classic, epi-\nsodic presentations of mania and non-episodic presentations of severe irritability have\nbeen labeled as bipolar disorder in children. In DSM-5, the term bipolar disorder is explicitly\nreserved for episodic presentations of bipolar symptoms. DSM-IV did not include a diagno-\nsis designed to capture youths whose hallmark symptoms consisted of very severe, non-\nepisodic irritability, whereas DSM-5, with the inclusion of disruptive mood dysregulation\ndisorder, provides a distinct category for such presentations.The criterion symptoms for major depressive disorder must be present nearly every day to\nbe considered present, with the exception of weight change and suicidal ideation. De-\npressed mood must be present for most of the day, in addition to being present nearly ev-\nery day. Often insomnia or fatigue is the presenting complaint, and failure to probe for\naccompanying depressive symptoms will result in underdiagnosis. Sadness may be de-\nnied at first but may be elicited through interview or inferred from facial expression and\ndemeanor. With individuals who focus on a somatic complaint, clinicians should de-\ntermine whether the distress from that complaint is associated with specific depressive\nsymptoms. Fatigue and sleep disturbance are present in a high proportion of cases; psy-\nchomotor disturbances are much less common but are indicative of greater overall sever-\nity, as is the presence of delusional or near-delusional guilt.\nSeverity/course specifier\nSingle episode\nRecurrent episode*\nMild (p. 188)\n296.21 (F32.0)\n296.31 (F33.0)\nModerate (p. 188)\n296.22 (F32.1)\n296.32 (F33.1)\nSevere (p. 188)\n296.23 (F32.2)\n296.33 (F33.2)\nWith psychotic features** (p. 186)\n296.24 (F32.3)\n296.34 (F33.3)\nIn partial remission (p. 188)\n296.25 (F32.4)\n296.35 (F33.41)\nIn full remission (p. 188)\n296.26 (F32.5)\n296.36 (F33.42)\nUnspecified\n296.20 (F32.9)\n296.30 (F33.9)\n*For an episode to be considered recurrent, there must be an interval of at least 2 consecutive months\nbetween separate episodes in which criteria are not met for a major depressive episode.

In children and adolescents, the mood may be irritable rather than sad.\nThe individual must also experience at least four additional symptoms drawn from a list\nthat includes changes in appetite or weight, sleep, and psychomotor activity; decreased en-\nergy; feelings of worthlessness or guilt; difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making deci-\nsions; or recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation or suicide plans or attempts. To\ncount toward a major depressive episode, a symptom must either be newly present or must\nhave clearly worsened compared with the person’s pre-episode status. The symptoms\nmust persist for most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 2 consecutive weeks. The ep-\nisode must be accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-\npational, or other important areas of functioning. For some individuals with milder\nepisodes, functioning may appear to be normal but requires markedly increased effort.\nThe mood in a major depressive episode is often described by the person as depressed,\nsad, hopeless, discouraged, or “down in the dumps” (Criterion A1). In some cases, sadness\nmay be denied at first but may subsequently be elicited by interview (e.g., by pointing out\nthat the individual looks as if he or she is about to cry). In some individuals who complain\nof feeling “blah,” having no feelings, or feeling anxious, the presence of a depressed mood\ncan be inferred from the person’s facial expression and demeanor. Some individuals em-\nphasize somatic complaints (e.g., bodily aches and pains) rather than reporting feelings of\nsadness. Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability (e.g., persistent anger, a\ntendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming others, an exaggerated\nsense of frustration over minor matters). In children and adolescents, an irritable or cranky\nmood may develop rather than a sad or dejected mood. This presentation should be dif-\nferentiated from a pattern of irritability when frustrated.\nLoss of interest or pleasure is nearly always present, at least to some degree. Individ-\nuals may report feeling less interested in hobbies, “not caring anymore,” or not feeling any\nenjoyment in activities that were previously considered pleasurable (Criterion A2). Family\nmembers often notice social withdrawal or neglect of pleasurable avocations (e.g., a for-\nmerly avid golfer no longer plays, a child who used to enjoy soccer finds excuses not to\npractice). In some individuals, there is a significant reduction from previous levels of sex-\nual interest or desire.\nAppetite change may involve either a reduction or increase. Some depressed individ-\nuals report that they have to force themselves to eat. Others may eat more and may crave\nspecific foods (e.g., sweets or other carbohydrates). When appetite changes are severe (in\neither direction), there may be a significant loss or gain in weight, or, in children, a failure\nto make expected weight gains may be noted (Criterion A3).\nSleep disturbance may take the form of either difficulty sleeping or sleeping exces-\nsively (Criterion A4). When insomnia is present, it typically takes the form of middle in-\nsomnia (i.e., waking up during the night and then having difficulty returning to sleep) or\nterminal insomnia (i.e., waking too early and being unable to return to sleep). Initial in-\nsomnia (i.e., difficulty falling asleep) may also occur. Individuals who present with over-\nsleeping (hypersomnia) may experience prolonged sleep episodes at night or increased\ndaytime sleep. Sometimes the reason that the individual seeks treatment is for the dis-\nturbed sleep.\nPsychomotor changes include agitation (e.g., the inability to sit still, pacing, hand-\nwringing; or pulling or rubbing of the skin, clothing, or other objects) or retardation (e.g.,\nslowed speech, thinking, and body movements; increased pauses before answering;\nspeech that is decreased in volume, inflection, amount, or variety of content, or muteness)\n(Criterion A5). The psychomotor agitation or retardation must be severe enough to be ob-\nservable by others and not represent merely subjective feelings.\nDecreased energy, tiredness, and fatigue are common (Criterion A6). A person may re-\nport sustained fatigue without physical exertion. Even the smallest tasks seem to require\n164\nDepressive Disorders\nsubstantial effort. The efficiency with which tasks are accomplished may be reduced. For\nexample, an individual may complain that washing and dressing in the morning are ex-\nhausting and take twice as long as usual.\nThe sense of worthlessness or guilt associated with a major depressive episode may in-\nclude unrealistic negative evaluations of one’s worth or guilty preoccupations or rumina-\ntions over minor past failings (Criterion A7). Such individuals often misinterpret neutral\nor trivial day-to-day events as evidence of personal defects and have an exaggerated sense\nof responsibility for untoward events. The sense of worthlessness or guilt may be of delu-\nsional proportions (e.g., an individual who is convinced that he or she is personally re-\nsponsible for world poverty). Blaming oneself for being sick and for failing to meet\noccupational or interpersonal responsibilities as a result of the depression is very common\nand, unless delusional, is not considered sufficient to meet this criterion.\nMany individuals report impaired ability to think, concentrate, or make even minor\ndecisions (Criterion A8). They may appear easily distracted or complain of memory diffi-\nculties. Those engaged in cognitively demanding pursuits are often unable to function. In\nchildren, a precipitous drop in grades may reflect poor concentration. In elderly individ-\nuals, memory difficulties may be the chief complaint and may be mistaken for early signs\nof a dementia (“pseudodementia”). When the major depressive episode is successfully\ntreated, the memory problems often fully abate. However, in some individuals, particu-\nlarly elderly persons, a major depressive episode may sometimes be the initial presenta-\ntion of an irreversible dementia.\nThoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts (Criterion A9) are common.\nThey may range from a passive wish not to awaken in the morning or a belief that others\nwould be better off if the individual were dead, to transient but recurrent thoughts of com-\nmitting suicide, to a specific suicide plan. More severely suicidal individuals may have put\ntheir affairs in order (e.g., updated wills, settled debts), acquired needed materials (e.g., a\nrope or a gun), and chosen a location and time to accomplish the suicide. Motivations for\nsuicide may include a desire to give up in the face of perceived insurmountable obstacles,\nan intense wish to end what is perceived as an unending and excruciatingly painful emo-\ntional state, an inability to foresee any enjoyment in life, or the wish to not be a burden to\nothers. The resolution of such thinking may be a more meaningful measure of diminishedThe essential feature of persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) is a depressed mood\nthat occurs for most of the day, for more days than not, for at least 2 years, or at least 1 year\nfor children and adolescents (Criterion A). This disorder represents a consolidation of\nDSM-IV-defined chronic major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder. Major de-\npression may precede persistent depressive disorder, and major depressive episodes may\noccur during persistent depressive disorder. Individuals whose symptoms meet major de-\npressive disorder criteria for 2 years should be given a diagnosis of persistent depressive\ndisorder as well as major depressive disorder.\nIndividuals with persistent depressive disorder describe their mood as sad or “down\nin the dumps.” During periods of depressed mood, at least two of the six symptoms from\nCriterion B are present. Because these symptoms have become a part of the individual’s\nday-to-day experience, particularly in the case of early onset (e.g., “I’ve always been this\n170\nDepressive Disorders\nway”), they may not be reported unless the individual is directly prompted. During the 2-year\nperiod (1 year for children or adolescents), any symptom-free intervals last no longer than\n2 months (Criterion C).The essential features of premenstrual dysphoric disorder are the expression of mood la-\nbility, irritability, dysphoria, and anxiety symptoms that occur repeatedly during the pre-\nmenstrual phase of the cycle and remit around the onset of menses or shortly thereafter.\nThese symptoms may be accompanied by behavioral and physical symptoms. Symptoms\nmust have occurred in most of the menstrual cycles during the past year and must have an\nadverse effect on work or social functioning. The intensity and/or expressivity of the ac-\ncompanying symptoms may be closely related to social and cultural background charac-\nteristics of the affected female, family perspectives, and more specific factors such as\nreligious beliefs, social tolerance, and female gender role issues.\nTypically, symptoms peak around the time of the onset of menses. Although it is not\nuncommon for symptoms to linger into the first few days of menses, the individual must\nhave a symptom-free period in the follicular phase after the menstrual period begins.\nWhile the core symptoms include mood and anxiety symptoms, behavioral and somatic\nsymptoms commonly also occur. However, the presence of physical and/or behavioral\nsymptoms in the absence of mood and/or anxious symptoms is not sufficient for a diag-\nPremenstrual Dysphoric Disorder\n173\nnosis. Symptoms are of comparable severity (but not duration) to those of another mental\ndisorder, such as a major depressive episode or generalized anxiety disorder. In order to\nconfirm a provisional diagnosis, daily prospective symptom ratings are required for at\nleast two symptomatic cycles.The diagnostic features of substance/medication-induced depressive disorder include the\nsymptoms of a depressive disorder, such as major depressive disorder; however, the de-\npressive symptoms are associated with the ingestion, injection, or inhalation of a sub-\nstance (e.g., drug of abuse, toxin, psychotropic medication, other medication), and the\ndepressive symptoms persist beyond the expected length of physiological effects, intoxi-\ncation, or withdrawal period. As evidenced by clinical history, physical examination, or\nlaboratory findings, the relevant depressive disorder should have developed during or\nwithin 1 month after use of a substance that is capable of producing the depressive disor-\nder (Criterion B1). In addition, the diagnosis is not better explained by an independent\ndepressive disorder. Evidence of an independent depressive disorder includes the de-\npressive disorder preceded the onset of ingestion or withdrawal from the substance; the\ndepressive disorder persists beyond a substantial period of time after the cessation of sub-\nstance use; or other evidence suggests the existence of an independent non-substance/\nmedication-induced depressive disorder (Criterion C). This diagnosis should not be made\nwhen symptoms occur exclusively during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The de-\npressive disorder associated with the substance use, intoxication, or withdrawal must\ncause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other impor-\ntant areas of functioning to qualify for this diagnosis (Criterion E).\nSome medications (e.g., stimulants, steroids, L-dopa, antibiotics, central nervous\nsystem drugs, dermatological agents, chemotherapeutic drugs, immunological agents)\n178\nDepressive Disorders\ncan induce depressive mood disturbances. Clinical judgment is essential to determine\nwhether the medication is truly associated with inducing the depressive disorder or\nwhether a primary depressive disorder happened to have its onset while the person was\nreceiving the treatment. For example, a depressive episode that developed within the first\nseveral weeks of beginning alpha-methyldopa (an antihypertensive agent) in an individ-\nual with no history of major depressive disorder would qualify for the diagnosis of med-\nication-induced depressive disorder. In some cases, a previously established condition\n(e.g., major depressive disorder, recurrent) can recur while the individual is coincidentally\ntaking a medication that has the capacity to cause depressive symptoms (e.g., L-dopa, oral\ncontraceptives). In such cases, the clinician must make a judgment as to whether the med-\nication is causative in this particular situation.\nA substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is distinguished from a primary\ndepressive disorder by considering the onset, course, and other factors associated with the\nsubstance use. There must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or labora-\ntory findings of substance use, abuse, intoxication, or withdrawal prior to the onset of the\ndepressive disorder. The withdrawal state for some substances can be relatively pro-\ntracted, and thus intense depressive symptoms can last for a long period after the cessation\nof substance use.The essential feature of depressive disorder due to another medical condition is a promi-\nnent and persistent period of depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or plea-\nsure in all, or almost all, activities that predominates in the clinical picture (Criterion A)\nand that is thought to be related to the direct physiological effects of another medical con-\ndition (Criterion B). In determining whether the mood disturbance is due to a general\nmedical condition, the clinician must first establish the presence of a general medical con-\ndition. Further, the clinician must establish that the mood disturbance is etiologically re-\nlated to the general medical condition through a physiological mechanism. A careful and\ncomprehensive assessment of multiple factors is necessary to make this judgment. Al-\nthough there are no infallible guidelines for determining whether the relationship\nbetween the mood disturbance and the general medical condition is etiological, several\nconsiderations provide some guidance in this area. One consideration is the presence of a\ntemporal association between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of the general medical\ncondition and that of the mood disturbance. A second consideration is the presence of fea-\ntures that are atypical of primary Mood Disorders (e.g., atypical age at onset or course or\nabsence of family history). Evidence from the literature that suggests that there can be a di-\nrect association between the general medical condition in question and the development\nof mood symptoms can provide a useful context in the assessment of a particular situation.The essential feature of separation anxiety disorder is excessive fear or anxiety concerning\nseparation from home or attachment figures. The anxiety exceeds what may be expected\ngiven the person’s developmental level (Criterion A). Individuals with separation anxiety\ndisorder have symptoms that meet at least three of the following criteria: They experience\nrecurrent excessive distress when separation from home or major attachment figures is an-\nticipated or occurs (Criterion A1). They worry about the well-being or death of attachment\nfigures, particularly when separated from them, and they need to know the whereabouts\nof their attachment figures and want to stay in touch with them (Criterion A2). They also\nworry about untoward events to themselves, such as getting lost, being kidnapped, or\nhaving an accident, that would keep them from ever being reunited with their major at-\ntachment figure (Criterion A3). Individuals with separation anxiety disorder are reluctant\nor refuse to go out by themselves because of separation fears (Criterion A4). They have\npersistent and excessive fear or reluctance about being alone or without major attachment\nfigures at home or in other settings. Children with separation anxiety disorder may be un-\nable to stay or go in a room by themselves and may display “clinging” behavior, staying\nclose to or “shadowing” the parent around the house, or requiring someone to be with\nthem when going to another room in the house (Criterion A5). They have persistent reluc-\ntance or refusal to go to sleep without being near a major attachment figure or to sleep\naway from home (Criterion A6). Children with this disorder often have difficulty at bed-\ntime and may insist that someone stay with them until they fall asleep. During the night,\nthey may make their way to their parents’ bed (or that of a significant other, such as a sib-\nling). Children may be reluctant or refuse to attend camp, to sleep at friends’ homes, or to\ngo on errands. Adults may be uncomfortable when traveling independently (e.g., sleeping\nin a hotel room). There may be repeated nightmares in which the content expresses the in-\n192\nAnxiety Disorders\ndividual’s separation anxiety (e.g., destruction of the family through fire, murder, or other\ncatastrophe) (Criterion A7). Physical symptoms (e.g., headaches, abdominal complaints,\nnausea, vomiting) are common in children when separation from major attachment fig-\nures occurs or is anticipated (Criterion A8). Cardiovascular symptoms such as palpitations,\ndizziness, and feeling faint are rare in younger children but may occur in adolescents and\nadults.\nThe disturbance must last for a period of at least 4 weeks in children and adolescents\nyounger than 18 years and is typically 6 months or longer in adults (Criterion B). However,\nthe duration criterion for adults should be used as a general guide, with allowance for\nsome degree of flexibility. The disturbance must cause clinically significant distress or im-\npairment in social, academic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Cri-\nterion C).When encountering other individuals in social interactions, children with selective mut-\nism do not initiate speech or reciprocally respond when spoken to by others. Lack of\nspeech occurs in social interactions with children or adults. Children with selective mut-\nism will speak in their home in the presence of immediate family members but often not\neven in front of close friends or second-degree relatives, such as grandparents or cousins.\nThe disturbance is often marked by high social anxiety. Children with selective mutism of-\nten refuse to speak at school, leading to academic or educational impairment, as teachers\noften find it difficult to assess skills such as reading. The lack of speech may interfere with\nsocial communication, although children with this disorder sometimes use nonspoken or\nnonverbal means (e.g., grunting, pointing, writing) to communicate and may be willing or\neager to perform or engage in social encounters when speech is not required (e.g., nonver-\nbal parts in school plays).A key feature of this disorder is that the fear or anxiety is circumscribed to the presence of a\nparticular situation or object (Criterion A), which may be termed the phobic stimulus. The cat-\negories of feared situations or objects are provided as specifiers. Many individuals fear objects\nor situations from more than one category, or phobic stimulus. For the diagnosis of specific\nphobia, the response must differ from normal, transient fears that commonly occur in the pop-\nulation. To meet the criteria for a diagnosis, the fear or anxiety must be intense or severe (i.e.,\n“marked”) (Criterion A). The amount of fear experienced may vary with proximity to the\nfeared object or situation and may occur in anticipation of or in the actual presence of the object\nor situation. Also, the fear or anxiety may take the form of a full or limited symptom panic at-\ntack (i.e., expected panic attack). Another characteristic of specific phobias is that fear or anxi-\nety is evoked nearly every time the individual comes into contact with the phobic stimulus\n(Criterion B). Thus, an individual who becomes anxious only occasionally upon being con-\nfronted with the situation or object (e.g., becomes anxious when flying only on one out of every\nfive airplane flights) would not be diagnosed with specific phobia. However, the degree of fear\nor anxiety expressed may vary (from anticipatory anxiety to a full panic attack) across different\noccasions of encountering the phobic object or situation because of various contextual factors\nsuch as the presence of others, duration of exposure, and other threatening elements such as\nturbulence on a flight for individuals who fear flying. Fear and anxiety are often expressed dif-\nferently between children and adults. Also, the fear or anxiety occurs as soon as the phobic ob-\nject or situation is encountered (i.e., immediately rather than being delayed).\nThe individual actively avoids the situation, or if he or she either is unable or decides\nnot to avoid it, the situation or object evokes intense fear or anxiety (Criterion C). Active\navoidance means the individual intentionally behaves in ways that are designed to prevent\nor minimize contact with phobic objects or situations (e.g., takes tunnels instead of bridges\non daily commute to work for fear of heights; avoids entering a dark room for fear of spi-\nders; avoids accepting a job in a locale where a phobic stimulus is more common). Avoid-\nSpecific Phobia\n199\nance behaviors are often obvious (e.g., an individual who fears blood refusing to go to the\ndoctor) but are sometimes less obvious (e.g., an individual who fears snakes refusing to\nlook at pictures that resemble the form or shape of snakes). Many individuals with specific\nphobias have suffered over many years and have changed their living circumstances in\nways designed to avoid the phobic object or situation as much as possible (e.g., an indi-\nvidual diagnosed with specific phobia, animal, who moves to reside in an area devoid of\nthe particular feared animal). Therefore, they no longer experience fear or anxiety in their\ndaily life. In such instances, avoidance behaviors or ongoing refusal to engage in activities\nthat would involve exposure to the phobic object or situation (e.g., repeated refusal to ac-\ncept offers for work-related travel because of fear of flying) may be helpful in confirming\nthe diagnosis in the absence of overt anxiety or panic.\nThe fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger that the object or situation\nposes, or more intense than is deemed necessary (Criterion D). Although individuals with\nspecific phobia often recognize their reactions as disproportionate, they tend to overesti-\nmate the danger in their feared situations, and thus the judgment of being out of propor-\ntion is made by the clinician. The individual’s sociocultural context should also be taken\ninto account. For example, fears of the dark may be reasonable in a context of ongoing\nviolence, and fear of insects may be more disproportionate in settings where insects are\nconsumed in the diet. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for\n6 months or more (Criterion E), which helps distinguish the disorder from transient fears\nthat are common in the population, particularly among children. However, the duration\ncriterion should be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility.\nThe specific phobia must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-\ncupational, or other important areas of functioning in order for the disorder to be diag-\nnosed (Criterion F).The essential feature of social anxiety disorder is a marked, or intense, fear or anxiety of so-\ncial situations in which the individual may be scrutinized by others. In children the fear or\nanxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults (Criterion\nA). When exposed to such social situations, the individual fears that he or she will be neg-\natively evaluated. The individual is concerned that he or she will be judged as anxious,\nweak, crazy, stupid, boring, intimidating, dirty, or unlikable. The individual fears that\nhe or she will act or appear in a certain way or show anxiety symptoms, such as blushing,\ntrembling, sweating, stumbling over one’s words, or staring, that will be negatively eval-\nuated by others (Criterion B). Some individuals fear offending others or being rejected as\na result. Fear of offending others—for example, by a gaze or by showing anxiety symp-\ntoms—may be the predominant fear in individuals from cultures with strong collectivistic\norientations. An individual with fear of trembling of the hands may avoid drinking, eat-\ning, writing, or pointing in public; an individual with fear of sweating may avoid shaking\nhands or eating spicy foods; and an individual with fear of blushing may avoid public per-\nformance, bright lights, or discussion about intimate topics. Some individuals fear and\navoid urinating in public restrooms when other individuals are present (i.e., paruresis, or\n“shy bladder syndrome”).\nThe social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety (Criterion C). Thus, an in-\ndividual who becomes anxious only occasionally in the social situation(s) would not be di-\nagnosed with social anxiety disorder. However, the degree and type of fear and anxiety\nmay vary (e.g., anticipatory anxiety, a panic attack) across different occasions. The antici-\npatory anxiety may occur sometimes far in advance of upcoming situations (e.g., worrying\nevery day for weeks before attending a social event, repeating a speech for days in advance).\nIn children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, or\nshrinking in social situations. The individual will often avoid the feared social situations.\nAlternatively, the situations are endured with intense fear or anxiety (Criterion D). Avoid-\n204\nAnxiety Disorders\nance can be extensive (e.g., not going to parties, refusing school) or subtle (e.g., overpre-\nparing the text of a speech, diverting attention to others, limiting eye contact).\nThe fear or anxiety is judged to be out of proportion to the actual risk of being nega-\ntively evaluated or to the consequences of such negative evaluation (Criterion E). Some-\ntimes, the anxiety may not be judged to be excessive, because it is related to an actual\ndanger (e.g., being bullied or tormented by others). However, individuals with social anx-\niety disorder often overestimate the negative consequences of social situations, and thus\nthe judgment of being out of proportion is made by the clinician. The individual’s socio-\ncultural context needs to be taken into account when this judgment is being made. For ex-\nample, in certain cultures, behavior that might otherwise appear socially anxious may be\nconsidered appropriate in social situations (e.g., might be seen as a sign of respect).\nThe duration of the disturbance is typically at least 6 months (Criterion F). This dura-\ntion threshold helps distinguish the disorder from transient social fears that are com-\nmon, particularly among children and in the community. However, the duration criterion\nshould be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility. The fear,\nanxiety, and avoidance must interfere significantly with the individual’s normal routine,\noccupational or academic functioning, or social activities or relationships, or must cause\nclinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important ar-\neas of functioning (Criterion G). For example, an individual who is afraid to speak in pub-\nlic would not receive a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder if this activity is not routinely\nencountered on the job or in classroom work, and if the individual is not significantly dis-\ntressed about it. However, if the individual avoids, or is passed over for, the job or educa-\ntion he or she really wants because of social anxiety symptoms, Criterion G is met.Panic disorder refers to recurrent unexpected panic attacks (Criterion A). A panic attack is\nan abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes,\nand during which time four or more of a list of 13 physical and cognitive symptoms occur.\nThe term recurrent literally means more than one unexpected panic attack. The term unex-\npected refers to a panic attack for which there is no obvious cue or trigger at the time of oc-\ncurrence—that is, the attack appears to occur from out of the blue, such as when the\nindividual is relaxing or emerging from sleep (nocturnal panic attack). In contrast, expected\npanic attacks are attacks for which there is an obvious cue or trigger, such as a situation in\nwhich panic attacks typically occur. The determination of whether panic attacks are ex-\npected or unexpected is made by the clinician, who makes this judgment based on a com-\nbination of careful questioning as to the sequence of events preceding or leading up to the\nattack and the individual’s own judgment of whether or not the attack seemed to occur for\nno apparent reason. Cultural interpretations may influence the assignment of panic at-\ntacks as expected or unexpected (see section “Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues” for this\ndisorder). In the United States and Europe, approximately one-half of individuals with\npanic disorder have expected panic attacks as well as unexpected panic attacks. Thus, the\npresence of expected panic attacks does not rule out the diagnosis of panic disorder. For\nmore details regarding expected versus unexpected panic attacks, see the text accompa-\nnying panic attacks (pp. 214–217).\nThe frequency and severity of panic attacks vary widely. In terms of frequency, there\nmay be moderately frequent attacks (e.g., one per week) for months at a time, or short\nbursts of more frequent attacks (e.g., daily) separated by weeks or months without any at-\ntacks or with less frequent attacks (e.g., two per month) over many years. Persons who\nhave infrequent panic attacks resemble persons with more frequent panic attacks in terms\nof panic attack symptoms, demographic characteristics, comorbidity with other disorders,\nfamily history, and biological data. In terms of severity, individuals with panic disorder\nmay have both full-symptom (four or more symptoms) and limited-symptom (fewer than\nfour symptoms) attacks, and the number and type of panic attack symptoms frequently\ndiffer from one panic attack to the next. However, more than one unexpected full-symp-\ntom panic attack is required for the diagnosis of panic disorder.\nThe worries about panic attacks or their consequences usually pertain to physical con-\ncerns, such as worry that panic attacks reflect the presence of life-threatening illnesses\n(e.g., cardiac disease, seizure disorder); social concerns, such as embarrassment or fear of\nbeing judged negatively by others because of visible panic symptoms; and concerns about\nmental functioning, such as “going crazy” or losing control (Criterion B). The maladaptive\nchanges in behavior represent attempts to minimize or avoid panic attacks or their conse-\nquences. Examples include avoiding physical exertion, reorganizing daily life to ensure\nthat help is available in the event of a panic attack, restricting usual daily activities, and\navoiding agoraphobia-type situations, such as leaving home, using public transportation,\nor shopping. If agoraphobia is present, a separate diagnosis of agoraphobia is given.\n210\nAnxiety DisordersThe essential feature of agoraphobia is marked, or intense, fear or anxiety triggered by the\nreal or anticipated exposure to a wide range of situations (Criterion A). The diagnosis re-\nquires endorsement of symptoms occurring in at least two of the following five situations:\n1) using public transporation, such as automobiles, buses, trains, ships, or planes; 2) being\nin open spaces, such as parking lots, marketplaces, or bridges; 3) being in enclosed spaces,\nsuch as shops, theaters, or cinemas; 4) standing in line or being in a crowd; or 5) being out-\nside of the home alone. The examples for each situation are not exhaustive; other situations\nmay be feared. When experiencing fear and anxiety cued by such situations, individuals\ntypically experience thoughts that something terrible might happen (Criterion B). Individ-\nuals frequently believe that escape from such situations might be difficult (e.g., “can’t get\nout of here”) or that help might be unavailable (e.g., “there is nobody to help me”) when\npanic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms occur. “Panic-like\nsymptoms” refer to any of the 13 symptoms included in the criteria for panic attack, such as\ndizziness, faintness, and fear of dying. “Other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms”\ninclude symptoms such as vomiting and inflammatory bowel symptoms, as well as, in\nolder adults, a fear of falling or, in children, a sense of disorientation and getting lost.\nThe amount of fear experienced may vary with proximity to the feared situation and\nmay occur in anticipation of or in the actual presence of the agoraphobic situation. Also,\nthe fear or anxiety may take the form of a full- or limited-symptom panic attack (i.e., an ex-\npected panic attack). Fear or anxiety is evoked nearly every time the individual comes into\ncontact with the feared situation (Criterion C). Thus, an individual who becomes anxious\nonly occasionally in an agoraphobic situation (e.g., becomes anxious when standing in line\non only one out of every five occasions) would not be diagnosed with agoraphobia. The in-\ndividual actively avoids the situation or, if he or she either is unable or decides not to avoid\nit, the situation evokes intense fear or anxiety (Criterion D). Active avoidance means the in-\ndividual is currently behaving in ways that are intentionally designed to prevent or min-\nimize contact with agoraphobic situations. Avoidance can be behavioral (e.g., changing\nAgoraphobia\n219\ndaily routines, choosing a job nearby to avoid using public transportation, arranging for\nfood delivery to avoid entering shops and supermarkets) as well as cognitive (e.g., using\ndistraction to get through agoraphobic situations) in nature. The avoidance can become so\nsevere that the person is completely homebound. Often, an individual is better able to con-\nfront a feared situation when accompanied by a companion, such as a partner, friend, or\nhealth professional.\nThe fear, anxiety, or avoidance must be out of proportion to the actual danger posed by\nthe agoraphobic situations and to the sociocultural context (Criterion E). Differentiating\nclinically significant agoraphobic fears from reasonable fears (e.g., leaving the house dur-\ning a bad storm) or from situations that are deemed dangerous (e.g., walking in a parking\nlot or using public transportation in a high-crime area) is important for a number of reasons.\nFirst, what constitutes avoidance may be difficult to judge across cultures and sociocultural\ncontexts (e.g., it is socioculturally appropriate for orthodox Muslim women in certain parts\nof the world to avoid leaving the house alone, and thus such avoidance would not be con-\nsidered indicative of agoraphobia). Second, older adults are likely to overattribute their\nfears to age-related constraints and are less likely to judge their fears as being out of pro-\nportion to the actual risk. Third, individuals with agoraphobia are likely to overestimate\ndanger in relation to panic-like or other bodily symptoms. Agoraphobia should be diag-\nnosed only if the fear, anxiety, or avoidance persists (Criterion F) and if it causes clinically\nsignificant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of func-\ntioning (Criterion G). The duration of “typically lasting for 6 months or more” is meant to\nexclude individuals with short-lived, transient problems. However, the duration criterion\nshould be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility.The essential feature of generalized anxiety disorder is excessive anxiety and worry (ap-\nprehensive expectation) about a number of events or activities. The intensity, duration, or\nfrequency of the anxiety and worry is out of proportion to the actual likelihood or impact\nof the anticipated event. The individual finds it difficult to control the worry and to keep\nworrisome thoughts from interfering with attention to tasks at hand. Adults with gener-\nalized anxiety disorder often worry about everyday, routine life circumstances, such as\npossible job responsibilities, health and finances, the health of family members, misfor-\ntune to their children, or minor matters (e.g., doing household chores or being late for ap-\npointments). Children with generalized anxiety disorder tend to worry excessively about\ntheir competence or the quality of their performance. During the course of the disorder,\nthe focus of worry may shift from one concern to another.\nSeveral features distinguish generalized anxiety disorder from nonpathological anxiety.\nFirst, the worries associated with generalized anxiety disorder are excessive and typically in-\nterfere significantly with psychosocial functioning, whereas the worries of everyday life\nare not excessive and are perceived as more manageable and may be put off when more\npressing matters arise. Second, the worries associated with generalized anxiety disorder are\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder\n223\nmore pervasive, pronounced, and distressing; have longer duration; and frequently occur\nwithout precipitants. The greater the range of life circumstances about which a person\nworries (e.g., finances, children’s safety, job performance), the more likely his or her symp-\ntoms are to meet criteria for generalized anxiety disorder. Third, everyday worries are much\nless likely to be accompanied by physical symptoms (e.g., restlessness or feeling keyed up\nor on edge). Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder report subjective distress due\nto constant worry and related impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas\nof functioning.\nThe anxiety and worry are accompanied by at least three of the following additional\nsymptoms: restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty\nconcentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension, and disturbed sleep, al-\nthough only one additional symptom is required in children.The essential features of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder are prominent\nsymptoms of panic or anxiety (Criterion A) that are judged to be due to the effects of a sub-\nstance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, or a toxin exposure). The panic or anxiety symp-\ntoms must have developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or\nafter exposure to a medication, and the substances or medications must be capable of pro-\nducing the symptoms (Criterion B2). Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder\ndue to a prescribed treatment for a mental disorder or another medical condition must\nhave its onset while the individual is receiving the medication (or during withdrawal, if a\nwithdrawal is associated with the medication). Once the treatment is discontinued, the\npanic or anxiety symptoms will usually improve or remit within days to several weeks to\na month (depending on the half-life of the substance/medication and the presence of with-\ndrawal). The diagnosis of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder should not be\ngiven if the onset of the panic or anxiety symptoms precedes the substance/medication in-\ntoxication or withdrawal, or if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (i.e.,\nusually longer than 1 month) from the time of severe intoxication or withdrawal. If the\npanic or anxiety symptoms persist for substantial periods of time, other causes for the\nsymptoms should be considered.\nThe substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder diagnosis should be made in-\nstead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the\nsymptoms in Criterion A are predominant in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe\nto warrant independent clinical attention.The essential feature of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition is clinically signifi-\ncant anxiety that is judged to be best explained as a physiological effect of another medical con-\ndition. Symptoms can include prominent anxiety symptoms or panic attacks (Criterion A).\nThe judgment that the symptoms are best explained by the associated physical condition must\nbe based on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings (Criterion\nB). Additionally, it must be judged that the symptoms are not better accounted for by another\nmental disorder, in particular, adjustment disorder, with anxiety, in which the stressor is the\nmedical condition (Criterion C). In this case, an individual with adjustment disorder is espe-\ncially distressed about the meaning or the consequences of the associated medical condition.\nBy contrast, there is often a prominent physical component to the anxiety (e.g., shortness of\nbreath) when the anxiety is due to another medical condition. The diagnosis is not made if the\nanxiety symptoms occur only during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The anxiety symp-\ntoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other\nimportant areas of functioning (Criterion E).\nIn determining whether the anxiety symptoms are attributable to another medical con-\ndition, the clinician must first establish the presence of the medical condition. Further-\nmore, it must be established that anxiety symptoms can be etiologically related to the\nmedical condition through a physiological mechanism before making a judgment that this\nis the best explanation for the symptoms in a specific individual. A careful and compre-\nAnxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\n231\nhensive assessment of multiple factors is necessary to make this judgment. Several aspects\nof the clinical presentation should be considered: 1) the presence of a clear temporal asso-\nciation between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of the medical condition and the anx-\niety symptoms; 2) the presence of features that are atypical of a primary anxiety disorder\n(e.g., atypical age at onset or course); and 3) evidence in the literature that a known phys-\niological mechanism (e.g., hyperthyroidism) causes anxiety. In addition, the disturbance\nmust not be better explained by a primary anxiety disorder, a substance/medication-\ninduced anxiety disorder, or another primary mental disorder (e.g., adjustment disorder).The characteristic symptoms of OCD are the presence of obsessions and compulsions (Cri-\nterion A). Obsessions are repetitive and persistent thoughts (e.g., of contamination), images\n(e.g., of violent or horrific scenes), or urges (e.g., to stab someone). Importantly, obsessions\nare not pleasurable or experienced as voluntary: they are intrusive and unwanted and\ncause marked distress or anxiety in most individuals. The individual attempts to ignore or\nsuppress these obsessions (e.g., avoiding triggers or using thought suppression) or to neu-\ntralize them with another thought or action (e.g., performing a compulsion). Compulsions\n(or rituals) are repetitive behaviors (e.g., washing, checking) or mental acts (e.g., counting,\nrepeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an\nobsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly. Most individuals with OCD\nhave both obsessions and compulsions. Compulsions are typically performed in response\nto an obsession (e.g., thoughts of contamination leading to washing rituals or that some-\nthing is incorrect leading to repeating rituals until it feels “just right”). The aim is to reduce\nthe distress triggered by obsessions or to prevent a feared event (e.g., becoming ill). How-\never, these compulsions either are not connected in a realistic way to the feared event (e.g.,\narranging items symmetrically to prevent harm to a loved one) or are clearly excessive\n(e.g., showering for hours each day). Compulsions are not done for pleasure, although some\nindividuals experience relief from anxiety or distress.\nCriterion B emphasizes that obsessions and compulsions must be time-consuming (e.g.,\nmore than 1 hour per day) or cause clinically significant distress or impairment to warrant\na diagnosis of OCD. This criterion helps to distinguish the disorder from the occasional in-\ntrusive thoughts or repetitive behaviors that are common in the general population (e.g.,\ndouble-checking that a door is locked). The frequency and severity of obsessions and com-\npulsions vary across individuals with OCD (e.g., some have mild to moderate symptoms,\nspending 1–3 hours per day obsessing or doing compulsions, whereas others have nearly\nconstant intrusive thoughts or compulsions that can be incapacitating).Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder (formerly known as dysmorphophobia) are pre-\noccupied with one or more perceived defects or flaws in their physical appearance, which\nthey believe look ugly, unattractive, abnormal, or deformed (Criterion A). The perceived\nflaws are not observable or appear only slight to other individuals. Concerns range from\nlooking “unattractive” or “not right” to looking “hideous” or “like a monster.” Preoccu-\npations can focus on one or many body areas, most commonly the skin (e.g., perceived\nacne, scars, lines, wrinkles, paleness), hair (e.g., “thinning” hair or “excessive” body or fa-\ncial hair), or nose (e.g., size or shape). However, any body area can be the focus of concern\n(e.g., eyes, teeth, weight, stomach, breasts, legs, face size or shape, lips, chin, eyebrows,\ngenitals). Some individuals are concerned about perceived asymmetry of body areas. The\npreoccupations are intrusive, unwanted, time-consuming (occurring, on average, 3–8\nhours per day), and usually difficult to resist or control.\nExcessive repetitive behaviors or mental acts (e.g., comparing) are performed in re-\nsponse to the preoccupation (Criterion B). The individual feels driven to perform these be-\nhaviors, which are not pleasurable and may increase anxiety and dysphoria. They are\ntypically time-consuming and difficult to resist or control. Common behaviors are com-\nparing one’s appearance with that of other individuals; repeatedly checking perceived\ndefects in mirrors or other reflecting surfaces or examining them directly; excessively\ngrooming (e.g., combing, styling, shaving, plucking, or pulling hair); camouflaging (e.g.,\nrepeatedly applying makeup or covering disliked areas with such things as a hat, clothing,\nmakeup, or hair); seeking reassurance about how the perceived flaws look; touching dis-\nliked areas to check them; excessively exercising or weight lifting; and seeking cosmetic\nprocedures. Some individuals excessively tan (e.g., to darken “pale” skin or diminish per-\nceived acne), repeatedly change their clothes (e.g., to camouflage perceived defects), or\ncompulsively shop (e.g., for beauty products). Compulsive skin picking intended to\nimprove perceived skin defects is common and can cause skin damage, infections, or\nruptured blood vessels. The preoccupation must cause clinically significant distress or im-\npairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C);\nusually both are present. Body dysmorphic disorder must be differentiated from an eating\ndisorder.\nMuscle dysmorphia, a form of body dysmorphic disorder occurring almost exclusively\nin males, consists of preoccupation with the idea that one’s body is too small or insuffi-\nciently lean or muscular. Individuals with this form of the disorder actually have a nor-\nmal-looking body or are even very muscular. They may also be preoccupied with other\nbody areas, such as skin or hair. A majority (but not all) diet, exercise, and/or lift weights\nexcessively, sometimes causing bodily damage. Some use potentially dangerous anabolic-\n244\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\nandrogenic steroids and other substances to try to make their body bigger and more mus-\ncular. Body dysmorphic disorder by proxy is a form of body dysmorphic disorder in\nwhich individuals are preoccupied with defects they perceive in another person’s appear-\nance.\nInsight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs can range from good to absent/\ndelusional (i.e., delusional beliefs consisting of complete conviction that the individual’s\nview of their appearance is accurate and undistorted). On average, insight is poor; one-\nthird or more of individuals currently have delusional body dysmorphic disorder beliefs.\nIndividuals with delusional body dysmorphic disorder tend to have greater morbidity in\nsome areas (e.g., suicidality), but this appears accounted for by their tendency to have\nmore severe body dysmorphic disorder symptoms.The essential feature of hoarding disorder is persistent difficulties discarding or parting\nwith possessions, regardless of their actual value (Criterion A). The term persistent indi-\ncates a long-standing difficulty rather than more transient life circumstances that may lead\nto excessive clutter, such as inheriting property. The difficulty in discarding possessions\nnoted in Criterion A refers to any form of discarding, including throwing away, selling,\ngiving away, or recycling. The main reasons given for these difficulties are the perceived\nutility or aesthetic value of the items or strong sentimental attachment to the possessions.\nSome individuals feel responsible for the fate of their possessions and often go to great\nlengths to avoid being wasteful. Fears of losing important information are also common.\nThe most commonly saved items are newspapers, magazines, old clothing, bags, books,\nmail, and paperwork, but virtually any item can be saved. The nature of items is not lim-\nited to possessions that most other people would define as useless or of limited value.\nMany individuals collect and save large numbers of valuable things as well, which are of-\nten found in piles mixed with other less valuable items.\nIndividuals with hoarding disorder purposefully save possessions and experience dis-\ntress when facing the prospect of discarding them (Criterion B). This criterion emphasizes\nthat the saving of possessions is intentional, which discriminates hoarding disorder from\nother forms of psychopathology that are characterized by the passive accumulation of\nitems or the absence of distress when possessions are removed.\nIndividuals accumulate large numbers of items that fill up and clutter active living ar-\neas to the extent that their intended use is no longer possible (Criterion C). For example,\nthe individual may not be able to cook in the kitchen, sleep in his or her bed, or sit in a\nchair. If the space can be used, it is only with great difficulty. Clutter is defined as a large\ngroup of usually unrelated or marginally related objects piled together in a disorganized\nfashion in spaces designed for other purposes (e.g., tabletops, floor, hallway). Criterion C\nemphasizes the “active” living areas of the home, rather than more peripheral areas, such\nas garages, attics, or basements, that are sometimes cluttered in homes of individuals with-\nout hoarding disorder. However, individuals with hoarding disorder often have posses-\nsions that spill beyond the active living areas and can occupy and impair the use of other\nspaces, such as vehicles, yards, the workplace, and friends’ and relatives’ houses. In some\ncases, living areas may be uncluttered because of the intervention of third parties (e.g.,\nfamily members, cleaners, local authorities). Individuals who have been forced to clear\ntheir homes still have a symptom picture that meets criteria for hoarding disorder because\nthe lack of clutter is due to a third-party intervention. Hoarding disorder contrasts with\nnormative collecting behavior, which is organized and systematic, even if in some cases\nthe actual amount of possessions may be similar to the amount accumulated by an indi-\nvidual with hoarding disorder. Normative collecting does not produce the clutter, dis-\ntress, or impairment typical of hoarding disorder.\nSymptoms (i.e., difficulties discarding and/or clutter) must cause clinically significant\ndistress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning, in-\ncluding maintaining a safe environment for self and others (Criterion D). In some cases,\nHoarding Disorder\n249\nparticularly when there is poor insight, the individual may not report distress, and the im-\npairment may be apparent only to those around the individual. However, any attempts to\ndiscard or clear the possessions by third parties result in high levels of distress.The essential feature of trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) is the recurrent pulling out\nof one’s own hair (Criterion A). Hair pulling may occur from any region of the body in\nwhich hair grows; the most common sites are the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelids, while less\ncommon sites are axillary, facial, pubic, and peri-rectal regions. Hair-pulling sites may\nvary over time. Hair pulling may occur in brief episodes scattered throughout the day or\nduring less frequent but more sustained periods that can continue for hours, and such hair\n252\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\npulling may endure for months or years. Criterion A requires that hair pulling lead to hair\nloss, although individuals with this disorder may pull hair in a widely distributed pattern\n(i.e., pulling single hairs from all over a site) such that hair loss may not be clearly visible.\nAlternatively, individuals may attempt to conceal or camouflage hair loss (e.g., by using\nmakeup, scarves, or wigs). Individuals with trichotillomania have made repeated at-\ntempts to decrease or stop hair pulling (Criterion B). Criterion C indicates that hair pulling\ncauses clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other impor-\ntant areas of functioning. The term distress includes negative affects that may be experi-\nenced by individuals with hair pulling, such as feeling a loss of control, embarrassment,\nand shame. Significant impairment may occur in several different areas of functioning\n(e.g., social, occupational, academic, and leisure), in part because of avoidance of work,\nschool, or other public situations.The essential feature of excoriation (skin-picking) disorder is recurrent picking at one’s\nown skin (Criterion A). The most commonly picked sites are the face, arms, and hands, but\nmany individuals pick from multiple body sites. Individuals may pick at healthy skin, at\nminor skin irregularities, at lesions such as pimples or calluses, or at scabs from previous\npicking. Most individuals pick with their fingernails, although many use tweezers, pins,\nor other objects. In addition to skin picking, there may be skin rubbing, squeezing, lancing,\nand biting. Individuals with excoriation disorder often spend significant amounts of time\non their picking behavior, sometimes several hours per day, and such skin picking may\nExcoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder\n255\nendure for months or years. Criterion A requires that skin picking lead to skin lesions, al-\nthough individuals with this disorder often attempt to conceal or camouflage such lesions\n(e.g., with makeup or clothing). Individuals with excoriation disorder have made repeated\nattempts to decrease or stop skin picking (Criterion B).\nCriterion C indicates that skin picking causes clinically significant distress or impair-\nment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The term distress in-\ncludes negative affects that may be experienced by individuals with skin picking, such as\nfeeling a loss of control, embarrassment, and shame. Significant impairment may occur in\nseveral different areas of functioning (e.g., social, occupational, academic, and leisure), in\npart because of avoidance of social situations.The essential features of substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related\ndisorder are prominent symptoms of an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (Criterion\nA) that are judged to be attributable to the effects of a substance (e.g., drug of abuse, medica-\ntion). The obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms must have developed during\nor soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication or toxin,\nand the substance/medication must be capable of producing the symptoms (Criterion B). Sub-\nstance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to a prescribed\ntreatment for a mental disorder or general medical condition must have its onset while the in-\ndividual is receiving the medication. Once the treatment is discontinued, the obsessive-com-\npulsive and related disorder symptoms will usually improve or remit within days to several\nweeks to 1 month (depending on the half-life of the substance/medication). The diagnosis of\nsubstance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder should not be\ngiven if onset of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms precedes the sub-\nstance intoxication or medication use, or if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of\ntime, usually longer than 1 month, from the time of severe intoxication or withdrawal. If the\nobsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms persist for a substantial period of time,\nother causes for the symptoms should be considered. The substance/medication-induced ob-\nsessive-compulsive and related disorder diagnosis should be made in addition to a diagnosis\nof substance intoxication only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical\npicture and are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attentionThe essential feature of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical\ncondition is clinically significant obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms that are\njudged to be best explained as the direct pathophysiological consequence of another med-\nical condition. Symptoms can include prominent obsessions, compulsions, preoccu-\npations with appearance, hoarding, hair pulling, skin picking, or other body-focused\nrepetitive behaviors (Criterion A). The judgment that the symptoms are best explained by\nthe associated medical condition must be based on evidence from the history, physical ex-\namination, or laboratory findings (Criterion B). Additionally, it must be judged that the\nsymptoms are not better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion C). The diagno-\nsis is not made if the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms occur only during the\ncourse of a delirium (Criterion D). The obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms must\ncause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other impor-\ntant areas of functioning (Criterion E).\nIn determining whether the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms are attribut-\nable to another medical condition, a relevant medical condition must be present. Further-\nmore, it must be established that obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms can be\netiologically related to the medical condition through a pathophysiological mechanism\nand that this best explains the symptoms in the individual. Although there are no infallible\nguidelines for determining whether the relationship between the obsessive-compulsive\nand related symptoms and the medical condition is etiological, considerations that may\nprovide some guidance in making this diagnosis include the presence of a clear temporal\nassociation between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of the medical condition and the\nobsessive-compulsive and related symptoms; the presence of features that are atypical of\na primary obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (e.g., atypical age at onset or course);\nand evidence in the literature that a known physiological mechanism (e.g., striatal dam-\nage) causes obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms. In addition, the disturbance\ncannot be better explained by a primary obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, a sub-\nstance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, or another men-\ntal disorder.\nThere is some controversy about whether obsessive-compulsive and related disorders\ncan be attributed to Group A streptococcal infection. Sydenham’s chorea is the neurolog-\n262\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\nical manifestation of rheumatic fever, which is in turn due to Group A streptococcal in-\nfection. Sydenham’s chorea is characterized by a combination of motor and nonmotor\nfeatures. Nonmotor features include obsessions, compulsions, attention deficit, and emo-\ntional lability. Although individuals with Sydenham’s chorea may present with non-\nneuropsychiatric features of acute rheumatic fever, such as carditis and arthritis, they may\npresent with obsessive-compulsive disorder–like symptoms; such individuals should\nbe diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical\ncondition.\nPediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infec-\ntions (PANDAS) has been identified as another post-infectious autoimmune disorder\ncharacterized by the sudden onset of obsessions, compulsions, and/or tics accompanied\nby a variety of acute neuropsychiatric symptoms in the absence of chorea, carditis, or ar-\nthritis, after Group A streptococcal infection. Although there is a body of evidence that\nsupports the existence of PANDAS, it remains a controversial diagnosis. Given this ongo-\ning controversy, the description of PANDAS has been modified to eliminate etiological\nfactors and to designate an expanded clinical entity: pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiat-\nric syndrome (PANS) or idiopathic childhood acute neuropsychiatric symptoms (CANS),\nwhich deserves further study.Reactive attachment disorder of infancy or early childhood is characterized by a pattern of\nmarkedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate attachment behaviors, in which a\nchild rarely or minimally turns preferentially to an attachment figure for comfort, support,\nprotection, and nurturance. The essential feature is absent or grossly underdeveloped at-\ntachment between the child and putative caregiving adults. Children with reactive attach-\nment disorder are believed to have the capacity to form selective attachments. However,\nbecause of limited opportunities during early development, they fail to show the behavioral\nmanifestations of selective attachments. That is, when distressed, they show no consistent\neffort to obtain comfort, support, nurturance, or protection from caregivers. Furthermore,\nwhen distressed, children with this disorder do not respond more than minimally to com-\nforting efforts of caregivers. Thus, the disorder is associated with the absence of expected\ncomfort seeking and response to comforting behaviors. As such, children with reactive\nattachment disorder show diminished or absent expression of positive emotions during\nroutine interactions with caregivers. In addition, their emotion regulation capacity is com-\npromised, and they display episodes of negative emotions of fear, sadness, or irritability\nthat are not readily explained. A diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder should not be\nmade in children who are developmentally unable to form selective attachments. For this\nreason, the child must have a developmental age of at least 9 months.The essential feature of disinhibited social engagement disorder is a pattern of behavior\nthat involves culturally inappropriate, overly familiar behavior with relative strangers\n(Criterion A). This overly familiar behavior violates the social boundaries of the culture. A\ndiagnosis of disinhibited social engagement disorder should not be made before children\nare developmentally able to form selective attachments. For this reason, the child must\nhave a developmental age of at least 9 months.The essential feature of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the development of char-\nacteristic symptoms following exposure to one or more traumatic events. Emotional re-\nactions to the traumatic event (e.g., fear, helplessness, horror) are no longer a part of\nCriterion A. The clinical presentation of PTSD varies. In some individuals, fear-based re-\nexperiencing, emotional, and behavioral symptoms may predominate. In others, anhe-\ndonic or dysphoric mood states and negative cognitions may be most distressing. In some\nother individuals, arousal and reactive-externalizing symptoms are prominent, while in\nothers, dissociative symptoms predominate. Finally, some individuals exhibit combina-\ntions of these symptom patterns.\nThe directly experienced traumatic events in Criterion A include, but are not limited\nto, exposure to war as a combatant or civilian, threatened or actual physical assault (e.g.,\nphysical attack, robbery, mugging, childhood physical abuse), threatened or actual sexual\nviolence (e.g., forced sexual penetration, alcohol/drug-facilitated sexual penetration, abu-\nsive sexual contact, noncontact sexual abuse, sexual trafficking), being kidnapped, being\ntaken hostage, terrorist attack, torture, incarceration as a prisoner of war, natural or hu-\nman-made disasters, and severe motor vehicle accidents. For children, sexually violent\nevents may include developmentally inappropriate sexual experiences without physical\nviolence or injury. A life-threatening illness or debilitating medical condition is not neces-\nsarily considered a traumatic event. Medical incidents that qualify as traumatic events in-\nvolve sudden, catastrophic events (e.g., waking during surgery, anaphylactic shock).\nWitnessed events include, but are not limited to, observing threatened or serious injury,\nunnatural death, physical or sexual abuse of another person due to violent assault, domes-\ntic violence, accident, war or disaster, or a medical catastrophe in one’s child (e.g., a life-\nthreatening hemorrhage). Indirect exposure through learning about an event is limited to\nexperiences affecting close relatives or friends and experiences that are violent or acciden-\ntal (e.g., death due to natural causes does not qualify). Such events include violent per-\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder\n275\nsonal assault, suicide, serious accident, and serious injury. The disorder may be especially\nsevere or long-lasting when the stressor is interpersonal and intentional (e.g., torture, sex-\nual violence).\nThe traumatic event can be reexperienced in various ways. Commonly, the individual\nhas recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive recollections of the event (Criterion B1). Intrusive\nrecollections in PTSD are distinguished from depressive rumination in that they apply\nonly to involuntary and intrusive distressing memories. The emphasis is on recurrent\nmemories of the event that usually include sensory, emotional, or physiological behavioral\ncomponents. A common reexperiencing symptom is distressing dreams that replay the\nevent itself or that are representative or thematically related to the major threats involved\nin the traumatic event (Criterion B2). The individual may experience dissociative states\nthat last from a few seconds to several hours or even days, during which components of\nthe event are relived and the individual behaves as if the event were occurring at that mo-\nment (Criterion B3). Such events occur on a continuum from brief visual or other sensory\nintrusions about part of the traumatic event without loss of reality orientation, to complete\nloss of awareness of present surroundings. These episodes, often referred to as “flash-\nbacks,” are typically brief but can be associated with prolonged distress and heightened\narousal. For young children, reenactment of events related to trauma may appear in play\nor in dissociative states. Intense psychological distress (Criterion B4) or physiological re-\nactivity (Criterion B5) often occurs when the individual is exposed to triggering events that\nresemble or symbolize an aspect of the traumatic event (e.g., windy days after a hurricane;\nseeing someone who resembles one’s perpetrator). The triggering cue could be a physical\nsensation (e.g., dizziness for survivors of head trauma; rapid heartbeat for a previously\ntraumatized child), particularly for individuals with highly somatic presentations.\nStimuli associated with the trauma are persistently (e.g., always or almost always)\navoided. The individual commonly makes deliberate efforts to avoid thoughts, memories,\nfeelings, or talking about the traumatic event (e.g., utilizing distraction techniques to avoid\ninternal reminders) (Criterion C1) and to avoid activities, objects, situations, or people\nwho arouse recollections of it (Criterion C2).\nNegative alterations in cognitions or mood associated with the event begin or worsen\nafter exposure to the event. These negative alterations can take various forms, including an\ninability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event; such amnesia is typically\ndue to dissociative amnesia and is not due to head injury, alcohol, or drugs (Criterion D1).\nAnother form is persistent (i.e., always or almost always) and exaggerated negative ex-\npectations regarding important aspects of life applied to oneself, others, or the future (e.g.,\n“I have always had bad judgment”; “People in authority can’t be trusted”) that may man-\nifest as a negative change in perceived identity since the trauma (e.g., “I can’t trust anyone\never again”; Criterion D2). Individuals with PTSD may have persistent erroneous cogni-\ntions about the causes of the traumatic event that lead them to blame themselves or others\n(e.g., “It’s all my fault that my uncle abused me”) (Criterion D3). A persistent negative\nmood state (e.g., fear, horror, anger, guilt, shame) either began or worsened after exposure\nto the event (Criterion D4). The individual may experience markedly diminished interest\nor participation in previously enjoyed activities (Criterion D5), feeling detached or es-\ntranged from other people (Criterion D6), or a persistent inability to feel positive emotions\n(especially happiness, joy, satisfaction, or emotions associated with intimacy, tenderness,\nand sexuality) (Criterion D7).\nIndividuals with PTSD may be quick tempered and may even engage in aggressive\nverbal and/or physical behavior with little or no provocation (e.g., yelling at people, get-\nting into fights, destroying objects) (Criterion E1). They may also engage in reckless or self-\ndestructive behavior such as dangerous driving, excessive alcohol or drug use, or self-\ninjurious or suicidal behavior (Criterion E2).  PTSD is often characterized by a heightened\nsensitivity to potential threats, including those that are related to the traumatic experience\n(e.g., following a motor vehicle accident, being especially sensitive to the threat potentially\n276\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\ncaused by cars or trucks) and those not related to the traumatic event (e.g., being fearful of\nsuffering a heart attack) (Criterion E3). Individuals with PTSD may be very reactive to un-\nexpected stimuli, displaying a heightened startle response, or jumpiness, to loud noises or\nunexpected movements (e.g., jumping markedly in response to a telephone ringing) (Cri-\nterion E4). Concentration difficulties, including difficulty remembering daily events (e.g.,\nforgetting one’s telephone number) or attending to focused tasks (e.g., following a conver-\nsation for a sustained period of time), are commonly reported (Criterion E5). Problems\nwith sleep onset and maintenance are common and may be associated with nightmares\nand safety concerns or with generalized elevated arousal that interferes with adequate sleep\n(Criterion E6). Some individuals also experience persistent dissociative symptoms of de-\ntachment from their bodies (depersonalization) or the world around them (derealization);\nthis is reflected in the “with dissociative symptoms” specifier.The essential feature of acute stress disorder is the development of characteristic symp-\ntoms lasting from 3 days to 1 month following exposure to one or more traumatic events.\nTraumatic events that are experienced directly include, but are not limited to, exposure\nto war as a combatant or civilian, threatened or actual violent personal assault (e.g., sexual\n282\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\nviolence, physical attack, active combat, mugging, childhood physical and/or sexual vio-\nlence, being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attack, torture), natural or human-\nmade disasters (e.g., earthquake, hurricane, airplane crash), and severe accident (e.g.,\nsevere motor vehicle, industrial accident). For children, sexually traumatic events may\ninclude inappropriate sexual experiences without violence or injury. A life-threatening\nillness or debilitating medical condition is not necessarily considered a traumatic event.\nMedical incidents that qualify as traumatic events involve sudden, catastrophic events (e.g.,\nwaking during surgery, anaphylactic shock). Stressful events that do not possess the severe\nand traumatic components of events encompassed by Criterion A may lead to an adjust-\nment disorder but not to acute stress disorder.\nThe clinical presentation of acute stress disorder may vary by individual but typically\ninvolves an anxiety response that includes some form of reexperiencing of or reactivity to\nthe traumatic event. In some individuals, a dissociative or detached presentation can pre-\ndominate, although these individuals typically will also display strong emotional or phys-\niological reactivity in response to trauma reminders. In other individuals, there can be a\nstrong anger response in which reactivity is characterized by irritable or possibly aggres-\nsive responses. The full symptom picture must be present for at least 3 days after the trau-\nmatic event and can be diagnosed only up to 1 month after the event. Symptoms that occur\nimmediately after the event but resolve in less than 3 days would not meet criteria for\nacute stress disorder.\nWitnessed events include, but are not limited to, observing threatened or serious in-\njury, unnatural death, physical or sexual violence inflicted on another individual as a re-\nsult of violent assault, severe domestic violence, severe accident, war, and disaster; it may\nalso include witnessing a medical catastrophe (e.g., a life-threatening hemorrhage) involv-\ning one’s child. Events experienced indirectly through learning about the event are limited\nto close relatives or close friends. Such events must have been violent or accidental—death\ndue to natural causes does not qualify—and include violent personal assault, suicide, se-\nrious accident, or serious injury. The disorder may be especially severe when the stressor\nis interpersonal and intentional (e.g., torture, rape). The likelihood of developing this dis-\norder may increase as the intensity of and physical proximity to the stressor increase.\nThe traumatic event can be reexperienced in various ways. Commonly, the individual\nhas recurrent and intrusive recollections of the event (Criterion B1). The recollections are\nspontaneous or triggered recurrent memories of the event that usually occur in response\nto a stimulus that is reminiscent of the traumatic experience (e.g., the sound of a backfiring\ncar triggering memories of gunshots). These intrusive memories often include sensory\n(e.g., sensing the intense heat that was perceived in a house fire), emotional (e.g., experi-\nencing the fear of believing that one was about to be stabbed), or physiological (e.g., expe-\nriencing the shortness of breath that one suffered during a near-drowning) components.\nDistressing dreams may contain themes that are representative of or thematically re-\nlated to the major threats involved in the traumatic event. (For example, in the case of a\nmotor vehicle accident survivor, the distressing dreams may involve crashing cars gener-\nally; in the case of a combat soldier, the distressing dreams may involve being harmed in\nways other than combat.)\nDissociative states may last from a few seconds to several hours, or even days, during\nwhich components of the event are relived and the individual behaves as though experi-\nencing the event at that moment. While dissociative responses are common during a trau-\nmatic event, only dissociative responses that persist beyond 3 days after trauma exposure\nare considered for the diagnosis of acute stress disorder. For young children, reenactment\nof events related to trauma may appear in play and may include dissociative moments\n(e.g., a child who survives a motor vehicle accident may repeatedly crash toy cars during\nplay in a focused and distressing manner). These episodes, often referred to as flashbacks,\nare typically brief but involve a sense that the traumatic event is occurring in the present\nrather than being remembered in the past and are associated with significant distress.\nAcute Stress Disorder\n283\nSome individuals with the disorder do not have intrusive memories of the event itself,\nbut instead experience intense psychological distress or physiological reactivity when\nthey are exposed to triggering events that resemble or symbolize an aspect of the traumatic\nevent (e.g., windy days for children after a hurricane, entering an elevator for a male or fe-\nmale who was raped in an elevator, seeing someone who resembles one’s perpetrator).\nThe triggering cue could be a physical sensation (e.g., a sense of heat for a burn victim, diz-\nziness for survivors of head trauma), particularly for individuals with highly somatic pre-\nsentations. The individual may have a persistent inability to feel positive emotions (e.g.,\nhappiness, joy, satisfaction, or emotions associated with intimacy, tenderness, or sexual-\nity) but can experience negative emotions such as fear, sadness, anger, guilt, or shame.\nAlterations in awareness can include depersonalization, a detached sense of oneself (e.g.,\nseeing oneself from the other side of the room), or derealization, having a distorted view of\none’s surroundings (e.g., perceiving that things are moving in slow motion, seeing things\nin a daze, not being aware of events that one would normally encode). Some individuals\nalso report an inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event that was\npresumably encoded. This symptom is attributable to dissociative amnesia and is not at-\ntributable to head injury, alcohol, or drugs.\nStimuli associated with the trauma are persistently avoided. The individual may refuse\nto discuss the traumatic experience or may engage in avoidance strategies to minimize\nawareness of emotional reactions (e.g., excessive alcohol use when reminded of the ex-\nperience). This behavioral avoidance may include avoiding watching news coverage of\nthe traumatic experience, refusing to return to a workplace where the trauma occurred, or\navoiding interacting with others who shared the same traumatic experience.\nIt is very common for individuals with acute stress disorder to experience problems\nwith sleep onset and maintenance, which may be associated with nightmares or with gen-\neralized elevated arousal that prevents adequate sleep. Individuals with acute stress dis-\norder may be quick tempered and may even engage in aggressive verbal and/or physical\nbehavior with little provocation. Acute stress disorder is often characterized by a height-\nened sensitivity to potential threats, including those that are related to the traumatic ex-\nperience (e.g., a motor vehicle accident victim may be especially sensitive to the threat\npotentially caused by any cars or trucks) or those not related to the traumatic event (e.g.,\nfear of having a heart attack). Concentration difficulties, including difficulty remembering\ndaily events (e.g., forgetting one’s telephone number) or attending to focused tasks (e.g.,\nfollowing a conversation for a sustained period of time), are commonly reported. Individ-\nuals with acute stress disorder may be very reactive to unexpected stimuli, displaying a\nheightened startle response or jumpiness to loud noises or unexpected movements (e.g.,\nthe individual may jump markedly in the response to a telephone ringing).The presence of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor\nis the essential feature of adjustment disorders (Criterion A). The stressor may be a single\nevent (e.g., a termination of a romantic relationship), or there may be multiple stressors\n(e.g., marked business difficulties and marital problems). Stressors may be recurrent (e.g.,\nassociated with seasonal business crises, unfulfilling sexual relationships) or continuous\n(e.g., a persistent painful illness with increasing disability, living in a crime-ridden neigh-\nborhood). Stressors may affect a single individual, an entire family, or a larger group or\ncommunity (e.g., a natural disaster). Some stressors may accompany specific developmen-\ntal events (e.g., going to school, leaving a parental home, reentering a parental home, get-\nting married, becoming a parent, failing to attain occupational goals, retirement).\nAdjustment disorders may be diagnosed following the death of a loved one when the\nintensity, quality, or persistence of grief reactions exceeds what normally might be ex-\npected, when cultural, religious, or age-appropriate norms are taken into account. A more\nspecific set of bereavement-related symptoms has been designated persistent complex be-\nreavement disorder.\nAdjustment disorders are associated with an increased risk of suicide attempts and\ncompleted suicide.The defining feature of dissociative identity disorder is the presence of two or more dis-\ntinct personality states or an experience of possession (Criterion A). The overtness or\ncovertness of these personality states, however, varies as a function of psychological\nmotivation, current level of stress, culture, internal conflicts and dynamics, and emotional\nresilience. Sustained periods of identity disruption may occur when psychosocial pres-\nsures are severe and/or prolonged. In many possession-form cases of dissociative identity\ndisorder, and in a small proportion of non-possession-form cases, manifestations of alter-\nnate identities are highly overt. Most individuals with non-possession-form dissociative\nidentity disorder do not overtly display their discontinuity of identity for long periods of\ntime; only a small minority present to clinical attention with observable alternation of\nDissociative Identity Disorder\n293\nidentities. When alternate personality states are not directly observed, the disorder can be\nidentified by two clusters of symptoms: 1) sudden alterations or discontinuities in sense of\nself and sense of agency (Criterion A), and 2) recurrent dissociative amnesias (Criterion B).\nCriterion A symptoms are related to discontinuities of experience that can affect any\naspect of an individual’s functioning. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder may\nreport the feeling that they have suddenly become depersonalized observers of their\n“own” speech and actions, which they may feel powerless to stop (sense of self). Such in-\ndividuals may also report perceptions of voices (e.g., a child’s voice; crying; the voice of a\nspiritual being). In some cases, voices are experienced as multiple, perplexing, indepen-\ndent thought streams over which the individual experiences no control. Strong emotions,\nimpulses, and even speech or other actions may suddenly emerge, without a sense of per-\nsonal ownership or control (sense of agency). These emotions and impulses are frequently\nreported as ego-dystonic and puzzling. Attitudes, outlooks, and personal preferences\n(e.g., about food, activities, dress) may suddenly shift and then shift back. Individuals may\nreport that their bodies feel different (e.g., like a small child, like the opposite gender, huge\nand muscular). Alterations in sense of self and loss of personal agency may be accompa-\nnied by a feeling that these attitudes, emotions, and behaviors—even one’s body—are\n“not mine” and/or are “not under my control.” Although most Criterion A symptoms are\nsubjective, many of these sudden discontinuities in speech, affect, and behavior can be wit-\nnessed by family, friends, or the clinician. Non-epileptic seizures and other conversion\nsymptoms are prominent in some presentations of dissociative identity disorder, espe-\ncially in some non-Western settings.\nThe dissociative amnesia of individuals with dissociative identity disorder manifests in\nthree primary ways: as 1) gaps in remote memory of personal life events (e.g., periods of\nchildhood or adolescence; some important life events, such as the death of a grandparent,\ngetting married, giving birth); 2) lapses in dependable memory (e.g., of what happened\ntoday, of well-learned skills such as how to do their job, use a computer, read, drive); and\n3) discovery of evidence of their everyday actions and tasks that they do not recollect do-\ning (e.g., finding unexplained objects in their shopping bags or among their possessions;\nfinding perplexing writings or drawings that they must have created; discovering injuries;\n“coming to” in the midst of doing something). Dissociative fugues, wherein the person\ndiscovers dissociated travel, are common. Thus, individuals with dissociative identity dis-\norder may report that they have suddenly found themselves at the beach, at work, in a night-\nclub, or somewhere at home (e.g., in the closet, on a bed or sofa, in the corner) with no\nmemory of how they came to be there. Amnesia in individuals with dissociative identity dis-\norder is not limited to stressful or traumatic events; these individuals often cannot recall\neveryday events as well.\nIndividuals with dissociative identity disorder vary in their awareness and attitude to-\nward their amnesias. It is common for these individuals to minimize their amnestic symp-\ntoms. Some of their amnestic behaviors may be apparent to others—as when these persons\ndo not recall something they were witnessed to have done or said, when they cannot\nremember their own name, or when they do not recognize their spouse, children, or close\nfriends.\nPossession-form identities in dissociative identity disorder typically manifest as be-\nhaviors that appear as if a “spirit,” supernatural being, or outside person has taken control,\nsuch that the individual begins speaking or acting in a distinctly different manner. For ex-\nample, an individual’s behavior may give the appearance that her identity has been\nreplaced by the “ghost” of a girl who committed suicide in the same community years\nbefore, speaking and acting as though she were still alive. Or an individual may be “taken\nover” by a demon or deity, resulting in profound impairment, and demanding that the in-\ndividual or a relative be punished for a past act, followed by more subtle periods of iden-\ntity alteration. However, the majority of possession states around the world are normal,\nusually part of spiritual practice, and do not meet criteria for dissociative identity disor-\n294\nDissociative Disorders\nder. The identities that arise during possession-form dissociative identity disorder present\nrecurrently, are unwanted and involuntary, cause clinically significant distress or impair-\nment (Criterion C), and are not a normal part of a broadly accepted cultural or religious\npractice (Criterion D).The defining characteristic of dissociative amnesia is an inability to recall important auto-\nbiographical information that 1) should be successfully stored in memory and 2) ordinar-\nily would be readily remembered (Criterion A). Dissociative amnesia differs from the\npermanent amnesias due to neurobiological damage or toxicity that prevent memory stor-\nage or retrieval in that it is always potentially reversible because the memory has been suc-\ncessfully stored.\nLocalized amnesia, a failure to recall events during a circumscribed period of time, is the\nmost common form of dissociative amnesia. Localized amnesia may be broader than am-\nnesia for a single traumatic event (e.g., months or years associated with child abuse or in-\ntense combat). In selective amnesia, the individual can recall some, but not all, of the events\nduring a circumscribed period of time. Thus, the individual may remember part of a trau-\nmatic event but not other parts. Some individuals report both localized and selective am-\nnesias.\nGeneralized amnesia, a complete loss of memory for one’s life history, is rare. Individuals\nwith generalized amnesia may forget personal identity. Some lose previous knowledge\nabout the world (i.e., semantic knowledge) and can no longer access well-learned skills\nDissociative Amnesia\n299\n(i.e., procedural knowledge). Generalized amnesia has an acute onset; the perplexity, dis-\norientation, and purposeless wandering of individuals with generalized amnesia usually\nbring them to the attention of the police or psychiatric emergency services. Generalized\namnesia may be more common among combat veterans, sexual assault victims, and indi-\nviduals experiencing extreme emotional stress or conflict.\nIndividuals with dissociative amnesia are frequently unaware (or only partially aware)\nof their memory problems. Many, especially those with localized amnesia, minimize the\nimportance of their memory loss and may become uncomfortable when prompted to ad-\ndress it. In systematized amnesia, the individual loses memory for a specific category of in-\nformation (e.g., all memories relating to one’s family, a particular person, or childhood\nsexual abuse). In continuous amnesia, an individual forgets each new event as it occurs.The essential features of depersonalization/derealization disorder are persistent or recur-\nrent episodes of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Episodes of depersonalization\nare characterized by a feeling of unreality or detachment from, or unfamiliarity with, one’s\nwhole self or from aspects of the self (Criterion A1). The individual may feel detached\nfrom his or her entire being (e.g., “I am no one,” “I have no self”). He or she may also feel\nsubjectively detached from aspects of the self, including feelings (e.g., hypoemotionality:\nDepersonalization/Derealization Disorder\n303\n“I know I have feelings but I don’t feel them”), thoughts (e.g., “My thoughts don’t feel like\nmy own,” “head filled with cotton”), whole body or body parts, or sensations (e.g., touch,\nproprioception, hunger, thirst, libido). There may also be a diminished sense of agency\n(e.g., feeling robotic, like an automaton; lacking control of one’s speech or movements).\nThe depersonalization experience can sometimes be one of a split self, with one part ob-\nserving and one participating, known as an “out-of-body experience” in its most extreme\nform. The unitary symptom of “depersonalization” consists of several symptom factors:\nanomalous body experiences (i.e., unreality of the self and perceptual alterations); emo-\ntional or physical numbing; and temporal distortions with anomalous subjective recall.\nEpisodes of derealization are characterized by a feeling of unreality or detachment\nfrom, or unfamiliarity with, the world, be it individuals, inanimate objects, or all surround-\nings (Criterion A2). The individual may feel as if he or she were in a fog, dream, or bubble, or\nas if there were a veil or a glass wall between the individual and world around. Surround-\nings may be experienced as artificial, colorless, or lifeless. Derealization is commonly ac-\ncompanied by subjective visual distortions, such as blurriness, heightened acuity, widened\nor narrowed visual field, two-dimensionality or flatness, exaggerated three-dimensional-\nity, or altered distance or size of objects (i.e., macropsia or micropsia). Auditory distortions\ncan also occur, whereby voices or sounds are muted or heightened. In addition, Criterion\nC requires the presence of clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning, and Criteria D and E describe exclusionary\ndiagnoses.Individuals with somatic symptom disorder typically have multiple, current, somatic symp-\ntoms that are distressing or result in significant disruption of daily life (Criterion A), al-\nthough sometimes only one severe symptom, most commonly pain, is present. Symptoms\nmay be specific (e.g., localized pain) or relatively nonspecific (e.g., fatigue). The symptoms\nsometimes represent normal bodily sensations or discomfort that does not generally sig-\nnify serious disease. Somatic symptoms without an evident medical explanation are not\nsufficient to make this diagnosis. The individual’s suffering is authentic, whether or not it\nis medically explained.\nThe symptoms may or may not be associated with another medical condition. The di-\nagnoses of somatic symptom disorder and a concurrent medical illness are not mutually\nexclusive, and these frequently occur together. For example, an individual may become se-\nriously disabled by symptoms of somatic symptom disorder after an uncomplicated myo-\ncardial infarction even if the myocardial infarction itself did not result in any disability. If\nanother medical condition or high risk for developing one is present (e.g., strong family\nhistory), the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors associated with this condition are excessive\n(Criterion B).\nIndividuals with somatic symptom disorder tend to have very high levels of worry\nabout illness (Criterion B). They appraise their bodily symptoms as unduly threatening,\nharmful, or troublesome and often think the worst about their health. Even when there is\nevidence to the contrary, some patients still fear the medical seriousness of their symp-\ntoms. In severe somatic symptom disorder, health concerns may assume a central role in\nthe individual’s life, becoming a feature of his or her identity and dominating interper-\nsonal relationships.\n312\nSomatic Symptom and Related Disorders\nIndividuals typically experience distress that is principally focused on somatic symp-\ntoms and their significance. When asked directly about their distress, some individuals de-\nscribe it in relation to other aspects of their lives, while others deny any source of distress\nother than the somatic symptoms. Health-related quality of life is often impaired, both\nphysically and mentally. In severe somatic symptom disorder, the impairment is marked,\nand when persistent, the disorder can lead to invalidism.\nThere is often a high level of medical care utilization, which rarely alleviates the individ-\nual’s concerns. Consequently, the patient may seek care from multiple doctors for the same\nsymptoms. These individuals often seem unresponsive to medical interventions, and new\ninterventions may only exacerbate the presenting symptoms. Some individuals with the dis-\norder seem unusually sensitive to medication side effects. Some feel that their medical as-\nsessment and treatment have been inadequate.Most individuals with hypochondriasis are now classified as having somatic symptom\ndisorder; however, in a minority of cases, the diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder applies\ninstead. Illness anxiety disorder entails a preoccupation with having or acquiring a seri-\nous, undiagnosed medical illness (Criterion A). Somatic symptoms are not present or, if\npresent, are only mild in intensity (Criterion B). A thorough evaluation fails to identify a\nserious medical condition that accounts for the individual’s concerns. While the concern\nmay be derived from a nonpathological physical sign or sensation, the individual’s dis-\ntress emanates not primarily from the physical complaint itself but rather from his or her\nanxiety about the meaning, significance, or cause of the complaint (i.e., the suspected med-\nical diagnosis). If a physical sign or symptom is present, it is often a normal physiological\nsensation (e.g., orthostatic dizziness), a benign and self-limited dysfunction (e.g., transient\ntinnitus), or a bodily discomfort not generally considered indicative of disease (e.g., belch-\ning). If a diagnosable medical condition is present, the individual’s anxiety and preoccu-\npation are clearly excessive and disproportionate to the severity of the condition (Criterion\nB). Empirical evidence and existing literature pertain to previously defined DSM hypo-\nchondriasis, and it is unclear to what extent and how precisely they apply to the descrip-\ntion of this new diagnosis.\nThe preoccupation with the idea that one is sick is accompanied by substantial anxiety\nabout health and disease (Criterion C). Individuals with illness anxiety disorder are easily\n316\nSomatic Symptom and Related Disorders\nalarmed about illness, such as by hearing about someone else falling ill or reading a health-\nrelated news story. Their concerns about undiagnosed disease do not respond to appro-\npriate medical reassurance, negative diagnostic tests, or benign course. The physician’s at-\ntempts at reassurance and symptom palliation generally do not alleviate the individual’s\nconcerns and may heighten them. Illness concerns assume a prominent place in the indi-\nvidual’s life, affecting daily activities, and may even result in invalidism. Illness becomes\na central feature of the individual’s identity and self-image, a frequent topic of social dis-\ncourse, and a characteristic response to stressful life events. Individuals with the disorder\noften examine themselves repeatedly (e.g., examining one’s throat in the mirror) (Crite-\nrion D). They research their suspected disease excessively (e.g., on the Internet) and re-\npeatedly seek reassurance from family, friends, or physicians. This incessant worrying often\nbecomes frustrating for others and may result in considerable strain within the family. In\nsome cases, the anxiety leads to maladaptive avoidance of situations (e.g., visiting sick\nfamily members) or activities (e.g., exercise) that these individuals fear might jeopardize\ntheir health.Many clinicians use the alternative names of “functional” (referring to abnormal central\nnervous system functioning) or “psychogenic” (referring to an assumed etiology) to de-\nscribe the symptoms of conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disor-\nder). In conversion disorder, there may be one or more symptoms of various types. Motor\nsymptoms include weakness or paralysis; abnormal movements, such as tremor or dys-\ntonic movements; gait abnormalities; and abnormal limb posturing. Sensory symptoms\ninclude altered, reduced, or absent skin sensation, vision, or hearing. Episodes of abnor-\nmal generalized limb shaking with apparent impaired or loss of consciousness may resem-\nble epileptic seizures (also called psychogenic or non-epileptic seizures). There may be\nepisodes of unresponsiveness resembling syncope or coma. Other symptoms include re-\nduced or absent speech volume (dysphonia/aphonia), altered articulation (dysarthria), a\nsensation of a lump in the throat (globus), and diplopia.\nAlthough the diagnosis requires that the symptom is not explained by neurological\ndisease, it should not be made simply because results from investigations are normal or\nbecause the symptom is “bizarre.” There must be clinical findings that show clear evidence\nof incompatibility with neurological disease. Internal inconsistency at examination is one\nway to demonstrate incompatibility (i.e., demonstrating that physical signs elicited\nthrough one examination method are no longer positive when tested a different way). Ex-\namples of such examination findings include\n• Hoover’s sign, in which weakness of hip extension returns to normal strength with con-\ntralateral hip flexion against resistance.\n• Marked weakness of ankle plantar-flexion when tested on the bed in an individual who\nis able to walk on tiptoes;\n• Positive findings on the tremor entrainment test. On this test, a unilateral tremor may\nbe identified as functional if the tremor changes when the individual is distracted away\nfrom it. This may be observed if the individual is asked to copy the examiner in making\na rhythmical movement with their unaffected hand and this causes the functional\ntremor to change such that it copies or “entrains” to the rhythm of the unaffected hand\nor the functional tremor is suppressed, or no longer makes a simple rhythmical move-\nment.\n• In attacks resembling epilepsy or syncope (“psychogenic” non-epileptic attacks), the\noccurrence of closed eyes with resistance to opening or a normal simultaneous electro-\nencephalogram (although this alone does not exclude all forms of epilepsy or syncope).\n• For visual symptoms, a tubular visual field (i.e., tunnel vision).\nIt is important to note that the diagnosis of conversion disorder should be based on the\noverall clinical picture and not on a single clinical finding.The essential feature of psychological factors affecting other medical conditions is the\npresence of one or more clinically significant psychological or behavioral factors that ad-\nversely affect a medical condition by increasing the risk for suffering, death, or disability\n(Criterion B). These factors can adversely affect the medical condition by influencing its\ncourse or treatment, by constituting an additional well-established health risk factor, or by\ninfluencing the underlying pathophysiology to precipitate or exacerbate symptoms or to\nnecessitate medical attention.\nPsychological or behavioral factors include psychological distress, patterns of interper-\nsonal interaction, coping styles, and maladaptive health behaviors, such as denial of symp-\ntoms or poor adherence to medical recommendations. Common clinical examples are\nanxiety-exacerbating asthma, denial of need for treatment for acute chest pain, and manip-\nulation of insulin by an individual with diabetes wishing to lose weight. Many different\npsychological factors have been demonstrated to adversely influence medical conditions—\nfor example, symptoms of depression or anxiety, stressful life events, relationship style,\npersonality traits, and coping styles. The adverse effects can range from acute, with imme-\ndiate medical consequences (e.g., Takotsubo cardiomyopathy) to chronic, occurring over a\nlong period of time (e.g., chronic occupational stress increasing risk for hypertension). Af-\nfected medical conditions can be those with clear pathophysiology (e.g., diabetes, cancer,\ncoronary disease), functional syndromes (e.g., migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, fibro-\nmyalgia), or idiopathic medical symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue, dizziness).\nPsychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions\n323\nThis diagnosis should be reserved for situations in which the effect of the psychological\nfactor on the medical condition is evident and the psychological factor has clinically sig-\nnificant effects on the course or outcome of the medical condition. Abnormal psychologi-\ncal or behavioral symptoms that develop in response to a medical condition are more\nproperly coded as an adjustment disorder (a clinically significant psychological response\nto an identifiable stressor). There must be reasonable evidence to suggest an association\nbetween the psychological factors and the medical condition, although it may often not be\npossible to demonstrate direct causality or the mechanisms underlying the relationship.The essential feature of factitious disorder is the falsification of medical or psychological signs\nand symptoms in oneself or others that are associated with the identified deception. Indi-\nviduals with factitious disorder can also seek treatment for themselves or another following\ninduction of injury or disease. The diagnosis requires demonstrating that the individual is\ntaking surreptitious actions to misrepresent, simulate, or cause signs or symptoms of ill-\nness or injury in the absence of obvious external rewards. Methods of illness falsification\ncan include exaggeration, fabrication, simulation, and induction. While a preexisting med-\nical condition may be present, the deceptive behavior or induction of injury associated\nwith deception causes others to view such individuals (or another) as more ill or impaired,\nand this can lead to excessive clinical intervention. Individuals with factitious disorder\nmight, for example, report feelings of depression and suicidality following the death of a\nspouse despite the death not being true or the individual’s not having a spouse; decep-\ntively report episodes of neurological symptoms (e.g., seizures, dizziness, or blacking out);\nmanipulate a laboratory test (e.g., by adding blood to urine) to falsely indicate an abnor-\nmality; falsify medical records to indicate an illness; ingest a substance (e.g., insulin or\nwarfarin) to induce an abnormal laboratory result or illness; or physically injure them-\nselves or induce illness in themselves or another (e.g., by injecting fecal material to produce\nan abscess or to induce sepsis).The essential feature of pica is the eating of one or more nonnutritive, nonfood substances on a\npersistent basis over a period of at least 1 month (Criterion A) that is severe enough to warrant\nclinical attention. Typical substances ingested tend to vary with age and availability and might\ninclude paper, soap, cloth, hair, string, wool, soil, chalk, talcum powder, paint, gum, metal,\npebbles, charcoal or coal, ash, clay, starch, or ice. The term nonfood is included because the di-\nagnosis of pica does not apply to ingestion of diet products that have minimal nutritional con-\ntent. There is typically no aversion to food in general. The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood\nsubstances must be developmentally inappropriate (Criterion B) and not part of a culturally\nsupported or socially normative practice (Criterion C). A minimum age of 2 years is suggested\nfor a pica diagnosis to exclude developmentally normal mouthing of objects by infants that re-\nsults in ingestion. The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances can be an associated feature\nof other mental disorders (e.g., intellectual disability [intellectual developmental disorder],\nautism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia). If the eating behavior occurs exclusively in the con-\ntext of another mental disorder, a separate diagnosis of pica should be made only if the eating\nbehavior is sufficiently severe to warrant additional clinical attention (Criterion D).The essential feature of rumination disorder is the repeated regurgitation of food occur-\nring after feeding or eating over a period of at least 1 month (Criterion A). Previously swal-\nlowed food that may be partially digested is brought up into the mouth without apparent\nnausea, involuntary retching, or disgust. The food may be re-chewed and then ejected\nfrom the mouth or re-swallowed. Regurgitation in rumination disorder should be fre-\nquent, occurring at least several times per week, typically daily. The behavior is not better\nexplained by an associated gastrointestinal or other medical condition (e.g., gastroesoph-\nageal reflux, pyloric stenosis) (Criterion B) and does not occur exclusively during the\ncourse of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, or avoidant/restric-\ntive food intake disorder (Criterion C). If the symptoms occur in the context of another\nmental disorder (e.g., intellectual disability [intellectual developmental disorder], neuro-\ndevelopmental disorder), they must be sufficiently severe to warrant additional clinical\nattention (Criterion D) and should represent a primary aspect of the individual’s presen-\ntation requiring intervention. The disorder may be diagnosed across the life span, par-\nticularly in individuals who also have intellectual disability. Many individuals with\nrumination disorder can be directly observed engaging in the behavior by the clinician. In\nother instances diagnosis can be made on the basis of self-report or corroborative informa-\ntion from parents or caregivers. Individuals may describe the behavior as habitual or out-\nside of their control.Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder replaces and extends the DSM-IV diagnosis of\nfeeding disorder of infancy or early childhood. The main diagnostic feature of avoidant/\nrestrictive food intake disorder is avoidance or restriction of food intake (Criterion A)\nmanifested by clinically significant failure to meet requirements for nutrition or insuffi-\ncient energy intake through oral intake of food. One or more of the following key features\nmust be present: significant weight loss, significant nutritional deficiency (or related\nhealth impact), dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements, or marked\ninterference with psychosocial functioning. The determination of whether weight loss is\nsignificant (Criterion A1) is a clinical judgment; instead of losing weight, children and ad-\nolescents who have not completed growth may not maintain weight or height increases\nalong their developmental trajectory.\nDetermination of significant nutritional deficiency (Criterion A2) is also based on clin-\nical assessment (e.g., assessment of dietary intake, physical examination, and laboratory\ntesting), and related impact on physical health can be of a similar severity to that seen in\nanorexia nervosa (e.g., hypothermia, bradycardia, anemia). In severe cases, particularly in\ninfants, malnutrition can be life threatening. “Dependence” on enteral feeding or oral nu-\ntritional supplements (Criterion A3) means that supplementary feeding is required to sus-\ntain adequate intake. Examples of individuals requiring supplementary feeding include\ninfants with failure to thrive who require nasogastric tube feeding, children with neuro-\ndevelopmental disorders who are dependent on nutritionally complete supplements, and\nindividuals who rely on gastrostomy tube feeding or complete oral nutrition supplements\nin the absence of an underlying medical condition. Inability to participate in normal social\nAvoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder\n335\nactivities, such as eating with others, or to sustain relationships as a result of the distur-\nbance would indicate marked interference with psychosocial functioning (Criterion A4).\nAvoidant/restrictive food intake disorder does not include avoidance or restriction of\nfood intake related to lack of availability of food or to cultural practices (e.g., religious fast-\ning or normal dieting) (Criterion B), nor does it include developmentally normal behaviors\n(e.g., picky eating in toddlers, reduced intake in older adults). The disturbance is not better\nexplained by excessive concern about body weight or shape (Criterion C) or by concurrent\nmedical factors or mental disorders (Criterion D).\nIn some individuals, food avoidance or restriction may be based on the sensory char-\nacteristics of qualities of food, such as extreme sensitivity to appearance, color, smell,\ntexture, temperature, or taste. Such behavior has been described as “restrictive eating,”\n“selective eating,” “choosy eating,” “perseverant eating,” “chronic food refusal,” and\n“food neophobia” and may manifest as refusal to eat particular brands of foods or to tol-\nerate the smell of food being eaten by others. Individuals with heightened sensory sensi-\ntivities associated with autism may show similar behaviors.\nFood avoidance or restriction may also represent a conditioned negative response as-\nsociated with food intake following, or in anticipation of, an aversive experience, such as\nchoking; a traumatic investigation, usually involving the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., esoph-\nagoscopy); or repeated vomiting. The terms functional dysphagia and globus hystericus have\nalso been used for such conditions.There are three essential features of anorexia nervosa: persistent energy intake restriction;\nintense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes\nwith weight gain; and a disturbance in self-perceived weight or shape. The individual main-\ntains a body weight that is below a minimally normal level for age, sex, developmental tra-\njectory, and physical health (Criterion A). Individuals’ body weights frequently meet this\ncriterion following a significant weight loss, but among children and adolescents, there\nmay alternatively be failure to make expected weight gain or to maintain a normal devel-\nopmental trajectory (i.e., while growing in height) instead of weight loss.\n340\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\nCriterion A requires that the individual’s weight be significantly low (i.e., less than\nminimally normal or, for children and adolescents, less than that minimally expected).\nWeight assessment can be challenging because normal weight range differs among indi-\nviduals, and different thresholds have been published defining thinness or underweight\nstatus. Body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms/height in meters2) is a\nuseful measure to assess body weight for height. For adults, a BMI of 18.5 kg/m2 has been\nemployed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) as the lower limit of normal body weight. Therefore, most adults with\na BMI greater than or equal to 18.5 kg/m2 would not be considered to have a significantly\nlow body weight. On the other hand, a BMI of lower than 17.0 kg/m2 has been considered\nby the WHO to indicate moderate or severe thinness; therefore, an individual with a BMI\nless than 17.0 kg/m2 would likely be considered to have a significantly low weight. An\nadult with a BMI between 17.0 and 18.5 kg/m2, or even above 18.5 kg/m2, might be consid-\nered to have a significantly low weight if clinical history or other physiological informa-\ntion supports this judgment.\nFor children and adolescents, determining a BMI-for-age percentile is useful (see, e.g.,\nthe CDC BMI percentile calculator for children and teenagers. As for adults, it is not pos-\nsible to provide definitive standards for judging whether a child’s or an adolescent’s weight\nis significantly low, and variations in developmental trajectories among youth limit the\nutility of simple numerical guidelines. The CDC has used a BMI-for-age below the 5th per-\ncentile as suggesting underweight; however, children and adolescents with a BMI above\nthis benchmark may be judged to be significantly underweight in light of failure to main-\ntain their expected growth trajectory. In summary, in determining whether Criterion A is\nmet, the clinician should consider available numerical guidelines, as well as the individual’s\nbody build, weight history, and any physiological disturbances.\nIndividuals with this disorder typically display an intense fear of gaining weight or of\nbecoming fat (Criterion B). This intense fear of becoming fat is usually not alleviated by\nweight loss. In fact, concern about weight gain may increase even as weight falls. Younger\nindividuals with anorexia nervosa, as well as some adults, may not recognize or acknowl-\nedge a fear of weight gain. In the absence of another explanation for the significantly low\nweight, clinician inference drawn from collateral history, observational data, physical and\nlaboratory findings, or longitudinal course either indicating a fear of weight gain or sup-\nporting persistent behaviors that prevent it may be used to establish Criterion B.\nThe experience and significance of body weight and shape are distorted in these indi-\nviduals (Criterion C). Some individuals feel globally overweight. Others realize that they\nare thin but are still concerned that certain body parts, particularly the abdomen, buttocks,\nand thighs, are “too fat.” They may employ a variety of techniques to evaluate their body\nsize or weight, including frequent weighing, obsessive measuring of body parts, and per-\nsistent use of a mirror to check for perceived areas of “fat.” The self-esteem of individuals\nwith anorexia nervosa is highly dependent on their perceptions of body shape and weight.\nWeight loss is often viewed as an impressive achievement and a sign of extraordinary self-\ndiscipline, whereas weight gain is perceived as an unacceptable failure of self-control. Al-\nthough some individuals with this disorder may acknowledge being thin, they often do\nnot recognize the serious medical implications of their malnourished state.\nOften, the individual is brought to professional attention by family members after marked\nweight loss (or failure to make expected weight gains) has occurred. If individuals seek help\non their own, it is usually because of distress over the somatic and psychological sequelae\nof starvation. It is rare for an individual with anorexia nervosa to complain of weight loss\nper se. In fact, individuals with anorexia nervosa frequently either lack insight into or deny\nthe problem. It is therefore often important to obtain information from family members or\nother sources to evaluate the history of weight loss and other features of the illness.\nAnorexia Nervosa\n341There are three essential features of bulimia nervosa: recurrent episodes of binge eating\n(Criterion A), recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain\n(Criterion B), and self-evaluation that is unduly influenced by body shape and weight\n(Criterion D). To qualify for the diagnosis, the binge eating and inappropriate compensa-\ntory behaviors must occur, on average, at least once per week for 3 months (Criterion C).\nAn “episode of binge eating” is defined as eating, in a discrete period of time, an\namount of food that is definitely larger than most individuals would eat in a similar period\nof time under similar circumstances (Criterion A1). The context in which the eating occurs\n346\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\nmay affect the clinician’s estimation of whether the intake is excessive. For example, a\nquantity of food that might be regarded as excessive for a typical meal might be consid-\nered normal during a celebration or holiday meal. A “discrete period of time” refers to a\nlimited period, usually less than 2 hours. A single episode of binge eating need not be re-\nstricted to one setting. For example, an individual may begin a binge in a restaurant and\nthen continue to eat on returning home. Continual snacking on small amounts of food\nthroughout the day would not be considered an eating binge.\nAn occurrence of excessive food consumption must be accompanied by a sense of lack\nof control (Criterion A2) to be considered an episode of binge eating. An indicator of loss\nof control is the inability to refrain from eating or to stop eating once started. Some indi-\nviduals describe a dissociative quality during, or following, the binge-eating episodes. The\nimpairment in control associated with binge eating may not be absolute; for example, an\nindividual may continue binge eating while the telephone is ringing but will cease if a\nroommate or spouse unexpectedly enters the room. Some individuals report that their\nbinge-eating episodes are no longer characterized by an acute feeling of loss of control but\nrather by a more generalized pattern of uncontrolled eating. If individuals report that they\nhave abandoned efforts to control their eating, loss of control should be considered as\npresent. Binge eating can also be planned in some instances.\nThe type of food consumed during binges varies both across individuals and for a\ngiven individual. Binge eating appears to be characterized more by an abnormality in the\namount of food consumed than by a craving for a specific nutrient. However, during binges,\nindividuals tend to eat foods they would otherwise avoid.\nIndividuals with bulimia nervosa are typically ashamed of their eating problems and\nattempt to conceal their symptoms. Binge eating usually occurs in secrecy or as inconspic-\nuously as possible. The binge eating often continues until the individual is uncomfortably,\nor even painfully, full. The most common antecedent of binge eating is negative affect.\nOther triggers include interpersonal stressors; dietary restraint; negative feelings related\nto body weight, body shape, and food; and boredom. Binge eating may minimize or mit-\nigate factors that precipitated the episode in the short-term, but negative self-evaluation\nand dysphoria often are the delayed consequences.\nAnother essential feature of bulimia nervosa is the recurrent use of inappropriate com-\npensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain, collectively referred to as purge behaviors or\npurging (Criterion B). Many individuals with bulimia nervosa employ several methods to\ncompensate for binge eating. Vomiting is the most common inappropriate compensatory\nbehavior. The immediate effects of vomiting include relief from physical discomfort and re-\nduction of fear of gaining weight. In some cases, vomiting becomes a goal in itself, and the\nindividual will binge eat in order to vomit or will vomit after eating a small amount of food.\nIndividuals with bulimia nervosa may use a variety of methods to induce vomiting, includ-\ning the use of fingers or instruments to stimulate the gag reflex. Individuals generally\nbecome adept at inducing vomiting and are eventually able to vomit at will. Rarely, indi-\nviduals consume syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting. Other purging behaviors include the\nmisuse of laxatives and diuretics. A number of other compensatory methods may also be\nused in rare cases. Individuals with bulimia nervosa may misuse enemas following epi-\nsodes of binge eating, but this is seldom the sole compensatory method employed. Individ-\nuals with this disorder may take thyroid hormone in an attempt to avoid weight gain.\nIndividuals with diabetes mellitus and bulimia nervosa may omit or reduce insulin doses in\norder to reduce the metabolism of food consumed during eating binges. Individuals with\nbulimia nervosa may fast for a day or more or exercise excessively in an attempt to prevent\nweight gain. Exercise may be considered excessive when it significantly interferes with im-\nportant activities, when it occurs at inappropriate times or in inappropriate settings, or\nwhen the individual continues to exercise despite injury or other medical complications.\nIndividuals with bulimia nervosa place an excessive emphasis on body shape or weight\nin their self-evaluation, and these factors are typically extremely important in determining\nBulimia Nervosa\n347\nself-esteem (Criterion D). Individuals with this disorder may closely resemble those with\nanorexia nervosa in their fear of gaining weight, in their desire to lose weight, and in the\nlevel of dissatisfaction with their bodies. However, a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa should\nnot be given when the disturbance occurs only during episodes of anorexia nervosa (Cri-\nterion E).The essential feature of binge-eating disorder is recurrent episodes of binge eating that\nmust occur, on average, at least once per week for 3 months (Criterion D). An “episode of\nbinge eating” is defined as eating, in a discrete period of time, an amount of food that is defi-\nBinge-Eating Disorder\n351\nnitely larger than most people would eat in a similar period of time under similar circum-\nstances (Criterion A1). The context in which the eating occurs may affect the clinician’s\nestimation of whether the intake is excessive. For example, a quantity of food that might be\nregarded as excessive for a typical meal might be considered normal during a celebration\nor holiday meal. A “discrete period of time” refers to a limited period, usually less than\n2 hours. A single episode of binge eating need not be restricted to one setting. For example,\nan individual may begin a binge in a restaurant and then continue to eat on returning\nhome. Continual snacking on small amounts of food throughout the day would not be con-\nsidered an eating binge.\nAn occurrence of excessive food consumption must be accompanied by a sense of lack\nof control (Criterion A2) to be considered an episode of binge eating. An indicator of loss\nof control is the inability to refrain from eating or to stop eating once started. Some indi-\nviduals describe a dissociative quality during, or following, the binge-eating episodes. The\nimpairment in control associated with binge eating may not be absolute; for example, an\nindividual may continue binge eating while the telephone is ringing but will cease if a\nroommate or spouse unexpectedly enters the room. Some individuals report that their\nbinge-eating episodes are no longer characterized by an acute feeling of loss of control but\nrather by a more generalized pattern of uncontrolled eating. If individuals report that they\nhave abandoned efforts to control their eating, loss of control may still be considered as\npresent. Binge eating can also be planned in some instances.\nThe type of food consumed during binges varies both across individuals and for a given\nindividual. Binge eating appears to be characterized more by an abnormality in the amount\nof food consumed than by a craving for a specific nutrient.\nBinge eating must be characterized by marked distress (Criterion C) and at least three\nof the following features: eating much more rapidly than normal; eating until feeling un-\ncomfortably full; eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry; eating\nalone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is eating; and feeling disgusted\nwith oneself, depressed, or very guilty afterward (Criterion B).\nIndividuals with binge-eating disorder are typically ashamed of their eating problems\nand attempt to conceal their symptoms. Binge eating usually occurs in secrecy or as incon-\nspicuously as possible. The most common antecedent of binge eating is negative affect.\nOther triggers include interpersonal stressors; dietary restraint; negative feelings related\nto body weight, body shape, and food; and boredom. Binge eating may minimize or mit-\nigate factors that precipitated the episode in the short-term, but negative self-evaluation\nand dysphoria often are the delayed consequences.The essential feature of enuresis is repeated voiding of urine during the day or at night into\nbed or clothes (Criterion A). Most often the voiding is involuntary, but occasionally it may\n356\nElimination Disorders\nbe intentional. To qualify for a diagnosis of enuresis, the voiding of urine must occur at\nleast twice a week for at least 3 consecutive months or must cause clinically significant dis-\ntress or impairment in social, academic (occupational), or other important areas of func-\ntioning (Criterion B). The individual must have reached an age at which continence is\nexpected (i.e., a chronological age of at least 5 years or, for children with developmental\ndelays, a mental age of at least 5 years) (Criterion C). The urinary incontinence is not at-\ntributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a diuretic, an antipsychotic med-\nication) or another medical condition (e.g., diabetes, spina bifida, a seizure disorder)\n(Criterion D).The essential feature of encopresis is repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places (e.g.,\nclothing or floor) (Criterion A). Most often the passage is involuntary but occasionally may be\nintentional. The event must occur at least once a month for at least 3 months (Criterion B), and\nthe chronological age of the child must be at least 4 years (or for children with developmental\ndelays, the mental age must be at least 4 years) (Criterion C). The fecal incontinence must not\nbe exclusively attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., laxatives) or another\nmedical condition except through a mechanism involving constipation (Criterion D).\nWhen the passage of feces is involuntary rather than intentional, it is often related to\nconstipation, impaction, and retention with subsequent overflow. The constipation may\ndevelop for psychological reasons (e.g., anxiety about defecating in a particular place, a\nmore general pattern of anxious or oppositional behavior), leading to avoidance of defeca-\ntion. Physiological predispositions to constipation include ineffectual straining or paradox-\nical defecation dynamics, with contraction rather than relaxation of the external sphincter\nor pelvic floor during straining for defecation. Dehydration associated with a febrile ill-\nness, hypothyroidism, or a medication side effect can also induce constipation. Once con-\nstipation has developed, it may be complicated by an anal fissure, painful defecation, and\nfurther fecal retention. The consistency of the stool may vary. In some individuals the stool\nmay be of normal or near-normal consistency. In other individuals—such as those with\noverflow incontinence secondary to fecal retention—it may be liquid.The essential feature of insomnia disorder is dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality\nwith complaints of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep. The sleep complaints are ac-\ncompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other\nimportant areas of functioning. The sleep disturbance may occur during the course of an-\nother mental disorder or medical condition, or it may occur independently.\nDifferent manifestations of insomnia can occur at different times of the sleep period. Sleep-\nonset insomnia (or initial insomnia) involves difficulty initiating sleep at bedtime. Sleep mainte-\nnance insomnia (or middle insomnia) involves frequent or prolonged awakenings throughout\nthe night. Late insomnia involves early-morning awakening with an inability to return to sleep.\nDifficulty maintaining sleep is the most common single symptom of insomnia, followed by\ndifficulty falling asleep, while a combination of these symptoms is the most common presen-\ntation overall. The specific type of sleep complaint often varies over time. Individuals who\ncomplain of difficulty falling asleep at one time may later complain of difficulty maintaining\nsleep, and vice versa. Symptoms of difficulty falling asleep and difficulty maintaining sleep\ncan be quantified by the individual’s retrospective self-report, sleep diaries, or other methods,\nsuch as actigraphy or polysomnography, but the diagnosis of insomnia disorder is based on\nthe individual’s subjective perception of sleep or a caretaker’s report.\nNonrestorative sleep, a complaint of poor sleep quality that does not leave the individual\nrested upon awakening despite adequate duration, is a common sleep complaint usually\noccurring in association with difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or less frequently in\nisolation. This complaint can also be reported in association with other sleep disorders\n(e.g., breathing-related sleep disorder). When a complaint of nonrestorative sleep occurs\nin isolation (i.e., in the absence of difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep) but all di-\nagnostic criteria with regard to frequency, duration, and daytime distress and impairments\nare otherwise met, a diagnosis of other specified insomnia disorder or unspecified insom-\nnia disorder is made.\n364\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nAside from the frequency and duration criteria required to make the diagnosis, addi-\ntional criteria are useful to quantify insomnia severity. These quantitative criteria, while\narbitrary, are provided for illustrative purpose only. For instance, difficulty initiating sleep\nis defined by a subjective sleep latency greater than 20–30 minutes, and difficulty maintain-\ning sleep is defined by a subjective time awake after sleep onset greater than 20–30 min-\nutes. Although there is no standard definition of early-morning awakening, this symptom\ninvolves awakening at least 30 minutes before the scheduled time and before total sleep\ntime reaches 6½ hours. It is essential to take into account not only the final awakening time\nbut also the bedtime on the previous evening. Awakening at 4:00 A.M. does not have the\nsame clinical significance in those who go to bed at 9:00 P.M. as in those who go to bed at\n11:00 P.M. Such a symptom may also reflect an age-dependent decrease in the ability to sus-\ntain sleep or an age-dependent shift in the timing of the main sleep period.\nInsomnia disorder involves daytime impairments as well as nighttime sleep difficulties.\nThese include fatigue or, less commonly, daytime sleepiness; the latter is more common\namong older individuals and when insomnia is comorbid with another medical condition\n(e.g., chronic pain) or sleep disorder (e.g., sleep apnea). Impairment in cognitive performance\nmay include difficulties with attention, concentration and memory, and even with performing\nsimple manual skills. Associated mood disturbances are typically described as irritability or\nmood lability and less commonly as depressive or anxiety symptoms. Not all individuals with\nnighttime sleep disturbances are distressed or have functional impairment. For example, sleep\ncontinuity is often interrupted in healthy older adults who nevertheless identify themselves\nas good sleepers. A diagnosis of insomnia disorder should be reserved for those individuals\nwith significant daytime distress or impairment related to their nighttime sleep difficulties.Hypersomnolence is a broad diagnostic term and includes symptoms of excessive quantity\nof sleep (e.g., extended nocturnal sleep or involuntary daytime sleep), deteriorated quality\nof wakefulness (i.e., sleep propensity during wakefulness as shown by difficulty awaken-\ning or inability to remain awake when required), and sleep inertia (i.e., a period of im-\npaired performance and reduced vigilance following awakening from the regular sleep\nepisode or from a nap) (Criterion A). Individuals with this disorder fall asleep quickly and\nhave a good sleep efficiency (>90%). They may have difficulty waking up in the morning,\nsometimes appearing confused, combative, or ataxic. This prolonged impairment of alert-\nness at the sleep-wake transition is often referred to as sleep inertia (i.e., sleep drunkenness).\nIt can also occur upon awakening from a daytime nap. During that period, the individual\nappears awake, but there is a decline in motor dexterity, behavior may be very inappro-\npriate, and memory deficits, disorientation in time and space, and feelings of grogginess\nmay occur. This period may last some minutes to hours.\nThe persistent need for sleep can lead to automatic behavior (usually of a very routine,\nlow-complexity type) that the individual carries out with little or no subsequent recall. For\nexample, individuals may find themselves having driven several miles from where they\nthought they were, unaware of the “automatic” driving they did in the preceding minutes.\nFor some individuals with hypersomnolence disorder, the major sleep episode (for most\nindividuals, nocturnal sleep) has a duration of 9 hours or more. However, the sleep is often\nnonrestorative and is followed by difficulty awakening in the morning. For other individ-\nuals with hypersomnolence disorder, the major sleep episode is of normal nocturnal sleep\nduration (6–9 hours). In these cases, the excessive sleepiness is characterized by several un-\nintentional daytime naps. These daytime naps tend to be relatively long (often lasting 1 hour\nor more), are experienced as nonrestorative (i.e., unrefreshing), and do not lead to improved\nalertness. Individuals with hypersomnolence have daytime naps nearly everyday regard-\nless of the nocturnal sleep duration. Subjective sleep quality may or may not be reported as\ngood. Individuals typically feel sleepiness developing over a period of time, rather than\n370\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nexperiencing a sudden sleep “attack.” Unintentional sleep episodes typically occur in low-\nstimulation and low-activity situations (e.g., while attending lectures, reading, watching\ntelevision, or driving long distances), but in more severe cases they can manifest in high-\nattention situations such as at work, in meetings, or at social gatherings.The essential features of sleepiness in narcolepsy are recurrent daytime naps or lapses into\nsleep. Sleepiness typically occurs daily but must occur at a minimum three times a week\nfor at least 3 months (Criterion A). Narcolepsy generally produces cataplexy, which most\ncommonly presents as brief episodes (seconds to minutes) of sudden, bilateral loss of mus-\ncle tone precipitated by emotions, typically laughing and joking. Muscles affected may\ninclude those of the neck, jaw, arms, legs, or whole body, resulting in head bobbing, jaw\ndropping, or complete falls. Individuals are awake and aware during cataplexy. To meet\nCriterion B1(a), cataplexy must be triggered by laughter or joking and must occur at least\na few times per month when the condition is untreated or in the past.\nCataplexy should not be confused with “weakness” occurring in the context of athletic\nactivities (physiological) or exclusively after unusual emotional triggers such as stress or\nanxiety (suggesting possible psychopathology). Episodes lasting hours or days, or those not\ntriggered by emotions, are unlikely to be cataplexy, nor is rolling on the floor while laugh-\ning hysterically.\nIn children close to onset, genuine cataplexy can be atypical, affecting primarily the\nface, causing grimaces or jaw opening with tongue thrusting (“cataplectic faces”). Alter-\nnatively, cataplexy may present as low-grade continuous hypotonia, yielding a wobbling\nwalk. In these cases, Criterion B1(b) can be met in children or in individuals within 6 months\nof a rapid onset.\nNarcolepsy-cataplexy nearly always results from the loss of hypothalamic hypocretin\n(orexin)–producing cells, causing hypocretin deficiency (less than or equal to one-third of\ncontrol values, or 110 pg/mL in most laboratories). Cell loss is likely autoimmune, and ap-\nproximately 99% of affected individuals carry HLA-DQB1*06:02 (vs. 12%–38% of control\nsubjects). Thus, checking for the presence of DQB1*06:02 prior to a lumbar puncture for eval-\nuation of CSF hypocretin-1 immunoreactivity may be useful. Rarely, low CSF levels of hypo-\ncretin-1 occur without cataplexy, notably in youths who may develop cataplexy later. CSF\nhypocretin-1 measurement represents the gold standard, excepting associated severe con-\nditions (neurological, inflammatory, infectious, trauma) that can interfere with the assay.\nA nocturnal polysomnographic sleep study followed by an MSLT can also be used to\nconfirm the diagnosis (Criterion B3). These tests must be performed after the individual\nhas stopped all psychotropic medications, following 2 weeks of adequate sleep time (as\ndocumented with sleep diaries, actigraphy). Short rapid eye movement (REM) latency\n(sleep-onset REM period, REM latency less than or equal to 15 minutes) during polysom-\nnography is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis and meets Criterion B3. Alternatively, the\nMSLT result must be positive, showing a mean sleep latency of less than or equal to 8 min-\nutes and two or more sleep-onset REM periods in four to five naps.Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is the most common breathing-related sleep disorder.\nIt is characterized by repeated episodes of upper (pharyngeal) airway obstruction (apneas\nand hypopneas) during sleep. Apnea refers to the total absence of airflow, and hypopnea re-\nfers to a reduction in airflow. Each apnea or hypopnea represents a reduction in breathing\nof at least 10 seconds in duration in adults or two missed breaths in children and is typi-\ncally associated with drops in oxygen saturation of 3% or greater and/or an electroenceph-\nalographic arousal. Both sleep-related (nocturnal) and wake-time symptoms are common.\nThe cardinal symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea are snoring and daytime\nsleepiness.\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea in adults is diagnosed on the basis of polysom-\nnographic findings and symptoms. The diagnosis is based on symptoms of 1) nocturnal\nbreathing disturbances (i.e., snoring, snorting/gasping, breathing pauses during sleep), or\n2) daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or unrefreshing sleep despite sufficient opportunities to\nsleep that are not better explained by another mental disorder and not attributable to an-\nother medical condition, along with 3) evidence by polysomnography of five or more ob-\nstructive apneas or hypopneas per hour of sleep (Criterion A1). Diagnosis can be made in\nthe absence of these symptoms if there is evidence by polysomnography of 15 or more ob-\nstructive apneas and/or hypopneas per hour of sleep (Criterion A2).\nSpecific attention to disturbed sleep occurring in association with snoring or breathing\npauses and physical findings that increase risk of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea (e.g.,\ncentral obesity, crowded pharyngeal airway, elevated blood pressure) is needed to reduce\nthe chance of misdiagnosing this treatable condition.Central sleep apnea disorders are characterized by repeated episodes of apneas and hy-\npopneas during sleep caused by variability in respiratory effort. These are disorders of\nventilatory control in which respiratory events occur in a periodic or intermittent pattern.\nIdiopathic central sleep apnea is characterized by sleepiness, insomnia, and awakenings due\nto dyspnea in association with five or more central apneas per hour of sleep. Central sleep\napnea occurring in individuals with heart failure, stroke, or renal failure typically have a\nbreathing pattern called Cheyne-Stokes breathing, which is characterized by a pattern of\nperiodic crescendo-decrescendo variation in tidal volume that results in central apneas\nand hypopneas occurring at a frequency of at least five events per hour that are accompa-\nnied by frequent arousals. Central and obstructive sleep apneas may coexist; the ratio of\ncentral to obstructive apneas/hypopneas may be used to identify which condition is pre-\ndominant.\nAlterations in neuromuscular control of breathing can occur in association with med-\nications or substances used in individuals with mental health conditions, which can cause\nor exacerbate impairments of respiratory rhythm and ventilation. Individuals taking these\nmedications have a sleep-related breathing disorder that could contribute to sleep distur-\nbances and symptoms such as sleepiness, confusion, and depression. Specifically, chronic\nCentral Sleep Apnea\n385\nuse of long-acting opioid medications is often associated with impairment of respiratory con-\ntrol leading to central sleep apnea.Sleep-related hypoventilation can occur independently or, more frequently, comorbid\nwith medical or neurological disorders, medication use, or substance use disorder. Al-\nthough symptoms are not mandatory to make this diagnosis, individuals often report\nexcessive daytime sleepiness, frequent arousals and awakenings during sleep, morning\nheadaches, and insomnia complaints.The delayed sleep phase type is based primarily on a history of a delay in the timing of the\nmajor sleep period (usually more than 2 hours) in relation to the desired sleep and wake-\nup time, resulting in symptoms of insomnia and excessive sleepiness. When allowed to set\ntheir own schedule, individuals with delayed sleep phase type exhibit normal sleep qual-\nity and duration for age. Symptoms of sleep-onset insomnia, difficulty waking in the\nmorning, and excessive early day sleepiness are prominent.Advanced sleep phase type is characterized by sleep-wake times that are several hours\nearlier than desired or conventional times. Diagnosis is based primarily on a history of an\nadvance in the timing of the major sleep period (usually more than 2 hours) in relation to\nthe desired sleep and wake-up time, with symptoms of early morning insomnia and ex-\ncessive daytime sleepiness. When allowed to set their schedule, individuals with ad-\nvanced sleep phase type will exhibit normal sleep quality and duration for age.The diagnosis of irregular sleep-wake type is based primarily on a history of symptoms of\ninsomnia at night (during the usual sleep period) and excessive sleepiness (napping) dur-\ning the day. Irregular sleep-wake type is characterized by a lack of discernable sleep-wake\nCircadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders\n395\ncircadian rhythm. There is no major sleep period, and sleep is fragmented into at least\nthree periods during the 24-hour day.The diagnosis of non-24-hour sleep-wake type is based primarily on a history of symp-\ntoms of insomnia or excessive sleepiness related to abnormal synchronization between the\n24-hour light-dark cycle and the endogenous circadian rhythm. Individuals typically pre-\nsent with periods of insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or both, which alternate with short\nasymptomatic periods. Starting with the asymptomatic period, when the individual’s\nsleep phase is aligned to the external environment, sleep latency will gradually increase\nand the individual will complain of sleep-onset insomnia. As the sleep phase continues to\ndrift so that sleep time is now in the daytime, the individual will have trouble staying\nawake during the day and will complain of sleepiness. Because the circadian period is not\naligned to the external 24-hour environment, symptoms will depend on when an individ-\nual tries to sleep in relation to the circadian rhythm of sleep propensity.Diagnosis is primarily based on a history of the individual working outside of the normal\n8:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. daytime window (particularly at night) on a regularly scheduled (i.e.,\nnon-overtime) basis. Symptoms of excessive sleepiness at work, and impaired sleep at\nhome, on a persistent basis are prominent. Presence of both sets of symptoms are usually\nrequired for a diagnosis of shift work type. Typically, when the individual reverts to a day-\nwork routine, symptoms resolve. Although the etiology is slightly different, individuals\nwho travel across many time zones on a very frequent basis may experience effects similar\nto those experienced by individuals with shift work type who work rotating shifts.The essential feature of non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep arousal disorders is the\nrepeated occurrence of incomplete arousals, usually beginning during the first third of the\nmajor sleep episode (Criterion A), that typically are brief, lasting 1–10 minutes, but may be\nprotracted, lasting up to 1 hour. The maximum duration of an event is unknown. The eyes\nare typically open during these events. Many individuals exhibit both subtypes of arousals\non different occasions, which underscores the unitary underlying pathophysiology. TheNightmares are typically lengthy, elaborate, storylike sequences of dream imagery that\nseem real and that incite anxiety, fear, or other dysphoric emotions. Nightmare content\ntypically focuses on attempts to avoid or cope with imminent danger but may involve\nthemes that evoke other negative emotions. Nightmares occurring after traumatic experi-\nences may replicate the threatening situation (“replicative nightmares”), but most do not.\nOn awakening, nightmares are well remembered and can be described in detail. They arise\nNightmare Disorder\n405\nalmost exclusively during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and can thus occur through-\nout sleep but are more likely in the second half of the major sleep episode when dreaming\nis longer and more intense. Factors that increase early-night REM intensity, such as sleep\nfragmentation or deprivation, jet lag, and REM-sensitive medications, might facilitate\nnightmares earlier in the night, including at sleep onset.\nNightmares usually terminate with awakening and rapid return of full alertness. How-\never, the dysphoric emotions may persist into wakefulness and contribute to difficulty re-\nturning to sleep and lasting daytime distress. Some nightmares, known as “bad dreams,”\nmay not induce awakening and are recalled only later. If nightmares occur during sleep-\nonset REM periods (hypnagogic), the dysphoric emotion is frequently accompanied by a\nsense of being both awake and unable to move voluntarily (isolated sleep paralysis).The essential feature of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder is repeated\nepisodes of arousal, often associated with vocalizations and/or complex motor behaviors\narising from REM sleep (Criterion A). These behaviors often reflect motor responses to the\ncontent of action-filled or violent dreams of being attacked or trying to escape from a\nthreatening situation, which may be termed dream enacting behaviors. The vocalizations are\noften loud, emotion-filled, and profane. These behaviors may be very bothersome to the\nindividual and the bed partner and may result in significant injury (e.g., falling, jumping,\nor flying out of bed; running, punching, thrusting, hitting, or kicking). Upon awakening,\nthe individual is immediately awake, alert, and oriented (Criterion C) and is often able to\nrecall dream mentation, which closely correlates with the observed behavior. The eyes\ntypically remain closed during these events. The diagnosis of REM sleep behavior disor-\nder requires clinically significant distress or impairment (Criterion E); this determination\nwill depend on a number of factors, including the frequency of events, the potential for vi-\nolence or injurious behaviors, embarrassment, and distress in other household members.Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor, neurological sleep disorder characterized\nby a desire to move the legs or arms, usually associated with uncomfortable sensations\ntypically described as creeping, crawling, tingling, burning, or itching (Criterion A). The\ndiagnosis of RLS is based primarily on patient self-report and history. Symptoms are\nworse when the individual is at rest, and frequent movements of the legs occur in an effort\nto relieve the uncomfortable sensations. Symptoms are worse in the evening or night, and\nin some individuals they occur only in the evening or night. Evening worsening occurs in-\ndependently of any differences in activity. It is important to differentiate RLS from other\nconditions such as positional discomfort and leg cramps (Criterion D).\nThe symptoms of RLS can delay sleep onset and awaken the individual from sleep and\nare associated with significant sleep fragmentation. The relief obtained from moving the\nlegs may no longer be apparent in severe cases. RLS is associated with daytime sleepiness\nand is frequently accompanied by significant clinical distress or functional impairment.The essential feature of substance/medication-induced sleep disorder is a prominent sleep\ndisturbance that is sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention (Criterion A)\nand that is judged to be primarily associated with the pharmacological effects of a substance\n(i.e., a drug of abuse, a medication, toxin exposure) (Criterion B). Depending on the sub-\nstance involved, one of four types of sleep disturbances is reported. Insomnia type and day-\ntime sleepiness type are most common, while parasomnia type is seen less often. The mixed\ntype is noted when more than one type of sleep disturbance–related symptom is present and\nnone predominates. The disturbance must not be better explained by another sleep disorder\n(Criterion C). A substance/medication-induced sleep disorder is distinguished from insom-\nnia disorder or a disorder associated with excessive daytime sleepiness by considering onset\nand course. For drugs of abuse, there must be evidence of intoxication or withdrawal from\nthe history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. Substance/medication-induced\nsleep disorder arises only in association with intoxication or discontinuation/withdrawal\nstates, whereas other sleep disorders may precede the onset of substance use or occur during\ntimes of sustained abstinence. As discontinuation/withdrawal states for some substances\ncan be protracted, onset of the sleep disturbance can occur 4 weeks after cessation of sub-\nstance use, and the disturbance may have features atypical of other sleep disorders (e.g.,\natypical age at onset or course). The diagnosis is not made if the sleep disturbance occurs\nonly during a delirium (Criterion D). The symptoms must cause clinically significant dis-\ntress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Crite-\nrion E). This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or\nsubstance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical\npicture and when the symptoms warrant independent clinical attention.The distinguishing feature of delayed ejaculation is a marked delay in or inability to\nachieve ejaculation (Criterion A). The man reports difficulty or inability to ejaculate de-\nspite the presence of adequate sexual stimulation and the desire to ejaculate. The present-\ning complaint usually involves partnered sexual activity. In most cases, the diagnosis will\nbe made by self-report of the individual. The definition of “delay” does not have precise\nboundaries, as there is noconsensus as to what constitutes a reasonable time to reach or-\ngasm or what is unacceptably long for most men and their sexual partners.The essential feature of erectile disorder is the repeated failure to obtain or maintain erec-\ntions during partnered sexual activities (Criterion A). A careful sexual history is necessary\nto ascertain that the problem has been present for a significant duration of time (i.e., at least\napproximately 6 months) and occurs on the majority of sexual occasions (i.e., at least 75%\nof the time). Symptoms may occur only in specific situations involving certain types of\nstimulation or partners, or they may occur in a generalized manner in all types of situa-\ntions, stimulation, or partners.Female orgasmic disorder is characterized by difficulty experiencing orgasm and/or\nmarkedly reduced intensity of orgasmic sensations (Criterion A). Women show wide vari-\nability in the type or intensity of stimulation that elicits orgasm. Similarly, subjective descrip-\ntions of orgasm are extremely varied, suggesting that it is experienced in very different\nways, both across women and on different occasions by the same woman. For a diagnosis\nof female orgasmic disorder, symptoms must be experienced on almost all or all (approx-\nimately 75%–100%) occasions of sexual activity (in identified situational contexts or, if\ngeneralized, in all contexts) and have a minimum duration of approximately 6 months.\nThe use of the minimum severity and duration criteria is intended to distinguish transient\norgasm difficulties from more persistent orgasmic dysfunction. The inclusion of “approx-\nimately” in Criterion B allows for clinician judgment in cases in which symptom duration\ndoes not meet the recommended 6-month threshold.\nFor a woman to have a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder, clinically significant dis-\ntress must accompany the symptoms (Criterion C). In many cases of orgasm problems, the\ncauses are multifactorial or cannot be determined. If female orgasmic disorder is deemed\nto be better explained by another mental disorder, the effects of a substance/medication,\nor a medical condition, then a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would not be made.\nFinally, if interpersonal or significant contextual factors, such as severe relationship dis-\ntress, intimate partner violence, or other significant stressors, are present, then a diagnosis\nof female orgasmic disorder would not be made.\nMany women require clitoral stimulation to reach orgasm, and a relatively small pro-\nportion of women report that they always experience orgasm during penile-vaginal inter-\ncourse. Thus, a woman’s experiencing orgasm through clitoral stimulation but not during\nintercourse does not meet criteria for a clinical diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder. It is\nalso important to consider whether orgasmic difficulties are the result of inadequate sex-\nual stimulation; in these cases, there may still be a need for care, but a diagnosis of female\norgasmic disorder would not be made.In assessing female sexual interest/arousal disorder, interpersonal context must be taken\ninto account. A “desire discrepancy,” in which a woman has lower desire for sexual activ-\nity than her partner, is not sufficient to diagnose female sexual interest/arousal disorder.\nIn order for the criteria for the disorder to be met, there must be absence or reduced fre-\nquency or intensity of at least three of six indicators (Criterion A) for a minimum duration\nof approximately 6 months (Criterion B). There may be different symptom profiles across\nwomen, as well as variability in how sexual interest and arousal are expressed. For exam-\nple, in one woman, sexual interest/arousal disorder may be expressed as a lack of interest\nin sexual activity, an absence of erotic or sexual thoughts, and reluctance to initiate sexual\nactivity and respond to a partner’s sexual invitations. In another woman, an inability to be-\ncome sexually excited, to respond to sexual stimuli with sexual desire, and a correspond-\n434\nSexual Dysfunctions\ning lack of signs of physical sexual arousal may be the primary features. Because sexual\ndesire and arousal frequently coexist and are elicited in response to adequate sexual cues,\nthe criteria for female sexual interest/arousal disorder take into account that difficulties in\ndesire and arousal often simultaneously characterize the complaints of women with this\ndisorder. Short-term changes in sexual interest or arousal are common and may be adaptive\nresponses to events in a woman’s life and do not represent a sexual dysfunction. Diagnosis\nof female sexual interest/arousal disorder requires a minimum duration of symptoms of\napproximately 6 months as a reflection that the symptoms must be a persistent problem.\nThe estimation of persistence may be determined by clinical judgment when a duration of\n6 months cannot be ascertained precisely.\nThere may be absent or reduced frequency or intensity of interest in sexual activity (Crite-\nrion A1), which was previously termed hypoactive sexual desire disorder. The frequency or inten-\nsity of sexual and erotic thoughts or fantasies may be absent or reduced (Criterion A2). The\nexpression of fantasies varies widely across women and may include memories of past sexual\nexperiences. The normative decline in sexual thoughts with age should be taken into account\nwhen this criterion is being assessed. Absence or reduced frequency of initiating sexual activ-\nity and of receptivity to a partner’s sexual invitations (Criterion A3) is a behaviorally focused\ncriterion. A couple’s beliefs and preferences for sexual initiation patterns are highly relevant to\nthe assessment of this criterion. There may be absent or reduced sexual excitement or pleasure\nduring sexual activity in almost all or all (approximately 75%–100%) sexual encounters (Cri-\nterion A4). Lack of pleasure is a common presenting clinical complaint in women with low de-\nsire. Among women who report low sexual desire, there are fewer sexual or erotic cues that\nelicit sexual interest or arousal (i.e., there is a lack of “responsive desire”). Assessment of the\nadequacy of sexual stimuli will assist in determining if there is a difficulty with responsive sex-\nual desire (Criterion A5). Frequency or intensity of genital or nongenital sensations during sex-\nual activity may be reduced or absent (Criterion A6). This may include reduced vaginal\nlubrication/vasocongestion, but because physiological measures of genital sexual response do\nnot differentiate women who report sexual arousal concerns from those who do not, the self-\nreport of reduced or absent genital or nongenital sensations is sufficient.\nFor a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder to be made, clinically signif-\nicant distress must accompany the symptoms in Criterion A. Distress may be experienced\nas a result of the lack of sexual interest/arousal or as a result of significant interference in\na woman’s life and well-being. If a lifelong lack of sexual desire is better explained by one’s\nself-identification as “asexual,” then a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disor-\nder would not be made.Genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder refers to four commonly comorbid symptom di-\nmensions: 1) difficulty having intercourse, 2) genito-pelvic pain, 3) fear of pain or vaginal\npenetration, and 4) tension of the pelvic floor muscles (Criterion A). Because major diffi-\nculty in any one of these symptom dimensions is often sufficient to cause clinically sig-\nnificant distress, a diagnosis can be made on the basis of marked difficulty in only one\nsymptom dimension. However, all four symptom dimensions should be assessed even if a\ndiagnosis can be made on the basis of only one symptom dimension.\nMarked difficulty having vaginal intercourse/penetration (Criterion A1) can vary from a total in-\nability to experience vaginal penetration in any situation (e.g., intercourse, gynecological ex-\naminations, tampon insertion) to the ability to easily experience penetration in one situation\nand but not in another. Although the most common clinical situation is when a woman is un-\nable to experience intercourse or penetration with a partner, difficulties in undergoing re-\nquired gynecological examinations may also be present. Marked vulvovaginal or pelvic pain\nduring vaginal intercourse or penetration attempts (Criterion A2) refers to pain occurring in differ-\nent locations in the genito-pelvic area. Location of pain as well as intensity should be assessed.\nTypically, pain can be characterized as superficial (vulvovaginal or occurring during penetra-\ntion) or deep (pelvic; i.e., not felt until deeper penetration). The intensity of the pain is often not\nlinearly related to distress or interference with sexual intercourse or other sexual activities.\nSome genito-pelvic pain only occurs when provoked (i.e., by intercourse or mechanical stim-\n438\nSexual Dysfunctions\nulation); other genito-pelvic pain may be spontaneous as well as provoked. Genito-pelvic pain\ncan also be usefully characterized qualitatively (e.g., “burning,” “cutting,” “shooting,” “throb-\nbing”). The pain may persist for a period after intercourse is completed and may also occur\nduring urination. Typically, the pain experienced during sexual intercourse can be reproduced\nduring a gynecological examination.\nMarked fear or anxiety about vulvovaginal or pelvic pain either in anticipation of, or during, or\nas a result of vaginal penetration (Criterion A3) is commonly reported by women who have\nregularly experienced pain during sexual intercourse. This “normal” reaction may lead to\navoidance of sexual/intimate situations. In other cases, this marked fear does not appear\nto be closely related to the experience of pain but nonetheless leads to avoidance of inter-\ncourse and vaginal penetration situations. Some have described this as similar to a phobic\nreaction except that the phobic object may be vaginal penetration or the fear of pain.\nMarked tensing or tightening of the pelvic floor muscles during attempted vaginal penetration\n(Criterion A4) can vary from reflexive-like spasm of the pelvic floor in response to at-\ntempted vaginal entry to “normal/voluntary” muscle guarding in response to the antici-\npated or the repeated experience of pain or to fear or anxiety. In the case of “normal/\nguarding” reactions, penetration may be possible under circumstances of relaxation. The\ncharacterization and assessment of pelvic floor dysfunction is often best undertaken by a\nspecialist gynecologist or by a pelvic floor physical therapist.When an assessment for male hypoactive sexual desire disorder is being made, inter-\npersonal context must be taken into account. A “desire discrepancy,” in which a man has\nlower desire for sexual activity than his partner, is not sufficient to diagnose male hypo-\nactive sexual desire disorder. Both low/absent desire for sex and deficient/absent sexual\nthoughts or fantasies are required for a diagnosis of the disorder. There may be variation\nacross men in how sexual desire is expressed.\nThe lack of desire for sex and deficient/absent erotic thoughts or fantasies must be per-\nsistent or recurrent and must occur for a minimum duration of approximately 6 months.\nThe inclusion of this duration criterion is meant to safeguard against making a diagnosis in\ncases in which a man’s low sexual desire may represent an adaptive response to adverse\nlife conditions (e.g., concern about a partner’s pregnancy when the man is considering ter-\nminating the relationship). The introduction of “approximately” in Criterion B allows for\nclinician judgment in cases in which symptom duration does not meet the recommended\n6-month threshold.Premature (early) ejaculation is manifested by ejaculation that occurs prior to or shortly af-\nter vaginal penetration, operationalized by an individual’s estimate of ejaculatory latency\n(i.e., elapsed time before ejaculation) after vaginal penetration. Estimated and measured\nintravaginal ejaculatory latencies are highly correlated as long as the ejaculatory latency is\nof short duration; therefore, self-reported estimates of ejaculatory latency are sufficient for\ndiagnostic purposes. A 60-second intravaginal ejaculatory latency time is an appropriate\ncutoff for the diagnosis of lifelong premature (early) ejaculation in heterosexual men.\nThere are insufficient data to determine if this duration criterion can be applied to ac-\nquired premature (early) ejaculation. The durational definition may apply to males of\nvarying sexual orientations, since ejaculatory latencies appear to be similar across men of\ndifferent sexual orientations and across different sexual activities.The major feature is a disturbance in sexual function that has a temporal relationship with\nsubstance/medication initiation, dose increase, or substance/medication discontinuation.Individuals with gender dysphoria have a marked incongruence between the gender they\nhave been assigned to (usually at birth, referred to as natal gender) and their experienced/\nexpressed gender. This discrepancy is the core component of the diagnosis. There must\nalso be evidence of distress about this incongruence. Experienced gender may include al-\nternative gender identities beyond binary stereotypes. Consequently, the distress is not\nlimited to a desire to simply be of the other gender, but may include a desire to be of an al-\nternative gender, provided that it differs from the individual’s assigned gender.\nGender dysphoria manifests itself differently in different age groups. Prepubertal natal\ngirls with gender dysphoria may express the wish to be a boy, assert they are a boy, or as-\nsert they will grow up to be a man. They prefer boys’ clothing and hairstyles, are often\nperceived by strangers as boys, and may ask to be called by a boy’s name. Usually, they dis-\nplay intense negative reactions to parental attempts to have them wear dresses or other\nfeminine attire. Some may refuse to attend school or social events where such clothes are\nrequired. These girls may demonstrate marked cross-gender identification in role-playing,\ndreams, and fantasies. Contact sports, rough-and-tumble play, traditional boyhood games,\nand boys as playmates are most often preferred. They show little interest in stereotypically\nfeminine toys (e.g., dolls) or activities (e.g., feminine dress-up or role-play). Occasionally,\nthey refuse to urinate in a sitting position. Some natal girls may express a desire to have a\npenis or claim to have a penis or that they will grow one when older. They may also state that\nthey do not want to develop breasts or menstruate.\nPrepubertal natal boys with gender dysphoria may express the wish to be a girl or as-\nsert they are a girl or that they will grow up to be a woman. They have a preference for\ndressing in girls’ or women’s clothes or may improvise clothing from available materials\n(e.g., using towels, aprons, and scarves for long hair or skirts). These children may role-\nplay female figures (e.g., playing “mother”) and often are intensely interested in female\nfantasy figures. Traditional feminine activities, stereotypical games, and pastimes (e.g.,\n“playing house”; drawing feminine pictures; watching television or videos of favorite fe-\nmale characters) are most often preferred. Stereotypical female-type dolls (e.g., Barbie) are\noften favorite toys, and girls are their preferred playmates. They avoid rough-and-tumble\nplay and competitive sports and have little interest in stereotypically masculine toys (e.g.,\ncars, trucks). Some may pretend not to have a penis and insist on sitting to urinate. More\n454\nGender Dysphoria\nrarely, they may state that they find their penis or testes disgusting, that they wish them re-\nmoved, or that they have, or wish to have, a vagina.\nIn young adolescents with gender dysphoria, clinical features may resemble those of\nchildren or adults with the condition, depending on developmental level. As secondary\nsex characteristics of young adolescents are not yet fully developed, these individuals may\nnot state dislike of them, but they are concerned about imminent physical changes.\nIn adults with gender dysphoria, the discrepancy between experienced gender and\nphysical sex characteristics is often, but not always, accompanied by a desire to be rid of\nprimary and/or secondary sex characteristics and/or a strong desire to acquire some pri-\nmary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender. To varying degrees, adults\nwith gender dysphoria may adopt the behavior, clothing, and mannerisms of the experi-\nenced gender. They feel uncomfortable being regarded by others, or functioning in soci-\nety, as members of their assigned gender. Some adults may have a strong desire to be of a\ndifferent gender and treated as such, and they may have an inner certainty to feel and re-\nspond as the experienced gender without seeking medical treatment to alter body char-\nacteristics. They may find other ways to resolve the incongruence between experienced/\nexpressed and assigned gender by partially living in the desired role or by adopting a gen-\nder role neither conventionally male nor conventionally female.The essential feature of oppositional defiant disorder is a frequent and persistent pattern\nof angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness (Criterion\nA). It is not unusual for individuals with oppositional defiant disorder to show the behav-\nioral features of the disorder without problems of negative mood. However, individuals\nwith the disorder who show the angry/irritable mood symptoms typically show the be-\nhavioral features as well.\nThe symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder may be confined to only one setting,\nand this is most frequently the home. Individuals who show enough symptoms to meet\nthe diagnostic threshold, even if it is only at home, may be significantly impaired in their\nsocial functioning. However, in more severe cases, the symptoms of the disorder are pres-\nent in multiple settings. Given that the pervasiveness of symptoms is an indicator of the\nseverity of the disorder, it is critical that the individual’s behavior be assessed across mul-\ntiple settings and relationships. Because these behaviors are common among siblings, they\nmust be observed during interactions with persons other than siblings. Also, because\nsymptoms of the disorder are typically more evident in interactions with adults or peers\nwhom the individual knows well, they may not be apparent during a clinical examination.\nThe symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder can occur to some degree in individu-\nals without this disorder. There are several key considerations for determining if the be-\nhaviors are symptomatic of oppositional defiant disorder. First, the diagnostic threshold\nof four or more symptoms within the preceding 6 months must be met. Second, the per-\nsistence and frequency of the symptoms should exceed what is normative for an individ-\nual’s age, gender, and culture. For example, it is not unusual for preschool children to\nshow temper tantrums on a weekly basis. Temper outbursts for a preschool child would be\nconsidered a symptom of oppositional defiant disorder only if they occurred on most days\nfor the preceding 6 months, if they occurred with at least three other symptoms of the dis-\norder, and if the temper outbursts contributed to the significant impairment associated\nwith the disorder (e.g., led to destruction of property during outbursts, resulted in the\nchild being asked to leave a preschool).\nThe symptoms of the disorder often are part of a pattern of problematic interactions\nwith others. Furthermore, individuals with this disorder typically do not regard themselves\nas angry, oppositional, or defiant. Instead, they often justify their behavior as a response to\nunreasonable demands or circumstances. Thus, it can be difficult to disentangle the rela-\ntive contribution of the individual with the disorder to the problematic interactions he or\nshe experiences. For example, children with oppositional defiant disorder may have ex-\nperienced a history of hostile parenting, and it is often impossible to determine if the\nchild’s behavior caused the parents to act in a more hostile manner toward the child, if the\nparents’ hostility led to the child’s problematic behavior, or if there was some combination\nof both. Whether or not the clinician can separate the relative contributions of potential\ncausal factors should not influence whether or not the diagnosis is made. In the event that\nthe child may be living in particularly poor conditions where neglect or mistreatment may\noccur (e.g., in institutional settings), clinical attention to reducing the contribution of the\nenvironment may be helpful.\n464\nDisruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct DisordersThe impulsive (or anger-based) aggressive outbursts in intermittent explosive disorder have\na rapid onset and, typically, little or no prodromal period. Outbursts typically last for less\nIntermittent Explosive Disorder\n467\nthan 30 minutes and commonly occur in response to a minor provocation by a close intimate\nor associate. Individuals with intermittent explosive disorder often have less severe epi-\nsodes of verbal and/or nondamaging, nondestructive, or noninjurious physical assault (Cri-\nterion A1) in between more severe destructive/assaultive episodes (Criterion A2). Criterion\nA1 defines frequent (i.e., twice weekly, on average, for a period of 3 months) aggressive out-\nbursts characterized by temper tantrums, tirades, verbal arguments or fights, or assault\nwithout damage to objects or without injury to animals or other individuals. Criterion A2\ndefines infrequent (i.e., three in a 1-year period) impulsive aggressive outbursts character-\nized by damaging or destroying an object, regardless of its tangible value, or by assaulting/\nstriking or otherwise causing physical injury to an animal or to another individual. Regard-\nless of the nature of the impulsive aggressive outburst, the core feature of intermittent\nexplosive disorder is failure to control impulsive aggressive behavior in response to subjec-\ntively experienced provocation (i.e., psychosocial stressor) that would not typically result in\nan aggressive outburst (Criterion B). The aggressive outbursts are generally impulsive and/\nor anger-based, rather than premeditated or instrumental (Criterion C) and are associated\nwith significant distress or impairment in psychosocial function (Criterion D). A diagnosis\nof intermittent explosive disorder should not be given to individuals younger than 6 years,\nor the equivalent developmental level (Criterion E), or to individuals whose aggressive out-\nbursts are better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion F). A diagnosis of intermit-\ntent explosive disorder should not be given to individuals with disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder or to individuals whose impulsive aggressive outbursts are attribut-\nable to another medical condition or to the physiological effects of a substance (Criterion F).\nIn addition, children ages 6–18 years should not receive this diagnosis when impulsive ag-\ngressive outbursts occur in the context of an adjustment disorder (Criterion F).The essential feature of conduct disorder is a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior\nin which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are vi-\nolated (Criterion A). These behaviors fall into four main groupings: aggressive conduct\nthat causes or threatens physical harm to other people or animals (Criteria A1–A7); non-\naggressive conduct that causes property loss or damage (Criteria A8–A9); deceitfulness or\ntheft (Criteria A10–A12); and serious violations of rules (Criteria A13–A15). Three or more\ncharacteristic behaviors must have been present during the past 12 months, with at least\none behavior present in the past 6 months. The disturbance in behavior causes clinically\nsignificant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning (Criterion B). The\nbehavior pattern is usually present in a variety of settings, such as home, at school, or in\nthe community. Because individuals with conduct disorder are likely to minimize their\nconduct problems, the clinician often must rely on additional informants. However, infor-\nmants’ knowledge of the individual’s conduct problems may be limited if they have inad-\nequately supervised the individual or the individual has concealed symptom behaviors.\nIndividuals with conduct disorder often initiate aggressive behavior and react aggres-\nsively to others. They may display bullying, threatening, or intimidating behavior (includ-\ning bullying via messaging on Web-based social media) (Criterion A1); initiate frequent\nphysical fights (Criterion A2); use a weapon that can cause serious physical harm (e.g., a bat,\nbrick, broken bottle, knife, gun) (Criterion A3); be physically cruel to people (Criterion A4)\nor animals (Criterion A5); steal while confronting a victim (e.g., mugging, purse snatching,\nextortion, armed robbery) (Criterion A6); or force someone into sexual activity (Criterion A7).\nPhysical violence may take the form of rape, assault, or, in rare cases, homicide. Deliberate\ndestruction of others’ property may include deliberate fire setting with the intention of caus-\ning serious damage (Criterion A8) or deliberate destroying of other people’s property in\nother ways (e.g., smashing car windows, vandalizing school property) (Criterion A9). Acts of\ndeceitfulness or theft may include breaking into someone else’s house, building, or car (Crite-\nrion A10); frequently lying or breaking promises to obtain goods or favors or to avoid debts\nor obligations (e.g., “conning” other individuals) (Criterion A11); or stealing items of non-\ntrivial value without confronting the victim (e.g., shoplifting, forgery, fraud) (Criterion A12).\nIndividuals with conduct disorder may also frequently commit serious violations of\nrules (e.g., school, parental, workplace). Children with conduct disorder often have a pat-\ntern, beginning before age 13 years, of staying out late at night despite parental prohi-\nbitions (Criterion A13). Children may also show a pattern of running away from home\novernight (Criterion A14). To be considered a symptom of conduct disorder, the running\naway must have occurred at least twice (or only once if the individual did not return for a\nlengthy period). Runaway episodes that occur as a direct consequence of physical or sex-\nual abuse do not typically qualify for this criterion. Children with conduct disorder may\noften be truant from school, beginning prior to age 13 years (Criterion A15).The essential feature of pyromania is the presence of multiple episodes of deliberate and\npurposeful fire setting (Criterion A). Individuals with this disorder experience tension or af-\nfective arousal before setting a fire (Criterion B). There is a fascination with, interest in, cu-\nriosity about, or attraction to fire and its situational contexts (e.g., paraphernalia, uses,\nconsequences) (Criterion C). Individuals with this disorder are often regular “watchers” at\nfires in their neighborhoods, may set off false alarms, and derive pleasure from institutions,\nequipment, and personnel associated with fire. They may spend time at the local fire depart-\nment, set fires to be affiliated with the fire department, or even become firefighters. Individ-\nuals with this disorder experience pleasure, gratification, or relief when setting the fire,\nwitnessing its effects, or participating in its aftermath (Criterion D). The fire setting is not\ndone for monetary gain, as an expression of sociopolitical ideology, to conceal criminal ac-\ntivity, to express anger or vengeance, to improve one’s living circumstances, or in response\nto a delusion or a hallucination (Criterion E). The fire setting does not result from impaired\njudgment (e.g., in major neurocognitive disorder or intellectual disability [intellectual devel-\nopmental disorder]). The diagnosis is not made if the fire setting is better explained by con-\nduct disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial personality disorder (Criterion F).The essential feature of kleptomania is the recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal items\neven though the items are not needed for personal use or for their monetary value (Criterion\nA). The individual experiences a rising subjective sense of tension before the theft (Criterion B)\nand feels pleasure, gratification, or relief when committing the theft (Criterion C). The stealing\nis not committed to express anger or vengeance, is not done in response to a delusion or hal-\nlucination (Criterion D), and is not better explained by conduct disorder, a manic episode, or\nantisocial personality disorder (Criterion E). The objects are stolen despite the fact that they are\ntypically of little value to the individual, who could have afforded to pay for them and often\ngives them away or discards them. Occasionally the individual may hoard the stolen objects or\nsurreptitiously return them. Although individuals with this disorder will generally avoid\nstealing when immediate arrest is probable (e.g., in full view of a police officer), they usually\ndo not preplan the thefts or fully take into account the chances of apprehension. The stealing is\ndone without assistance from, or collaboration with, others.", "associated_features": "Specific learning disorder is frequently but not invariably preceded, in preschool years, by\ndelays in attention, language, or motor skills that may persist and co-occur with specific\nlearning disorder. An uneven profile of abilities is common, such as above-average abili-\nties in drawing, design, and other visuospatial abilities, but slow, effortful, and inaccurate\nreading and poor reading comprehension and written expression. Individuals with spe-\ncific learning disorder typically (but not invariably) exhibit poor performance on psycho-\nlogical tests of cognitive processing. However, it remains unclear whether these cognitive\nabnormalities are the cause, correlate, or consequence of the learning difficulties. Also, al-\nthough cognitive deficits associated with difficulties learning to read words are well doc-\numented, those associated with other manifestations of specific learning disorder (e.g.,\nreading comprehension, arithmetic computation, written expression) are underspecified\nor unknown. Moreover, individuals with similar behavioral symptoms or test scores are\nfound to have a variety of cognitive deficits, and many of these processing deficits are also\nfound in other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disor-\nder [ADHD], autistic spectrum disorder, communication disorders, developmental coor-\ndination disorder). Thus, assessment of cognitive processing deficits is not required for\ndiagnostic assessment. Specific learning disorder is associated with increased risk for sui-\ncidal ideation and suicide attempts in children, adolescents, and adults.\nThere are no known biological markers of specific learning disorder. As a group, indi-\nviduals with the disorder show circumscribed alterations in cognitive processing and\nbrain structure and function. Genetic differences are also evident at the group level. But\ncognitive testing, neuroimaging, or genetic testing are not useful for diagnosis at this time.Some children with developmental coordination disorder show additional (usually sup-\npressed) motor activity, such as choreiform movements of unsupported limbs or mirror\nmovements. These “overflow” movements are referred to as neurodevelopmental immaturities or\nneurological soft signs rather than neurological abnormalities. In both current literature and\nclinical practice, their role in diagnosis is still unclear, requiring further evaluation.Social, marital, or work problems can result from the delusional beliefs of delusional dis-\norder. Individuals with delusional disorder may be able to factually describe that others\nview their beliefs as irrational but are unable to accept this themselves (i.e., there may be\n“factual insight” but no true insight). Many individuals develop irritable or dysphoric\nmood, which can usually be understood as a reaction to their delusional beliefs. Anger and\nviolent behavior can occur with persecutory, jealous, and erotomanic types. The individ-\nual may engage in litigious or antagonistic behavior (e.g., sending hundreds of letters of\nprotest to the government). Legal difficulties can occur, particularly in jealous and eroto-\nmanic types.Individuals with brief psychotic disorder typically experience emotional turmoil or over-\nwhelming confusion. They may have rapid shifts from one intense affect to another.\nAlthough the disturbance is brief, the level of impairment may be severe, and supervision\nmay be required to ensure that nutritional and hygienic needs are met and that the indi-\nvidual is protected from the consequences of poor judgment, cognitive impairment, or act-\ning on the basis of delusions. There appears to be an increased risk of suicidal behavior,\nparticularly during the acute episode.As with schizophrenia, currently there are no laboratory or psychometric tests for schizo-\nphreniform disorder. There are multiple brain regions where neuroimaging, neuropa-\nthological, and neurophysiological research has indicated abnormalities, but none are\ndiagnostic.Individuals with schizophrenia may display inappropriate affect (e.g., laughing in the ab-\nsence of an appropriate stimulus); a dysphoric mood that can take the form of depression,\nanxiety, or anger; a disturbed sleep pattern (e.g., daytime sleeping and nighttime activity);\nand a lack of interest in eating or food refusal. Depersonalization, derealization, and so-\nmatic concerns may occur and sometimes reach delusional proportions. Anxiety and pho-\nbias are common. Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are common and are strongly linked\nto vocational and functional impairments. These deficits can include decrements in declar-\native memory, working memory, language function, and other executive functions, as well\nas slower processing speed. Abnormalities in sensory processing and inhibitory capacity,\nas well as reductions in attention, are also found. Some individuals with schizophrenia\nshow social cognition deficits, including deficits in the ability to infer the intentions of\nother people (theory of mind), and may attend to and then interpret irrelevant events or\nstimuli as meaningful, perhaps leading to the generation of explanatory delusions. These\nimpairments frequently persist during symptomatic remission.\nSome individuals with psychosis may lack insight or awareness of their disorder (i.e.,\nanosognosia). This lack of “insight” includes unawareness of symptoms of schizophrenia\nand may be present throughout the entire course of the illness. Unawareness of illness is\ntypically a symptom of schizophrenia itself rather than a coping strategy. It is comparable\nto the lack of awareness of neurological deficits following brain damage, termed anoso-\ngnosia. This symptom is the most common predictor of non-adherence to treatment, and it\npredicts higher relapse rates, increased number of involuntary treatments, poorer psycho-\nsocial functioning, aggression, and a poorer course of illness.\nHostility and aggression can be associated with schizophrenia, although spontaneous\nor random assault is uncommon. Aggression is more frequent for younger males and for\nindividuals with a past history of violence, non-adherence with treatment, substance\nabuse, and impulsivity. It should be noted that the vast majority of persons with schizo-\nphrenia are not aggressive and are more frequently victimized than are individuals in the\ngeneral population.\nCurrently, there are no radiological, laboratory, or psychometric tests for the disorder.\nDifferences are evident in multiple brain regions between groups of healthy individuals\n102\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\nand persons with schizophrenia, including evidence from neuroimaging, neuropatholog-\nical, and neurophysiological studies. Differences are also evident in cellular architecture,\nwhite matter connectivity, and gray matter volume in a variety of regions such as the pre-\nfrontal and temporal cortices. Reduced overall brain volume has been observed, as well as\nincreased brain volume reduction with age. Brain volume reductions with age are more\npronounced in individuals with schizophrenia than in healthy individuals. Finally, indi-\nviduals with schizophrenia appear to differ from individuals without the disorder in eye-\ntracking and electrophysiological indices.\nNeurological soft signs common in individuals with schizophrenia include impairments\nin motor coordination, sensory integration, and motor sequencing of complex movements;\nleft-right confusion; and disinhibition of associated movements. In addition, minor phys-\nical anomalies of the face and limbs may occur.Occupational functioning is frequently impaired, but this is not a defining criterion (in\ncontrast to schizophrenia). Restricted social contact and difficulties with self-care are as-\nsociated with schizoaffective disorder, but negative symptoms may be less severe and less\npersistent than those seen in schizophrenia. Anosognosia (i.e., poor insight) is also com-\nmon in schizoaffective disorder, but the deficits in insight may be less severe and perva-\nsive than those in schizophrenia. Individuals with schizoaffective disorder may be at\nincreased risk for later developing episodes of major depressive disorder or bipolar disor-\nder if mood symptoms continue following the remission of symptoms meeting Criterion A\nfor schizophrenia. There may be associated alcohol and other substance-related disorders.\nThere are no tests or biological measures that can assist in making the diagnosis of\nschizoaffective disorder. Whether schizoaffective disorder differs from schizophrenia\nwith regard to associated features such as structural or functional brain abnormalities,\ncognitive deficits, or genetic risk factors is not clear.Psychotic disorders can occur in association with intoxication with the following classes of\nsubstances: alcohol; cannabis; hallucinogens, including phencyclidine and related sub-\nstances; inhalants; sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics; stimulants (including cocaine);\nand other (or unknown) substances. Psychotic disorders can occur in association with with-\ndrawal from the following classes of substances: alcohol; sedatives, hypnotics, and anxio-\nlytics; and other (or unknown) substances.\nSome of the medications reported to evoke psychotic symptoms include anesthetics\nand analgesics, anticholinergic agents, anticonvulsants, antihistamines, antihypertensive\nand cardiovascular medications, antimicrobial medications, antiparkinsonian medica-\ntions, chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., cyclosporine, procarbazine), corticosteroids, gastro-\nintestinal medications, muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications,\nother over-the-counter medications (e.g., phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine), antidepres-\nsant medication, and disulfiram. Toxins reported to induce psychotic symptoms include\nanticholinesterase, organophosphate insecticides, sarin and other nerve gases, carbon\nmonoxide, carbon dioxide, and volatile substances such as fuel or paint.The temporal association of the onset or exacerbation of the medical condition offers the\ngreatest diagnostic certainty that the delusions or hallucinations are attributable to a med-\nical condition. Additional factors may include concomitant treatments for the underlying\nmedical condition that confer a risk for psychosis independently, such as steroid treatment\nfor autoimmune disorders.A variety of medical conditions may cause catatonia, especially neurological conditions\n(e.g., neoplasms, head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, encephalitis) and metabolic con-\nditions (e.g., hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, diabetic ketoacido-\nsis). The associated physical examination findings, laboratory findings, and patterns ofDuring a manic episode, individuals often do not perceive that they are ill or in need of treat-\nment and vehemently resist efforts to be treated. Individuals may change their dress, makeup,\nor personal appearance to a more sexually suggestive or flamboyant style. Some perceive a\nsharper sense of smell, hearing, or vision. Gambling and antisocial behaviors may accompany\nthe manic episode. Some individuals may become hostile and physically threatening to others\nand, when delusional, may become physically assaultive or suicidal. Catastrophic conse-\nquences of a manic episode (e.g., involuntary hospitalization, difficulties with the law, serious\nfinancial difficulties) often result from poor judgment, loss of insight, and hyperactivity.\nMood may shift very rapidly to anger or depression. Depressive symptoms may occur\nduring a manic episode and, if present, may last moments, hours, or, more rarely, days (see\n“with mixed features” specifier, pp. 149–150).\n130\nBipolar and Related DisordersA common feature of bipolar II disorder is impulsivity, which can contribute to suicide at-\ntempts and substance use disorders. Impulsivity may also stem from a concurrent person-\nality disorder, substance use disorder, anxiety disorder, another mental disorder, or a\nmedical condition. There may be heightened levels of creativity in some individuals with\na bipolar disorder. However, that relationship may be nonlinear; that is, greater lifetime\ncreative accomplishments have been associated with milder forms of bipolar disorder, and\nhigher creativity has been found in unaffected family members. The individual’s attach-\nment to heightened creativity during hypomanic episodes may contribute to ambivalence\nabout seeking treatment or undermine adherence to treatment.Etiology (causally related to the use of psychotropic medications or substances of abuse\nbased on best clinical evidence) is the key variable in this etiologically specified form of bi-\npolar disorder. Substances/medications that are typically considered to be associated\nwith substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder include the stimulant\nclass of drugs, as well as phencyclidine and steroids; however, a number of potential sub-\nstances continue to emerge as new compounds are synthesized (e.g., so-called bath salts).\nA history of such substance use may help increase diagnostic certainty.Etiology (i.e., a causal relationship to another medical condition based on best clinical ev-\nidence) is the key variable in this etiologically specified form of bipolar disorder. The list-\ning of medical conditions that are said to be able to induce mania is never complete, and\nthe clinician’s best judgment is the essence of this diagnosis. Among the best known of the\nmedical conditions that can cause a bipolar manic or hypomanic condition are Cushing’s\ndisease and multiple sclerosis, as well as stroke and traumatic brain injuries.Major depressive disorder is associated with high mortality, much of which is accounted\nfor by suicide; however, it is not the only cause. For example, depressed individuals ad-\nmitted to nursing homes have a markedly increased likelihood of death in the first year. In-\ndividuals frequently present with tearfulness, irritability, brooding, obsessive rumination,\nanxiety, phobias, excessive worry over physical health, and complaints of pain (e.g., head-\naches; joint, abdominal, or other pains). In children, separation anxiety may occur.\nMajor Depressive Disorder\n165\nAlthough an extensive literature exists describing neuroanatomical, neuroendocrino-\nlogical, and neurophysiological correlates of major depressive disorder, no laboratory test\nhas yielded results of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as a diagnostic tool for\nthis disorder. Until recently, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity had been\nthe most extensively investigated abnormality associated with major depressive episodes,\nand it appears to be associated with melancholia, psychotic features, and risks for eventual\nsuicide. Molecular studies have also implicated peripheral factors, including genetic vari-\nants in neurotrophic factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging studies provide evidence for functional abnormalities in spe-\ncific neural systems supporting emotion processing, reward seeking, and emotion regula-\ntion in adults with major depression.Delusions and hallucinations have been described in the late luteal phase of the menstrual\ncycle but are rare. The premenstrual phase has been considered by some to be a risk period\nfor suicide.Etiology (i.e., a causal relationship to another medical condition based on best clinical ev-\nidence) is the key variable in depressive disorder due to another medical condition. The\nlisting of the medical conditions that are said to be able to induce major depression is never\ncomplete, and the clinician’s best judgment is the essence of this diagnosis.\nThere are clear associations, as well as some neuroanatomical correlates, of depression\nwith stroke, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and traumatic brain injury. Among\nthe neuroendocrine conditions most closely associated with depression are Cushing’s dis-\nease and hypothyroidism. There are numerous other conditions thought to be associated\nwith depression, such as multiple sclerosis. However, the literature’s support for a causal\nassociation is greater with some conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s\ndisease, than with others, for which the differential diagnosis may be adjustment disorder,\nwith depressed mood.When separated from major attachment figures, children with separation anxiety disorder\nmay exhibit social withdrawal, apathy, sadness, or difficulty concentrating on work or\nplay. Depending on their age, individuals may have fears of animals, monsters, the dark,\nmuggers, burglars, kidnappers, car accidents, plane travel, and other situations that are\nperceived as presenting danger to the family or themselves. Some individuals become\nhomesick and uncomfortable to the point of misery when away from home. Separation\nanxiety disorder in children may lead to school refusal, which in turn may lead to academic\ndifficulties and social isolation. When extremely upset at the prospect of separation, chil-\ndren may show anger or occasionally aggression toward someone who is forcing separa-\ntion. When alone, especially in the evening or the dark, young children may report unusual\nperceptual experiences (e.g., seeing people peering into their room, frightening creatures\nreaching for them, feeling eyes staring at them). Children with this disorder may be de-\nscribed as demanding, intrusive, and in need of constant attention, and, as adults, may ap-\npear dependent and overprotective. The individual’s excessive demands often become a\nsource of frustration for family members, leading to resentment and conflict in the family.Associated features of selective mutism may include excessive shyness, fear of social em-\nbarrassment, social isolation and withdrawal, clinging, compulsive traits, negativism,\ntemper tantrums, or mild oppositional behavior. Although children with this disorder\ngenerally have normal language skills, there may occasionally be an associated commu-\n196\nAnxiety Disorders\nnication disorder, although no particular association with a specific communication dis-\norder has been identified. Even when these disorders are present, anxiety is present as\nwell. In clinical settings, children with selective mutism are almost always given an addi-\ntional diagnosis of another anxiety disorder—most commonly, social anxiety disorder (so-\ncial phobia).Individuals with specific phobia typically experience an increase in physiological arousal\nin anticipation of or during exposure to a phobic object or situation. However, the physi-\nological response to the feared situation or object varies. Whereas individuals with situa-\ntional, natural environment, and animal specific phobias are likely to show sympathetic\nnervous system arousal, individuals with blood-injection-injury specific phobia often\ndemonstrate a vasovagal fainting or near-fainting response that is marked by initial brief\nacceleration of heart rate and elevation of blood pressure followed by a deceleration of\nheart rate and a drop in blood pressure. Current neural systems models for specific phobia\nemphasize the amygdala and related structures, much as in other anxiety disorders.Individuals with social anxiety disorder may be inadequately assertive or excessively sub-\nmissive or, less commonly, highly controlling of the conversation. They may show overly\nrigid body posture or inadequate eye contact, or speak with an overly soft voice. These in-\ndividuals may be shy or withdrawn, and they may be less open in conversations and dis-\nclose little about themselves. They may seek employment in jobs that do not require social\ncontact, although this is not the case for individuals with social anxiety disorder, perfor-\nmance only. They may live at home longer. Men may be delayed in marrying and having\na family, whereas women who would want to work outside the home may live a life as\nhomemaker and mother. Self-medication with substances is common (e.g., drinking be-\nfore going to a party). Social anxiety among older adults may also include exacerbation of\nsymptoms of medical illnesses, such as increased tremor or tachycardia. Blushing is a hall-\nmark physical response of social anxiety disorder.One type of unexpected panic attack is a nocturnal panic attack (i.e., waking from sleep in\na state of panic, which differs from panicking after fully waking from sleep). In the United\nStates, this type of panic attack has been estimated to occur at least one time in roughly\none-quarter to one-third of individuals with panic disorder, of whom the majority also\nhave daytime panic attacks. In addition to worry about panic attacks and their conse-\nquences, many individuals with panic disorder report constant or intermittent feelings of\nanxiety that are more broadly related to health and mental health concerns. For example,\nindividuals with panic disorder often anticipate a catastrophic outcome from a mild phys-\nical symptom or medication side effect (e.g., thinking that they may have heart disease or\nthat a headache means presence of a brain tumor). Such individuals often are relatively in-\ntolerant of medication side effects. In addition, there may be pervasive concerns about\nabilities to complete daily tasks or withstand daily stressors, excessive use of drugs (e.g.,\nalcohol, prescribed medications or illicit drugs) to control panic attacks, or extreme behav-\niors aimed at controlling panic attacks (e.g., severe restrictions on food intake or avoidance\nof specific foods or medications because of concerns about physical symptoms that pro-\nvoke panic attacks).In its most severe forms, agoraphobia can cause individuals to become completely home-\nbound, unable to leave their home and dependent on others for services or assistance to pro-\nvide even for basic needs. Demoralization and depressive symptoms, as well as abuse of\nalcohol and sedative medication as inappropriate self-medication strategies, are common.Associated with muscle tension, there may be trembling, twitching, feeling shaky, and\nmuscle aches or soreness. Many individuals with generalized anxiety disorder also expe-\nrience somatic symptoms (e.g., sweating, nausea, diarrhea) and an exaggerated startle re-\nsponse. Symptoms of autonomic hyperarousal (e.g., accelerated heart rate, shortness of\nbreath, dizziness) are less prominent in generalized anxiety disorder than in other anxiety\ndisorders, such as panic disorder. Other conditions that may be associated with stress (e.g.,\nirritable bowel syndrome, headaches) frequently accompany generalized anxiety disorder.Panic or anxiety can occur in association with intoxication with the following classes of sub-\nstances: alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, phencyclidine, other hallucinogens, inhalants, stimu-\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder\n229\nlants (including cocaine), and other (or unknown) substances. Panic or anxiety can occur in\nassociation with withdrawal from the following classes of substances: alcohol; opioids; sed-\natives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics; stimulants (including cocaine); and other (or unknown)\nsubstances. Some medications that evoke anxiety symptoms include anesthetics and anal-\ngesics, sympathomimetics or other bronchodilators, anticholinergics, insulin, thyroid prep-\narations, oral contraceptives, antihistamines, antiparkinsonian medications, corticosteroids,\nantihypertensive and cardiovascular medications, anticonvulsants, lithium carbonate, an-\ntipsychotic medications, and antidepressant medications. Heavy metals and toxins (e.g.,\norganophosphate insecticide, nerve gases, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, volatile sub-\nstances such as gasoline and paint) may also cause panic or anxiety symptoms.A number of medical conditions are known to include anxiety as a symptomatic manifes-\ntation. Examples include endocrine disease (e.g., hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma,\nhypoglycemia, hyperadrenocortisolism), cardiovascular disorders (e.g., congestive heart\nfailure, pulmonary embolism, arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation), respiratory illness\n(e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pneumonia), metabolic distur-\nbances (e.g., vitamin B12 deficiency, porphyria), and neurological illness (e.g., neoplasms,\nvestibular dysfunction, encephalitis, seizure disorders). Anxiety due to another medical\ncondition is diagnosed when the medical condition is known to induce anxiety and when\nthe medical condition preceded the onset of the anxiety.The specific content of obsessions and compulsions varies between individuals. However,\ncertain themes, or dimensions, are common, including those of cleaning (contamination\nobsessions and cleaning compulsions); symmetry (symmetry obsessions and repeating,\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder\n239\nordering, and counting compulsions); forbidden or taboo thoughts (e.g., aggressive, sexual,\nor religious obsessions and related compulsions); and harm (e.g., fears of harm to oneself\nor others and checking compulsions). Some individuals also have difficulties discarding\nand accumulate (hoard) objects as a consequence of typical obsessions and compulsions,\nsuch as fears of harming others. These themes occur across different cultures, are rela-\ntively consistent over time in adults with the disorder, and may be associated with differ-\nent neural substrates. Importantly, individuals often have symptoms in more than one\ndimension.\nIndividuals with OCD experience a range of affective responses when confronted with\nsituations that trigger obsessions and compulsions. For example, many individuals expe-\nrience marked anxiety that can include recurrent panic attacks. Others report strong feel-\nings of disgust. While performing compulsions, some individuals report a distressing\nsense of “incompleteness” or uneasiness until things look, feel, or sound “just right.”\nIt is common for individuals with the disorder to avoid people, places, and things that\ntrigger obsessions and compulsions. For example, individuals with contamination con-\ncerns might avoid public situations (e.g., restaurants, public restrooms) to reduce ex-\nposure to feared contaminants; individuals with intrusive thoughts about causing harm\nmight avoid social interactions.Many individuals with body dysmorphic disorder have ideas or delusions of reference,\nbelieving that other people take special notice of them or mock them because of how they\nlook. Body dysmorphic disorder is associated with high levels of anxiety, social anxiety,\nsocial avoidance, depressed mood, neuroticism, and perfectionism as well as low extro-\nversion and low self-esteem. Many individuals are ashamed of their appearance and their\nexcessive focus on how they look, and are reluctant to reveal their concerns to others. A\nmajority of individuals receive cosmetic treatment to try to improve their perceived de-\nfects. Dermatological treatment and surgery are most common, but any type (e.g., dental,\nelectrolysis) may be received. Occasionally, individuals may perform surgery on them-\nselves. Body dysmorphic disorder appears to respond poorly to such treatments and\nsometimes becomes worse. Some individuals take legal action or are violent toward the\nclinician because they are dissatisfied with the cosmetic outcome.\nBody dysmorphic disorder has been associated with executive dysfunction and visual\nprocessing abnormalities, with a bias for analyzing and encoding details rather than ho-\nlistic or configural aspects of visual stimuli. Individuals with this disorder tend to have a\nbias for negative and threatening interpretations of facial expressions and ambiguous sce-\nnarios.Other common features of hoarding disorder include indecisiveness, perfectionism,\navoidance, procrastination, difficulty planning and organizing tasks, and distractibility.\nSome individuals with hoarding disorder live in unsanitary conditions that may be a log-\nical consequence of severely cluttered spaces and/or that are related to planning and or-\nganizing difficulties. Animal hoarding can be defined as the accumulation of a large number\nof animals and a failure to provide minimal standards of nutrition, sanitation, and veter-\ninary care and to act on the deteriorating condition of the animals (including disease, star-\nvation, or death) and the environment (e.g., severe overcrowding, extremely unsanitary\nconditions). Animal hoarding may be a special manifestation of hoarding disorder. Most\nindividuals who hoard animals also hoard inanimate objects. The most prominent differ-\nences between animal and object hoarding are the extent of unsanitary conditions and the\npoorer insight in animal hoarding.Hair pulling may be accompanied by a range of behaviors or rituals involving hair. Thus,\nindividuals may search for a particular kind of hair to pull (e.g., hairs with a specific tex-\nture or color), may try to pull out hair in a specific way (e.g., so that the root comes out in-\ntact), or may visually examine or tactilely or orally manipulate the hair after it has been\npulled (e.g., rolling the hair between the fingers, pulling the strand between the teeth, bit-\ning the hair into pieces, or swallowing the hair).\nHair pulling may also be preceded or accompanied by various emotional states; it may\nbe triggered by feelings of anxiety or boredom, may be preceded by an increasing sense of\ntension (either immediately before pulling out the hair or when attempting to resist the\nurge to pull), or may lead to gratification, pleasure, or a sense of relief when the hair is\npulled out. Hair-pulling behavior may involve varying degrees of conscious awareness,\nwith some individuals displaying more focused attention on the hair pulling (with pre-\nceding tension and subsequent relief), and other individuals displaying more automatic\nbehavior (in which the hair pulling seems to occur without full awareness). Many individ-\nuals report a mix of both behavioral styles. Some individuals experience an “itch-like” or\ntingling sensation in the scalp that is alleviated by the act of pulling hair. Pain does not\nusually accompany hair pulling.\nPatterns of hair loss are highly variable. Areas of complete alopecia, as well as areas of\nthinned hair density, are common. When the scalp is involved, there may be a predilection\nfor pulling out hair in the crown or parietal regions. There may be a pattern of nearly com-\nplete baldness except for a narrow perimeter around the outer margins of the scalp, par-\nticularly at the nape of the neck (“tonsure trichotillomania”). Eyebrows and eyelashes may\nbe completely absent.\nHair pulling does not usually occur in the presence of other individuals, except imme-\ndiate family members. Some individuals have urges to pull hair from other individuals\nand may sometimes try to find opportunities to do so surreptitiously. Some individuals\nmay pull hairs from pets, dolls, and other fibrous materials (e.g., sweaters or carpets).\nSome individuals may deny their hair pulling to others. The majority of individuals with\ntrichotillomania also have one or more other body-focused repetitive behaviors, including\nskin picking, nail biting, and lip chewing.Skin picking may be accompanied by a range of behaviors or rituals involving skin or scabs.\nThus, individuals may search for a particular kind of scab to pull, and they may examine,\nplay with, or mouth or swallow the skin after it has been pulled. Skin picking may also be pre-\nceded or accompanied by various emotional states. Skin picking may be triggered by feelings\nof anxiety or boredom, may be preceded by an increasing sense of tension (either immedi-\nately before picking the skin or when attempting to resist the urge to pick), and may lead to\ngratification, pleasure, or a sense of relief when the skin or scab has been picked. Some indi-\nviduals report picking in response to a minor skin irregularity or to relieve an uncomfortable\nbodily sensation. Pain is not routinely reported to accompany skin picking. Some individuals\nengage in skin picking that is more focused (i.e., with preceding tension and subsequent re-\nlief), whereas others engage in more automatic picking (i.e., when skin picking occurs with-\nout preceding tension and without full awareness), and many have a mix of both behavioral\nstyles. Skin picking does not usually occur in the presence of other individuals, except im-\nmediate family members. Some individuals report picking the skin of others.Obsessions, compulsions, hair pulling, skin picking, or other body-focused repetitive be-\nhaviors can occur in association with intoxication with the following classes of substances:\nstimulants (including cocaine) and other (or unknown) substances. Heavy metals and tox-\nins may also cause obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms. Laboratory as-\nsessments (e.g., urine toxicology) may be useful to measure substance intoxication as part\nof an assessment for obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.A number of other medical disorders are known to include obsessive-compulsive and re-\nlated symptoms as a manifestation. Examples include disorders leading to striatal dam-\nage, such as cerebral infarction.Because of the shared etiological association with social neglect, reactive attachment dis-\norder often co-occurs with developmental delays, especially in delays in cognition and\nlanguage. Other associated features include stereotypies and other signs of severe neglect\n(e.g., malnutrition or signs of poor care).Because of the shared etiological association with social neglect, disinhibited social en-\ngagement disorder may co-occur with developmental delays, especially cognitive and lan-\nguage delays, stereotypies, and other signs of severe neglect, such as malnutrition or poor\ncare. However, signs of the disorder often persist even after these other signs of neglect are\nno longer present. Therefore, it is not uncommon for children with the disorder to present\nwith no current signs of neglect. Moreover, the condition can present in children who\nshow no signs of disordered attachment. Thus, disinhibited social engagement disorder\nmay be seen in children with a history of neglect who lack attachments or whose attach-\nments to their caregivers range from disturbed to secure.Developmental regression, such as loss of language in young children, may occur. Audi-\ntory pseudo-hallucinations, such as having the sensory experience of hearing one’s\nthoughts spoken in one or more different voices, as well as paranoid ideation, can be pres-\nent. Following prolonged, repeated, and severe traumatic events (e.g., childhood abuse,\ntorture), the individual may additionally experience difficulties in regulating emotions or\nmaintaining stable interpersonal relationships, or dissociative symptoms. When the trau-\nmatic event produces violent death, symptoms of both problematic bereavement and PTSD\nmay be present.Individuals with acute stress disorder commonly engage in catastrophic or extremely neg-\native thoughts about their role in the traumatic event, their response to the traumatic ex-\nperience, or the likelihood of future harm. For example, an individual with acute stress\ndisorder may feel excessively guilty about not having prevented the traumatic event or\nabout not adapting to the experience more successfully. Individuals with acute stress dis-\norder may also interpret their symptoms in a catastrophic manner, such that flashback\nmemories or emotional numbing may be interpreted as a sign of diminished mental ca-\npacity. It is common for individuals with acute stress disorder to experience panic attacks\nin the initial month after trauma exposure that may be triggered by trauma reminders or\nmay apparently occur spontaneously. Additionally, individuals with acute stress disorder\nmay display chaotic or impulsive behavior. For example, individuals may drive reck-\nlessly, make irrational decisions, or gamble excessively. In children, there may be sig-\nnificant separation anxiety, possibly manifested by excessive needs for attention from\n284\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\ncaregivers. In the case of bereavement following a death that occurred in traumatic cir-\ncumstances, the symptoms of acute stress disorder can involve acute grief reactions. In\nsuch cases, reexperiencing, dissociative, and arousal symptoms may involve reactions to\nthe loss, such as intrusive memories of the circumstances of the individual’s death, disbe-\nlief that the individual has died, and anger about the death. Postconcussive symptoms\n(e.g., headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, irritability, concentration deficits),\nwhich occur frequently following mild traumatic brain injury, are also frequently seen in\nindividuals with acute stress disorder. Postconcussive symptoms are equally common in\nbrain-injured and non–brain-injured populations, and the frequent occurrence of postcon-\ncussive symptoms could be attributable to acute stress disorder symptoms.Individuals with dissociative identity disorder typically present with comorbid depression,\nanxiety, substance abuse, self-injury, non-epileptic seizures, or another common symp-\ntom. They often conceal, or are not fully aware of, disruptions in consciousness, amnesia,\nor other dissociative symptoms. Many individuals with dissociative identity disorder re-\nport dissociative flashbacks during which they undergo a sensory reliving of a previous\nevent as though it were occurring in the present, often with a change of identity, a partial\nor complete loss of contact with or disorientation to current reality during the flashback,\nand a subsequent amnesia for the content of the flashback. Individuals with the disorder\ntypically report multiple types of interpersonal maltreatment during childhood and adult-\nhood. Nonmaltreatment forms of overwhelming early life events, such as multiple long,\npainful, early-life medical procedures, also may be reported. Self-mutilation and suicidal\nbehavior are frequent. On standardized measures, these individuals report higher levels\nof hypnotizability and dissociativity compared with other clinical groups and healthy con-\ntrol subjects. Some individuals experience transient psychotic phenomena or episodes.\nSeveral brain regions have been implicated in the pathophysiology of dissociative identity\ndisorder, including the orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and\namygdala.Many individuals with dissociative amnesia are chronically impaired in their ability to\nform and sustain satisfactory relationships. Histories of trauma, child abuse, and victim-\nization are common. Some individuals with dissociative amnesia report dissociative flash-\nbacks (i.e., behavioral reexperiencing of traumatic events). Many have a history of self-\nmutilation, suicide attempts, and other high-risk behaviors. Depressive and functional\nneurological symptoms are common, as are depersonalization, auto-hypnotic symptoms,\nand high hypnotizability. Sexual dysfunctions are common. Mild traumatic brain injury\nmay precede dissociative amnesia.Individuals with depersonalization/derealization disorder may have difficulty describ-\ning their symptoms and may think they are “crazy” or “going crazy”. Another common\nexperience is the fear of irreversible brain damage. A commonly associated symptom is a\nsubjectively altered sense of time (i.e., too fast or too slow), as well as a subjective difficulty\nin vividly recalling past memories and owning them as personal and emotional. Vague so-\nmatic symptoms, such as head fullness, tingling, or lightheadedness, are not uncommon.\nIndividuals may suffer extreme rumination or obsessional preoccupation (e.g., constantly\nobsessing about whether they really exist, or checking their perceptions to determine\nwhether they appear real). Varying degrees of anxiety and depression are also common as-\nsociated features. Individuals with the disorder have been found to have physiological\nhyporeactivity to emotional stimuli. Neural substrates of interest include the hypotha-\nlamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, inferior parietal lobule, and prefrontal cortical-limbic\ncircuits.Cognitive features include attention focused on somatic symptoms, attribution of normal\nbodily sensations to physical illness (possibly with catastrophic interpretations), worry\nabout illness, and fear that any physical activity may damage the body. The relevant as-\nsociated behavioral features may include repeated bodily checking for abnormalities, re-\npeated seeking of medical help and reassurance, and avoidance of physical activity. These\nbehavioral features are most pronounced in severe, persistent somatic symptom disorder.\nThese features are usually associated with frequent requests for medical help for different\nsomatic symptoms. This may lead to medical consultations in which individuals are so fo-\ncused on their concerns about somatic symptom(s) that they cannot be redirected to other\nmatters. Any reassurance by the doctor that the symptoms are not indicative of serious\nphysical illness tends to be short-lived and/or is experienced by the individuals as the\ndoctor not taking their symptoms with due seriousness. As the focus on somatic symp-\ntoms is a primary feature of the disorder, individuals with somatic symptom disorder typ-\nically present to general medical health services rather than mental health services. The\nsuggestion of referral to a mental health specialist may be met with surprise or even frank\nrefusal by individuals with somatic symptom disorder.\nSince somatic symptom disorder is associated with depressive disorders, there is an in-\ncreased suicide risk. It is not known whether somatic symptom disorder is associated withBecause they believe they are medically ill, individuals with illness anxiety disorder are\nencountered far more frequently in medical than in mental health settings. The majority of\nindividuals with illness anxiety disorder have extensive yet unsatisfactory medical care,\nthough some may be too anxious to seek medical attention. They generally have elevated\nrates of medical utilization but do not utilize mental health services more than the general\npopulation. They often consult multiple physicians for the same problem and obtain re-\npeatedly negative diagnostic test results. At times, medical attention leads to a paradoxical\nexacerbation of anxiety or to iatrogenic complications from diagnostic tests and proce-\ndures. Individuals with the disorder are generally dissatisfied with their medical care and\nfind it unhelpful, often feeling they are not being taken seriously by physicians. At times,\nthese concerns may be justified, since physicians sometimes are dismissive or respond\nwith frustration or hostility. This response can occasionally result in a failure to diagnose\na medical condition that is present.A number of associated features can support the diagnosis of conversion disorder. There\nmay be a history of multiple similar somatic symptoms. Onset may be associated with\nstress or trauma, either psychological or physical in nature. The potential etiological rele-\n320\nSomatic Symptom and Related Disorders\nvance of this stress or trauma may be suggested by a close temporal relationship. However,\nwhile assessment for stress and trauma is important, the diagnosis should not be withheld\nif none is found.\nConversion disorder is often associated with dissociative symptoms, such as deperson-\nalization, derealization, and dissociative amnesia, particularly at symptom onset or during\nattacks.\nThe diagnosis of conversion disorder does not require the judgment that the symptoms\nare not intentionally produced (i.e., not feigned), as the definite absence of feigning may\nnot be reliably discerned. The phenomenon of la belle indifférence (i.e., lack of concern about\nthe nature or implications of the symptom) has been associated with conversion disorder\nbut it is not specific for conversion disorder and should not be used to make the diagnosis.\nSimilarly the concept of secondary gain (i.e., when individuals derive external benefits such\nas money or release from responsibilities) is also not specific to conversion disorder and\nparticularly in the context of definite evidence for feigning, the diagnoses that should be\nconsidered instead would include factitious disorder or malingering (see the section “Dif-\nferential Diagnosis” for this disorder).Individuals with factitious disorder imposed on self or factitious disorder imposed on an-\nother are at risk for experiencing great psychological distress or functional impairment by\ncausing harm to themselves and others. Family, friends, and health care professionals are\nalso often adversely affected by their behavior. Factitious disorders have similarities to\nsubstance use disorders, eating disorders, impulse-control disorders, pedophilic disorder,\nand some other established disorders related to both the persistence of the behavior and\nthe intentional efforts to conceal the disordered behavior through deception. Whereas\nsome aspects of factitious disorders might represent criminal behavior (e.g., factitious dis-\n326\nSomatic Symptom and Related Disorders\norder imposed on another, in which the parent’s actions represent abuse and maltreat-\nment of a child), such criminal behavior and mental illness are not mutually exclusive. The\ndiagnosis of factitious disorder emphasizes the objective identification of falsification of\nsigns and symptoms of illness, rather than an inference about intent or possible underly-\ning motivation. Moreover, such behaviors, including the induction of injury or disease, are\nassociated with deception.Although deficiencies in vitamins or minerals (e.g., zinc, iron) have been reported in some\ninstances, often no specific biological abnormalities are found. In some cases, pica comes\nto clinical attention only following general medical complications (e.g., mechanical bowel\nproblems; intestinal obstruction, such as that resulting from a bezoar; intestinal perfora-\ntion; infections such as toxoplasmosis and toxocariasis as a result of ingesting feces or dirt;\npoisoning, such as by ingestion of lead-based paint).Infants with rumination disorder display a characteristic position of straining and arching\nthe back with the head held back, making sucking movements with their tongue. They\nmay give the impression of gaining satisfaction from the activity. They may be irritable\nand hungry between episodes of regurgitation. Weight loss and failure to make expected\nweight gains are common features in infants with rumination disorder. Malnutrition may\noccur despite the infant’s apparent hunger and the ingestion of relatively large amounts of\nfood, particularly in severe cases, when regurgitation immediately follows each feeding\nepisode and regurgitated food is expelled. Malnutrition might also occur in older children\nand adults, particularly when the regurgitation is accompanied by restriction of intake.\nAdolescents and adults may attempt to disguise the regurgitation behavior by placing a\nRumination Disorder\n333\nhand over the mouth or coughing. Some will avoid eating with others because of the ac-\nknowledged social undesirability of the behavior. This may extend to an avoidance of eat-\ning prior to social situations, such as work or school (e.g., avoiding breakfast because it\nmay be followed by regurgitation).Several features may be associated with food avoidance or reduced food intake, including\na lack of interest in eating or food, leading to weight loss or faltering growth. Very young\ninfants may present as being too sleepy, distressed, or agitated to feed. Infants and young\nchildren may not engage with the primary caregiver during feeding or communicate hun-\nger in favor of other activities. In older children and adolescents, food avoidance or restric-\ntion may be associated with more generalized emotional difficulties that do not meetThe semi-starvation of anorexia nervosa, and the purging behaviors sometimes associated\nwith it, can result in significant and potentially life-threatening medical conditions. The\nnutritional compromise associated with this disorder affects most major organ systems\nand can produce a variety of disturbances. Physiological disturbances, including amenor-\nrhea and vital sign abnormalities, are common. While most of the physiological distur-\nbances associated with malnutrition are reversible with nutritional rehabilitation, some,\nincluding loss of bone mineral density, are often not completely reversible. Behaviors such\nas self-induced vomiting and misuse of laxatives, diuretics, and enemas may cause a num-\nber of disturbances that lead to abnormal laboratory findings; however, some individuals\nwith anorexia nervosa exhibit no laboratory abnormalities.\nWhen seriously underweight, many individuals with anorexia nervosa have depressive\nsigns and symptoms such as depressed mood, social withdrawal, irritability, insomnia, and\ndiminished interest in sex. Because these features are also observed in individuals without\nanorexia nervosa who are significantly undernourished, many of the depressive features\nmay be secondary to the physiological sequelae of semi-starvation, although they may also\nbe sufficiently severe to warrant an additional diagnosis of major depressive disorder.\nObsessive-compulsive features, both related and unrelated to food, are often prominent.\nMost individuals with anorexia nervosa are preoccupied with thoughts of food. Some col-\nlect recipes or hoard food. Observations of behaviors associated with other forms of star-\nvation suggest that obsessions and compulsions related to food may be exacerbated by\nundernutrition. When individuals with anorexia nervosa exhibit obsessions and compul-\nsions that are not related to food, body shape, or weight, an additional diagnosis of obses-\nsive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may be warranted.\nOther features sometimes associated with anorexia nervosa include concerns about\neating in public, feelings of ineffectiveness, a strong desire to control one’s environment,\ninflexible thinking, limited social spontaneity, and overly restrained emotional ex-\npression. Compared with individuals with anorexia nervosa, restricting type, those with\nbinge-eating/purging type have higher rates of impulsivity and are more likely to abuse\nalcohol and other drugs.\nA subgroup of individuals with anorexia nervosa show excessive levels of physical ac-\ntivity. Increases in physical activity often precede onset of the disorder, and over the\ncourse of the disorder increased activity accelerates weight loss. During treatment, exces-\nsive activity may be difficult to control, thereby jeopardizing weight recovery.\nIndividuals with anorexia nervosa may misuse medications, such as by manipulating\ndosage, in order to achieve weight loss or avoid weight gain. Individuals with diabetes\nmellitus may omit or reduce insulin doses in order to minimize carbohydrate metabolism.Individuals with bulimia nervosa typically are within the normal weight or overweight\nrange (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 18.5 and < 30 in adults). The disorder occurs but is un-\ncommon among obese individuals. Between eating binges, individuals with bulimia ner-\nvosa typically restrict their total caloric consumption and preferentially select low-calorie\n(“diet”) foods while avoiding foods that they perceive to be fattening or likely to trigger a\nbinge.\nMenstrual irregularity or amenorrhea often occurs among females with bulimia ner-\nvosa; it is uncertain whether such disturbances are related to weight fluctuations, to nu-\ntritional deficiencies, or to emotional distress. The fluid and electrolyte disturbances\nresulting from the purging behavior are sometimes sufficiently severe to constitute med-\nically serious problems. Rare but potentially fatal complications include esophageal tears,\ngastric rupture, and cardiac arrhythmias. Serious cardiac and skeletal myopathies have\nbeen reported among individuals following repeated use of syrup of ipecac to induce vom-\niting. Individuals who chronically abuse laxatives may become dependent on their use to\nstimulate bowel movements. Gastrointestinal symptoms are commonly associated with\nbulimia nervosa, and rectal prolapse has also been reported among individuals with this\ndisorder.Binge-eating disorder occurs in normal-weight/overweight and obese individuals. It is re-\nliably associated with overweight and obesity in treatment-seeking individuals. Never-\ntheless, binge-eating disorder is distinct from obesity. Most obese individuals do not\nengage in recurrent binge eating. In addition, compared with weight-matched obese indi-\nviduals without binge-eating disorder, those with the disorder consume more calories in\nlaboratory studies of eating behavior and have greater functional impairment, lower qual-\nity of life, more subjective distress, and greater psychiatric comorbidity.During nocturnal enuresis, occasionally the voiding takes place during rapid eye movement\n(REM) sleep, and the child may recall a dream that involved the act of urinating. During day-\ntime (diurnal) enuresis, the child defers voiding until incontinence occurs, sometimes because\nof a reluctance to use the toilet as a result of social anxiety or a preoccupation with school or\nplay activity. The enuretic event most commonly occurs in the early afternoon on school days\nand may be associated with symptoms of disruptive behavior. The enuresis commonly per-\nsists after appropriate treatment of an associated infection.The child with encopresis often feels ashamed and may wish to avoid situations (e.g.,\ncamp, school) that might lead to embarrassment. The amount of impairment is a function\nof the effect on the child's self-esteem, the degree of social ostracism by peers, and the an-\nger, punishment, and rejection on the part of caregivers. Smearing feces may be deliberate\nor accidental, resulting from the child’s attempt to clean or hide feces that were passed in-\nvoluntarily. When the incontinence is clearly deliberate, features of oppositional defiant\ndisorder or conduct disorder may also be present. Many children with encopresis and\nchronic constipation also have enuresis symptoms and may have associated urinary reflux\nin the bladder or ureters that may lead to chronic urinary infections, the symptoms of\nwhich may remit with treatment of the constipation.\nOther Specified Elimination Disorder\n359Insomnia is often associated with physiological and cognitive arousal and conditioning\nfactors that interfere with sleep. A preoccupation with sleep and distress due to the inabil-\nity to sleep may lead to a vicious cycle: the more the individual strives to sleep, the more\nfrustration builds and further impairs sleep. Thus, excessive attention and efforts to sleep,\nwhich override normal sleep-onset mechanisms, may contribute to the development of in-\nsomnia. Individuals with persistent insomnia may also acquire maladaptive sleep habits\n(e.g., spending excessive time in bed; following an erratic sleep schedule; napping) and\ncognitions (e.g., fear of sleeplessness; apprehensions of daytime impairments; clock mon-\nitoring) during the course of the disorder. Engaging in such activities in an environment in\nwhich the individual has frequently spent sleepless nights may further compound the con-\nditioned arousal and perpetuate sleep difficulties. Conversely, the individual may fall asleep\nmore easily when not trying to do so. Some individuals also report better sleep when away\nfrom their own bedrooms and their usual routines.\nInsomnia may be accompanied by a variety of daytime complaints and symptoms, in-\ncluding fatigue, decreased energy, and mood disturbances. Symptoms of anxiety or de-\npression that do not meet criteria for a specific mental disorder may be present, as well as\nan excessive focus on the perceived effects of sleep loss on daytime functioning.\nIndividuals with insomnia may have elevated scores on self-report psychological or\npersonality inventories with profiles indicating mild depression and anxiety, a worrisome\ncognitive style, an emotion-focused and internalizing style of conflict resolution, and a so-\nmatic focus. Patterns of neurocognitive impairment among individuals with insomnia dis-\norder are inconsistent, although there may be impairments in performing tasks of higher\ncomplexity and those requiring frequent changes in performance strategy. Individuals\nwith insomnia often require more effort to maintain cognitive performance.Nonrestorative sleep, automatic behavior, difficulties awakening in the morning, and\nsleep inertia, although common in hypersomnolence disorder, may also be seen in a variety\nof conditions, including narcolepsy. Approximately 80% of individuals with hyper-\nsomnolence report that their sleep is nonrestorative, and as many have difficulties awak-\nening in the morning. Sleep inertia, though less common (i.e., observed in 36%–50% of\nindividuals with hypersomnolence disorder), is highly specific to hypersomnolence. Short\nnaps (i.e., duration of less than 30 minutes) are often unrefreshing. Individuals with hy-\npersomnolence often appear sleepy and may even fall asleep in the clinician’s waiting\narea.\nA subset of individuals with hypersomnolence disorder have a family history of hy-\npersomnolence and also have symptoms of autonomic nervous system dysfunction, in-\ncluding recurrent vascular-type headaches, reactivity of the peripheral vascular system\n(Raynaud’s phenomenon), and fainting.When sleepiness is severe, automatic behaviors may occur, with the individual continuing\nhis or her activities in a semi-automatic, hazelike fashion without memory or conscious-\nness. Approximately 20%–60% of individuals experience vivid hypnagogic hallucinations\nNarcolepsy\n375\nbefore or upon falling asleep or hypnopompic hallucinations just after awakening. These\nhallucinations are distinct from the less vivid, nonhallucinatory dreamlike mentation at\nsleep onset that occurs in normal sleepers. Nightmares and vivid dreaming are also fre-\nquent in narcolepsy, as is REM sleep behavior disorder. Approximately 20%–60% of indi-\nviduals experience sleep paralysis upon falling asleep or awakening, leaving them awake\nbut unable to move or speak. However, many normal sleepers also report sleep paralysis,\nespecially with stress or sleep deprivation. Nocturnal eating may occur. Obesity is com-\nmon. Nocturnal sleep disruption with frequent long or short awakenings is common and\ncan be disabling.\nIndividuals may appear sleepy or fall asleep in the waiting area or during clinical ex-\namination. During cataplexy, individuals may slump in a chair and have slurred speech or\ndrooping eyelids. If the clinician has time to check reflexes during cataplexy (most attacks\nare less than 10 seconds), reflexes are abolished—an important finding distinguishing gen-\nuine cataplexy from conversion disorder.Because of the frequency of nocturnal awakenings that occur with obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea, individuals may report symptoms of insomnia. Other common, though non-\nspecific, symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea are heartburn, nocturia, morning\nheadaches, dry mouth, erectile dysfunction, and reduced libido. Rarely, individuals may\ncomplain of difficulty breathing while lying supine or sleeping. Hypertension may occur\nin more than 60% of individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea.Individuals with central sleep apnea hypopneas can manifest with sleepiness or insomnia.\nThere can be complaints of sleep fragmentation, including awakening with dyspnea.\nSome individuals are asymptomatic. Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea can coexist with\nCheyne-Stokes breathing, and thus snoring and abruptly terminating apneas may be ob-\nserved during sleep.Individuals with sleep-related hypoventilation can present with sleep-related complaints\nof insomnia or sleepiness. Episodes of orthopnea can occur in individuals with diaphragm\nweakness. Headaches upon awakening may be present. During sleep, episodes of shallow\nbreathing may be observed, and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea or central sleep apnea\nmay coexist. Consequences of ventilatory insufficiency, including pulmonary hyperten-\nsion, cor pulmonale (right heart failure), polycythemia, and neurocognitive dysfunction,\n388\nSleep-Wake Disorders\ncan be present. With progression of ventilatory insufficiency, blood gas abnormalities ex-\ntend into wakefulness. Features of the medical condition causing sleep-related hypoven-\ntilation can also be present. Episodes of hypoventilation may be associated with frequent\narousals or bradytachycardia. Individuals may complain of excessive sleepiness and in-\nsomnia or morning headaches or may present with findings of neurocognitive dysfunction\nor depression. Hypoventilation may not be present during wakefulness.Common associated features of delayed sleep phase type include a history of mental dis-\norders or a concurrent mental disorder. Extreme and prolonged difficulty awakening with\nmorning confusion is also common. Psychophysiological insomnia may develop as a re-\nsult of maladaptive behaviors that impair sleep and increase arousal because of repeated\nattempts to fall asleep at an earlier time.Individuals with advanced sleep phase type are “morning types,” having earlier sleep-\nwake times, with the timing of circadian biomarkers such as melatonin and core body tem-\nperature rhythms occurring 2–4 hours earlier than normal. When required to keep a con-\nventional schedule requiring a delay of bedtime, these individuals will continue to have an\nearly rise time, leading to persistent sleep deprivation and daytime sleepiness. Use of hyp-\nnotics or alcohol to combat sleep-maintenance insomnia and stimulants to reduce daytime\nsleepiness may lead to substance abuse in these individuals.Individuals with irregular sleep-wake type typically present with insomnia or excessive\nsleepiness, depending on the time of day. Sleep and wake periods across 24 hours are frag-\nmented, although the longest sleep period tends to occur between 2:00 A.M. and 6:00 A.M.\nand is usually less than 4 hours. A history of isolation or reclusion may occur in association\nwith the disorder and contribute to the symptoms via a lack of external stimuli to help en-\ntrain a normal pattern. Individuals or their caregivers report frequent naps throughout the\nday. Irregular sleep-wake type is most commonly associated with neurodegenerative dis-\norders, such as major neurocognitive disorder, and many neurodevelopmental disorders\nin children.Non-24-hour sleep-wake type is most common among blind or visually impaired individ-\nuals who have decreased light perception. In sighted individuals, there is often a history of\ndelayed sleep phase and of decreased exposure to light and structured social and physical\nactivity. Sighted individuals with non-24-hour sleep-wake type also demonstrate in-\ncreased sleep duration.Sleepwalking episodes can include a wide variety of behaviors. Episodes may begin with\nconfusion: the individual may simply sit up in bed, look about, or pick at the blanket or\nsheet. This behavior then becomes progressively complex. The individual may actually\nleave the bed and walk into closets, out of the room, and even out of buildings. Individuals\nmay use the bathroom, eat, talk, or engage in more complex behaviors. Running and fran-\ntic attempts to escape some apparent threat can also occur. Most behaviors during sleep-\nwalking episodes are routine and of low complexity. However, cases of unlocking doors\nand even operating machinery (driving an automobile) have been reported. Sleepwalking\ncan also include inappropriate behavior (e.g., commonly, urinating in a closet or waste-\nbasket). Most episodes last for several minutes to a half hour but may be more protracted.\nInasmuch as sleep is a state of relative analgesia, painful injuries sustained during sleep-\nwalking may not be appreciated until awakening after the fact.\nThere are two “specialized” forms of sleepwalking: sleep-related eating behavior and\nsleep-related sexual behavior (sexsomnia or sleep sex). Individuals with sleep-related eating\nexperience unwanted recurrent episodes of eating with varying degrees of amnesia, rang-\ning from no awareness to full awareness without the ability to not eat. During these epi-\nsodes, inappropriate foods may be ingested. Individuals with sleep-related eating disorder\nmay find evidence of their eating only the next morning. In sexsomnia, varying degrees of\nNon–Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal Disorders\n401\nsexual activity (e.g., masturbation, fondling, groping, sexual intercourse) occur as complex\nbehaviors arising from sleep without conscious awareness. This condition is more common\nin males and may result in serious interpersonal relationship problems or medicolegal\nconsequences.\nDuring a typical episode of sleep terrors, there is often a sense of overwhelming dread,\nwith a compulsion to escape. Although fragmentary vivid dream images may occur, a story-\nlike dream sequence (as in nightmares) is not reported. Most commonly, the individual does\nnot awaken fully, but returns to sleep and has amnesia for the episode on awakening the next\nmorning. Usually only one episode will occur on any one night. Occasionally several episodes\nmay occur at intervals throughout the night. These events rarely arise during daytime naps.Mild autonomic arousal, including sweating, tachycardia, and tachypnea, may character-\nize nightmares. Body movements and vocalizations are not characteristic because of REM\nsleep–related loss of skeletal muscle tone, but such behaviors may occur under situations\nof emotional stress or sleep fragmentation and in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nWhen talking or emoting occurs, it is typically a brief event terminating the nightmare.\nIndividuals with frequent nightmares are at substantially greater risk for suicidal ide-\nation and suicide attempts, even when gender and mental illness are taken into account.Severity determination is best made based on the nature or consequence of the behavior\nrather than simply on frequency. Although the behaviors are typically prominent and vi-\nolent, lesser behaviors may also occur.Periodic leg movements in sleep (PLMS) can serve as corroborating evidence for RLS, with\nup to 90% of individuals diagnosed with RLS demonstrating PLMS when recordings are\ntaken over multiple nights. Periodic leg movements during wakefulness are supportive of\nan RLS diagnosis. Reports of difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep and of excessive\ndaytime sleepiness may also support the diagnosis of RLS. Additional supportive features\ninclude a family history of RLS among first-degree relatives and a reduction in symptoms,\nat least initially, with dopaminergic treatment.During periods of substance/medication use, intoxication, or withdrawal, individuals fre-\nquently complain of dysphoric mood, including depression and anxiety, irritability, cog-\nnitive impairment, inability to concentrate, and fatigue.\nProminent and severe sleep disturbances can occur in association with intoxication\nwith the following classes of substances: alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; opioids; sedatives,\nhypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulants (including cocaine); and other (or unknown) sub-\nstances. Prominent and severe sleep disturbances can occur in association with withdrawal\nfrom the following classes of substances: alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; opioids; sedatives,\nhypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulant (including cocaine); tobacco; and other (or unknown)\nsubstances. Some medications that invoke sleep disturbances include adrenergic agonists\nand antagonists, dopamine agonists and antagonists, cholinergic agonists and antagonists,\nserotonergic agonists and antagonists, antihistamines, and corticosteroids.\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder\n417\nAlcohol.\nAlcohol-induced sleep disorder typically occurs as insomnia type. During\nacute intoxication, alcohol produces an immediate sedative effect depending on dose, ac-\ncompanied by increased stages 3 and 4 non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and re-\nduced rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Following these initial effects, there may be\nincreased wakefulness, restless sleep, and vivid and anxiety-laden dreams for the remain-\ning sleep period. In parallel, stages 3 and 4 sleep are reduced, and wakefulness and REM\nsleep are increased. Alcohol can aggravate breathing-related sleep disorder. With habitual\nuse, alcohol continues to show a short-lived sedative effect in the first half of the night, fol-\nlowed by sleep continuity disruption in the second half. During alcohol withdrawal, there\nis extremely disrupted sleep continuity, and an increased amount and intensity of REM\nsleep, associated frequently with vivid dreaming, which in extreme form, constitutes part\nof alcohol withdrawal delirium. After acute withdrawal, chronic alcohol users may con-\ntinue to complain of light, fragmented sleep for weeks to years associated with a persistent\ndeficit in slow-wave sleep.\nCaffeine.\nCaffeine-induced sleep disorder produces insomnia in a dose-dependent man-\nner, with some individuals presenting with daytime sleepiness related to withdrawal.\nCannabis.\nAcute administration of cannabis may shorten sleep latency, though arous-\ning effects with increments in sleep latency also occur. Cannabis enhances slow-wave\nsleep and suppresses REM sleep after acute administration. In chronic users, tolerance to\nthe sleep-inducing and slow-wave sleep–enhancing effects develops. Upon withdrawal,\nsleep difficulties and unpleasant dreams have been reported lasting for several weeks.\nPolysomnography studies demonstrate reduced slow-wave sleep and increased REM sleep\nduring this phase.\nOpioids.\nOpioids may produce an increase in sleepiness and in subjective depth of sleep,\nand reduced REM sleep, during acute short-term use. With continued administration, tol-\nerance to the sedative effects of opioids develops and there are complaints of insomnia.\nConsistent with their respiratory depressant effects, opioids exacerbate sleep apnea.\nSedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances.\nSedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics (e.g.,\nbarbiturates, benzodiazepines receptor agonists, meprobamate, glutethimide, methypry-\nlon) have similar effects as opioids on sleep. During acute intoxication, sedative-hypnotic\ndrugs produce the expected increase in sleepiness and decrease in wakefulness. Chronic\nuse (particularly of barbiturates and the older nonbarbiturate, nonbenzodiazepine drugs)\nmay cause tolerance with subsequent return of insomnia. Daytime sleepiness may occur.\nSedative-hypnotic drugs can increase the frequency and severity of obstructive sleep ap-\nnea events. Parasomnias are associated with use of benzodiazepine receptor agonists, es-\npecially when these medications are taken at higher doses and when they are combined\nwith other sedative drugs. Abrupt discontinuation of chronic sedative, hypnotic, or anx-\niolytic use can lead to withdrawal but more commonly rebound insomnia, a condition of\nan exacerbation of insomnia upon drug discontinuation for 1–2 days reported to occur\neven with short-term use. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drugs with short durations of\naction are most likely to produce complaints of rebound insomnia, whereas those with\nlonger durations of action are more often associated with daytime sleepiness. Any sedative,\nhypnotic, or anxiolytic drug can potentially cause daytime sedation, withdrawal, or re-\nbound insomnia.\nAmphetamines and related substances and other stimulants.\nSleep disorders induced\nby amphetamine and related substances and other stimulants are characterized by insomnia\nduring intoxication and excessive sleepiness during withdrawal. During acute intoxication,\nstimulants reduce the total amount of sleep, increase sleep latency and sleep continuity distur-\nbances, and decrease REM sleep. Slow-wave sleep tends to be reduced. During withdrawal\nfrom chronic stimulant use, there is both prolonged nocturnal sleep duration and excessive\ndaytime sleepiness. Multiple sleep latency tests may show increased daytime sleepiness dur-\n418\nSleep-Wake Disorders\ning the withdrawal phase. Drugs like 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; “ec-\nstasy”) and related substances lead to restless and disturbed sleep within 48 hours of intake;\nfrequent use of these compounds is associated with persisting symptoms of anxiety, depres-\nsion, and sleep disturbances, even during longer-term abstinence.\nTobacco.\nChronic tobacco consumption is associated primarily with symptoms of insom-\nnia, decreased slow-wave sleep with a reduction of sleep efficiency, and increased daytime\nsleepiness. Withdrawal from tobacco can lead to impaired sleep. Individuals who smoke\nheavily may experience regular nocturnal awakenings caused by tobacco craving.\nOther or unknown substances/medications.\nOther substances/medications may pro-\nduce sleep disturbances, particularly medications that affect the central or autonomic\nnervous systems (e.g., adrenergic agonists and antagonists, dopamine agonists and antag-\nonists, cholinergic agonists and antagonists, serotonergic agonists and antagonists, anti-\nhistamines, corticosteroids).The man and his partner may report prolonged thrusting to achieve orgasm to the point of\nexhaustion or genital discomfort and then ceasing efforts. Some men may report avoiding\nDelayed Ejaculation\n425\nsexual activity because of a repetitive pattern of difficulty ejaculating. Some sexual partners\nmay report feeling less sexually attractive because their partner cannot ejaculate easily.\nIn addition to the subtypes “lifelong/acquired” and “generalized/situational,” the fol-\nlowing five factors must be considered during assessment and diagnosis of delayed ejacu-\nlation, given that they may be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner factors (e.g.,\npartner’s sexual problems, partner’s health status); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor com-\nmunication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors\n(e.g., poor body image; history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g.,\ndepression, anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4) cultural/religious factors\n(e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality);\nand 5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Each of these factors may\ncontribute differently to the presenting symptoms of different men with this disorder.Many men with erectile disorder may have low self-esteem, low self-confidence, and a de-\ncreased sense of masculinity, and may experience depressed affect. Fear and/or avoid-\nance of future sexual encounters may occur. Decreased sexual satisfaction and reduced\nsexual desire in the individual’s partner are common.\nIn addition to the subtypes “lifelong/acquired” and “generalized/situational,” the fol-\nlowing five factors must be considered during assessment and diagnosis of erectile disorder\ngiven that they may be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner factors (e.g., part-\nner’s sexual problems, partner’s health status); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor communi-\ncation, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors (e.g.,\npoor body image, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., de-\npression, anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4) cultural/religious factors (e.g.,\ninhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and\n5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Each of these factors may con-\ntribute differently to the presenting symptoms of different men with this disorder.Associations between specific patterns of personality traits or psychopathology and orgas-\nmic dysfunction have generally not been supported. Compared with women without the\ndisorder, some women with female orgasmic disorder may have greater difficulty com-\nmunicating about sexual issues. Overall sexual satisfaction, however, is not strongly cor-\nrelated with orgasmic experience. Many women report high levels of sexual satisfaction\nFemale Orgasmic Disorder\n431\ndespite rarely or never experiencing orgasm. Orgasmic difficulties in women often co-\noccur with problems related to sexual interest and arousal.\nIn addition to the subtypes “lifelong/acquired” and “generalized/situational,” the fol-\nlowing five factors must be considered during assessment and diagnosis of female orgas-\nmic disorder given that they may be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner\nfactors (e.g., partner’s sexual problems, partner’s health status); 2) relationship factors\n(e.g., poor communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual vul-\nnerability factors (e.g., poor body image, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatricFemale sexual interest/arousal disorder is frequently associated with problems in experi-\nencing orgasm, pain experienced during sexual activity, infrequent sexual activity, and\ncouple-level discrepancies in desire. Relationship difficulties and mood disorders are also\nfrequently associated features of female sexual interest/arousal disorder. Unrealistic ex-\npectations and norms regarding the “appropriate” level of sexual interest or arousal, along\nwith poor sexual techniques and lack of information about sexuality, may also be evident\nin women diagnosed with female sexual interest/arousal disorder. The latter, as well as\nnormative beliefs about gender roles, are important factors to consider.\nIn addition to the subtypes “lifelong/acquired” and “generalized/situational,” the follow-\ning five factors must be considered during assessment and diagnosis of female sexual interest/\narousal disorder given that they may be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner fac-\ntors (e.g., partner’s sexual problems, partner’s health status); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor\ncommunication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors\n(e.g., poor body image, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., de-\npression, anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4) cultural/religious factors (e.g.,\ninhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and\nFemale Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder\n435\n5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Note that each of these factors\nmay contribute differently to the presenting symptoms of different women with this disorder.Genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder is frequently associated with other sexual dysfunc-\ntions, particularly reduced sexual desire and interest (female sexual interest/arousal disor-\nder). Sometimes desire and interest are preserved in sexual situations that are not painful or\ndo not require penetration. Even when individuals with genito-pelvic pain/penetration dis-\norder report sexual interest/motivation, there is often behavioral avoidance of sexual situ-\nations and opportunities. Avoidance of gynecological examinations despite medical\nrecommendations is also frequent. The pattern of avoidance is similar to that seen in phobic\ndisorders. It is common for women who have not succeeded in having sexual intercourse to\ncome for treatment only when they wish to conceive. Many women with genito-pelvic pain/\npenetration disorder will experience associated relationship/marital problems; they also of-\nten report that the symptoms significantly diminish their feelings of femininity.\nIn addition to the subtype “lifelong/acquired,” five factors should be considered dur-\ning assessment and diagnosis of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder because they\nmay be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner factors (e.g., partner’s sexual\nproblems, partner’s health status); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor communication, dis-\ncrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body\nimage, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression,\nanxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4) cultural/religious factors (e.g., inhi-\nbitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and\n5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Each of these factors may\ncontribute differently to the presenting symptoms of different women with this disorder.\nThere are no valid physiological measures of any of the component symptom dimen-\nsions of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder. Validated psychometric inventories may\nbe used to formally assess the pain and anxiety components related to genito-pelvic pain/\npenetration disorder.Male hypoactive sexual desire disorder is sometimes associated with erectile and/or ejac-\nulatory concerns. For example, persistent difficulties obtaining an erection may lead a man\nto lose interest in sexual activity. Men with hypoactive sexual desire disorder often report\nthat they no longer initiate sexual activity and that they are minimally receptive to a part-\nner’s attempt to initiate. Sexual activities (e.g., masturbation or partnered sexual activity)\nmay sometimes occur even in the presence of low sexual desire. Relationship-specific pref-\nerences regarding patterns of sexual initiation must be taken into account when making a\ndiagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Although men are more likely to ini-\ntiate sexual activity, and thus low desire may be characterized by a pattern of non-initiation,\nmany men may prefer to have their partner initiate sexual activity. In such situations, the\nman’s lack of receptivity to a partner’s initiation should be considered when evaluating low\ndesire.\nIn addition to the subtypes “lifelong/acquired” and “generalized/situational,” the fol-\nlowing five factors must be considered during assessment and diagnosis of male hypo-\nactive sexual desire disorder given that they may be relevant to etiology and/or treatment:\n1) partner factors (e.g., partner’s sexual problems, partner’s health status); 2) relationship\nfactors (e.g., poor communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individ-\nual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psy-\nchiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression, anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement);\n4) cultural/religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity;\nattitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treat-\n442\nSexual Dysfunctions\nment. Each of these factors may contribute differently to the presenting symptoms of dif-\nferent men with this disorder.Many males with premature (early) ejaculation complain of a sense of lack of control over\nejaculation and report apprehension about their anticipated inability to delay ejaculation\non future sexual encounters.\nThe following factors may be relevant in the evaluation of any sexual dysfunction:\n1) partner factors (e.g., partner’s sexual problems, partner’s health status); 2) relationship fac-\ntors (e.g., poor communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual\nvulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatricSexual dysfunctions can occur in association with intoxication with the following classes of\nsubstances: alcohol; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulants (including co-\ncaine); and other (or unknown) substances. Sexual dysfunctions can occur in association\nwith withdrawal from the following classes of substances: alcohol; opioids; sedatives, hyp-\nnotics, or anxiolytics; and other (or unknown) substances. Medications that can induce sex-\nual dysfunctions include antidepressants, antipsychotics, and hormonal contraceptives.\nThe most commonly reported side effect of antidepressant drugs is difficulty with or-\ngasm or ejaculation. Problems with desire and erection are less frequent. Approximately\n30% of sexual complaints are clinically significant. Certain agents, such as bupropion and\nmirtazapine, appear not to be associated with sexual side effects.\nThe sexual problems associated with antipsychotic drugs, including problems with\nsexual desire, erection, lubrication, ejaculation, or orgasm, have occurred with typical as\nwell as atypical agents. However, problems are less common with prolactin-sparing anti-\npsychotics than with agents that cause significant prolactin elevation.\nAlthough the effects of mood stabilizers on sexual function are unclear, it is possible\nthat lithium and anticonvulsants, with the possible exception of lamotrigine, have adverse\neffects on sexual desire. Problems with orgasm may occur with gabapentin. Similarly, there\nmay be a higher prevalence of erectile and orgasmic problems associated with benzodiaz-\nepines. There have not been such reports with buspirone.\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction\n449\nMany nonpsychiatric medications, such as cardiovascular, cytotoxic, gastrointestinal,\nand hormonal agents, are associated with disturbances in sexual function. Illicit substance\nuse is associated with decreased sexual desire, erectile dysfunction, and difficulty reach-\ning orgasm. Sexual dysfunctions are also seen in individuals receiving methadone but are\nseldom reported by patients receiving buprenorphine. Chronic alcohol abuse and chronic\nnicotine abuse are associated with erectile problems.When visible signs of puberty develop, natal boys may shave their legs at the first signs of\nhair growth. They sometimes bind their genitals to make erections less visible. Girls may\nbind their breasts, walk with a stoop, or use loose sweaters to make breasts less visible. In-\ncreasingly, adolescents request, or may obtain without medical prescription and supervi-\nsion, hormonal suppressors (“blockers”) of gonadal steroids (e.g., gonadotropin-releasing\nhormone [GnRH] analog, spironolactone). Clinically referred adolescents often want hor-\nmone treatment and many also wish for gender reassignment surgery. Adolescents living in\nan accepting environment may openly express the desire to be and be treated as the experi-\nenced gender and dress partly or completely as the experienced gender, have a hairstyle typ-\nical of the experienced gender, preferentially seek friendships with peers of the other gender,\nand/or adopt a new first name consistent with the experienced gender. Older adolescents,\nwhen sexually active, usually do not show or allow partners to touch their sexual organs. For\nadults with an aversion toward their genitals, sexual activity is constrained by the preference\nthat their genitals not be seen or touched by their partners. Some adults may seek hormone\ntreatment (sometimes without medical prescription and supervision) and gender reassign-\nment surgery. Others are satisfied with either hormone treatment or surgery alone.\nAdolescents and adults with gender dysphoria before gender reassignment are at in-\ncreased risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicides. After gender reassign-\nment, adjustment may vary, and suicide risk may persist.In children and adolescents, oppositional defiant disorder is more prevalent in families in\nwhich child care is disrupted by a succession of different caregivers or in families in which\nharsh, inconsistent, or neglectful child-rearing practices are common. Two of the most\ncommon co-occurring conditions with oppositional defiant disorder are attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder (see the section “Comorbidity” for\nthis disorder). Oppositional defiant disorder has been associated with increased risk for\nsuicide attempts, even after comorbid disorders are controlled for.Mood disorders (unipolar), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders are associated\nwith intermittent explosive disorder, although onset of these disorders is typically later\nthan that of intermittent explosive disorder.Especially in ambiguous situations, aggressive individuals with conduct disorder fre-\nquently misperceive the intentions of others as more hostile and threatening than is the\nConduct Disorder\n473\ncase and respond with aggression that they then feel is reasonable and justified. Person-\nality features of trait negative emotionality and poor self-control, including poor frustra-\ntion tolerance, irritability, temper outbursts, suspiciousness, insensitivity to punishment,\nthrill seeking, and recklessness, frequently co-occur with conduct disorder. Substance\nmisuse is often an associated feature, particularly in adolescent females. Suicidal ideation,\nsuicide attempts, and completed suicide occur at a higher-than-expected rate in individu-\nals with conduct disorder.Individuals with pyromania may make considerable advance preparation for starting a\nfire. They may be indifferent to the consequences to life or property caused by the fire, or\nPyromania\n477\nthey may derive satisfaction from the resulting property destruction. The behaviors may\nlead to property damage, legal consequences, or injury or loss of life to the fire setter or to\nothers. Individuals who impulsively set fires (who may or may not have pyromania) often\nhave a current or past history of alcohol use disorder.Individuals with kleptomania typically attempt to resist the impulse to steal, and they are\naware that the act is wrong and senseless. The individual frequently fears being appre-\nhended and often feels depressed or guilty about the thefts. Neurotransmitter pathways\nassociated with behavioral addictions, including those associated with the serotonin, do-\npamine, and opioid systems, appear to play a role in kleptomania as well.", "prevalence": "The prevalence of specific learning disorder across the academic domains of reading, writ-\ning, and mathematics is 5%–15% among school-age children across different languages\nand cultures. Prevalence in adults is unknown but appears to be approximately 4%.The prevalence of developmental coordination disorder in children ages 5–11 years is 5%–\n6% (in children age 7 years, 1.8% are diagnosed with severe developmental coordination\ndisorder and 3% with probable developmental coordination disorder). Males are more of-\nten affected than females, with a male:female ratio between 2:1 and 7:1.Simple stereotypic movements (e.g., rocking) are common in young typically developing chil-\ndren. Complex stereotypic movements are much less common (occurring in approximately\n3%–4%). Between 4% and 16% of individuals with intellectual disability (intellectual develop-\nmental disorder) engage in stereotypy and self-injury. The risk is greater in individuals with\nsevere intellectual disability. Among individuals with intellectual disability living in res-\nidential facilities, 10%–15% may have stereotypic movement disorder with self-injury.Tics are common in childhood but transient in most cases. The estimated prevalence of\nTourette’s disorder ranges from 3 to 8 per 1,000 in school-age children. Males are more\ncommonly affected than females, with the ratio varying from 2:1 to 4:1. A national survey\nin the United States estimated 3 per 1,000 for the prevalence of clinically identified cases.\nThe frequency of identified cases was lower among African Americans and Hispanic\nAmericans, which may be related to differences in access to care.The lifetime prevalence of delusional disorder has been estimated at around 0.2%, and the\nmost frequent subtype is persecutory. Delusional disorder, jealous type, is probably more\ncommon in males than in females, but there are no major gender differences in the overall\nfrequency of delusional disorder.In the United States, brief psychotic disorder may account for 9% of cases of first-onset\npsychosis. Psychotic disturbances that meet Criteria A and C, but not Criterion B, for brief\npsychotic disorder (i.e., duration of active symptoms is 1–6 months as opposed to remis-\nsion within 1 month) are more common in developing countries than in developed coun-\ntries. Brief psychotic disorder is twofold more common in females than in males.Incidence of schizophreniform disorder across sociocultural settings is likely similar to\nthat observed in schizophrenia. In the United States and other developed countries, the in-\ncidence is low, possibly fivefold less than that of schizophrenia. In developing countries,\nthe incidence may be higher, especially for the specifier “with good prognostic features”;\nin some of these settings schizophreniform disorder may be as common as schizophrenia.The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia appears to be approximately 0.3%–0.7%, al-\nthough there is reported variation by race/ethnicity, across countries, and by geographic\norigin for immigrants and children of immigrants. The sex ratio differs across samples and\npopulations: for example, an emphasis on negative symptoms and longer duration of dis-\norder (associated with poorer outcome) shows higher incidence rates for males, whereas\ndefinitions allowing for the inclusion of more mood symptoms and brief presentations\n(associated with better outcome) show equivalent risks for both sexes.Schizoaffective disorder appears to be about one-third as common as schizophrenia. Life-\ntime prevalence of schizoaffective disorder is estimated to be 0.3%. The incidence of\n108\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\nschizoaffective disorder is higher in females than in males, mainly due to an increased in-\ncidence of the depressive type among females.tion is unknown. Between 7% and 25% of individuals presenting with a first episode of\npsychosis in different settings are reported to have substance/medication-induced psy-\nchotic disorder.\n114\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorderstimate given the wide variety of underlying medical etiologies. Lifetime prevalence has\nPsychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\n117\nbeen estimated to range from 0.21% to 0.54%. When the prevalence findings are stratified\nby age group, individuals older than 65 years have a significantly greater prevalence of\n0.74% compared with those in younger age groups. Rates of psychosis also vary according\nto the underlying medical condition; conditions most commonly associated with psy-\nchosis include untreated endocrine and metabolic disorders, autoimmune disorders (e.g.,\nsystemic lupus erythematosus, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor autoimmune en-\ncephalitis), or temporal lobe epilepsy. Psychosis due to epilepsy has been further differ-\nentiated into ictal, postictal, and interictal psychosis. The most common of these is postictal\npsychosis, observed in 2%–7.8% of epilepsy patients. Among older individuals, there may\nbe a higher prevalence of the disorder in females, although additional gender-related fea-\ntures are not clear and vary considerably with the gender distributions of the underlying\nmedical conditions.The 12-month prevalence estimate in the continental United States was 0.6% for bipolar I\ndisorder as defined in DSM-IV. Twelve-month prevalence of bipolar I disorder across 11\ncountries ranged from 0.0% to 0.6%. The lifetime male-to-female prevalence ratio is ap-\nproximately 1.1:1.The 12-month prevalence of bipolar II disorder, internationally, is 0.3%. In the United\nStates, 12-month prevalence is 0.8%. The prevalence rate of pediatric bipolar II disorder is\ndifficult to establish. DSM-IV bipolar I, bipolar II, and bipolar disorder not otherwise spec-\nified yield a combined prevalence rate of 1.8% in U.S. and non-U.S. community samples,\nwith higher rates (2.7% inclusive) in youths age 12 years or older.The lifetime prevalence of cyclothymic disorder is approximately 0.4%–1%. Prevalence in\nmood disorders clinics may range from 3% to 5%. In the general population, cyclothymic\ndisorder is apparently equally common in males and females. In clinical settings, females\nwith cyclothymic disorder may be more likely to present for treatment than males.There are no epidemiological studies of substance/medication-induced mania or bipolar\ndisorder. Each etiological substance may have its own individual risk of inducing a bipo-\nlar (manic/hypomanic) disorder.Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is common among children presenting to pedi-\natric mental health clinics. Prevalence estimates of the disorder in the community are un-\nclear. Based on rates of chronic and severe persistent irritability, which is the core feature\nof the disorder, the overall 6-month to 1-year period-prevalence of disruptive mood dys-\nregulation disorder among children and adolescents probably falls in the 2%–5% range.\nHowever, rates are expected to be higher in males and school-age children than in females\nand adolescents.Twelve-month prevalence of major depressive disorder in the United States is approximately\n7%, with marked differences by age group such that the prevalence in 18- to 29-year-old indi-\nviduals is threefold higher than the prevalence in individuals age 60 years or older. Females ex-\nperience 1.5- to 3-fold higher rates than males beginning in early adolescence.Persistent depressive disorder is effectively an amalgam of DSM-IV dysthymic disorder and\nchronic major depressive episode. The 12-month prevalence in the United States is approxi-\nmately 0.5% for persistent depressive disorder and 1.5% for chronic major depressive disorder.Twelve-month prevalence of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is between 1.8% and 5.8%\nof menstruating women. Estimates are substantially inflated if they are based on retro-\nspective reports rather than prospective daily ratings. However, estimated prevalence\nbased on a daily record of symptoms for 1–2 months may be less representative, as indi-\nviduals with the most severe symptoms may be unable to sustain the rating process. The\nmost rigorous estimate of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is 1.8% for women whose\nsymptoms meet the full criteria without functional impairment and 1.3% for women\nwhose symptoms meet the current criteria with functional impairment and without co-oc-\ncurring symptoms from another mental disorder.feature of symptom expression during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle, it is\ngenerally considered to be less severe than premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The pres-\nence of physical or behavioral symptoms in the premenstruum, without the required\naffective symptoms, likely meets criteria for premenstrual syndrome and not for premen-\nstrual dysphoric disorder.\nDysmenorrhea.\nDysmenorrhea is a syndrome of painful menses, but this is distinct from a\nsyndrome characterized by affective changes. Moreover, symptoms of dysmenorrhea begin\nwith the onset of menses, whereas symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, by defini-\ntion, begin before the onset of menses, even if they linger into the first few days of menses.\nBipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and persistent depressive disorder\n(dysthymia).\nMany women with (either naturally occurring or substance/medication-\ninduced) bipolar or major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder believe\nthat they have premenstrual dysphoric disorder. However, when they chart symptoms,\nthey realize that the symptoms do not follow a premenstrual pattern. Women with an-\nother mental disorder may experience chronic symptoms or intermittent symptoms that\nare unrelated to menstrual cycle phase. However, because the onset of menses constitutes\na memorable event, they may report that symptoms occur only during the premenstruum\nor that symptoms worsen premenstrually. This is one of the rationales for the requirement\nthat symptoms be confirmed by daily prospective ratings. The process of differential di-\nagnosis, particularly if the clinician relies on retrospective symptoms only, is made more\ndifficult because of the overlap between symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder\nand some other diagnoses. The overlap of symptoms is particularly salient for differenti-\nating premenstrual dysphoric disorder from major depressive episodes, persistent de-\npressive disorder, bipolar disorders, and borderline personality disorder. However, the\nrate of personality disorders is no higher in individuals with premenstrual dysphoric dis-\norder than in those without the disorder.\nUse of hormonal treatments.\nSome women who present with moderate to severe pre-\nmenstrual symptoms may be using hormonal treatments, including hormonal contracep-\ntives. If such symptoms occur after initiation of exogenous hormone use, the symptoms\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder\n175\nmay be due to the use of hormones rather than to the underlying condition of premen-\nstrual dysphoric disorder. If the woman stops hormones and the symptoms disappear,\nthis is consistent with substance/medication-induced depressive disorder.In a nationally representative U.S. adult population, the lifetime prevalence of substance/\nmedication-induced depressive disorder is 0.26%.The 12-month prevalence of separation anxiety disorder among adults in the United States\nis 0.9%–1.9%. In children, 6- to 12-month prevalence is estimated to be approximately 4%.\nIn adolescents in the United States, the 12-month prevalence is 1.6%. Separation anxiety\ndisorder decreases in prevalence from childhood through adolescence and adulthood and\nis the most prevalent anxiety disorder in children younger than 12 years. In clinical sam-\nples of children, the disorder is equally common in males and females. In the community,\nthe disorder is more frequent in females.Selective mutism is a relatively rare disorder and has not been included as a diagnostic cat-\negory in epidemiological studies of prevalence of childhood disorders. Point prevalence\nusing various clinic or school samples ranges between 0.03% and 1% depending on the set-\nting (e.g., clinic vs. school vs. general population) and ages of the individuals in the sample.\nThe prevalence of the disorder does not seem to vary by sex or race/ethnicity. The disor-\nder is more likely to manifest in young children than in adolescents and adults.In the United States, the 12-month community prevalence estimate for specific phobia is\napproximately 7%–9%. Prevalence rates in European countries are largely similar to those\nin the United States (e.g., about 6%), but rates are generally lower in Asian, African, and\nLatin American countries (2%–4%). Prevalence rates are approximately 5% in children and\nare approximately 16% in 13- to 17-year-olds. Prevalence rates are lower in older individ-\nuals (about 3%–5%), possibly reflecting diminishing severity to subclinical levels. Females\nare more frequently affected than males, at a rate of approximately 2:1, although rates vary\nacross different phobic stimuli. That is, animal, natural environment, and situational spe-\ncific phobias are predominantly experienced by females, whereas blood-injection-injury\nphobia is experienced nearly equally by both genders.The 12-month prevalence estimate of social anxiety disorder for the United States is ap-\nproximately 7%. Lower 12-month prevalence estimates are seen in much of the world us-\ning the same diagnostic instrument, clustering around 0.5%–2.0%; median prevalence in\nEurope is 2.3%. The 12-month prevalence rates in children and adolescents are comparable\nto those in adults. Prevalence rates decrease with age. The 12-month prevalence for older\nadults ranges from 2% to 5%. In general, higher rates of social anxiety disorder are found\nin females than in males in the general population (with odds ratios ranging from 1.5 to\n2.2), and the gender difference in prevalence is more pronounced in adolescents and\nyoung adults. Gender rates are equivalent or slightly higher for males in clinical samples,\nand it is assumed that gender roles and social expectations play a significant role in ex-\nplaining the heightened help-seeking behavior in male patients. Prevalence in the United\nStates is higher in American Indians and lower in persons of Asian, Latino, African Amer-\nican, and Afro-Caribbean descent compared with non-Hispanic whites.\nSocial Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)\n205In the general population, the 12-month prevalence estimate for panic disorder across the\nUnited States and several European countries is about 2%–3% in adults and adolescents. In\nthe United States, significantly lower rates of panic disorder are reported among Latinos,\nAfrican Americans, Caribbean blacks, and Asian Americans, compared with non-Latino\nwhites; American Indians, by contrast, have significantly higher rates. Lower estimates\nhave been reported for Asian, African, and Latin American countries, ranging from 0.1%\nto 0.8%. Females are more frequently affected than males, at a rate of approximately 2:1. The\ngender differentiation occurs in adolescence and is already observable before age 14 years.\nAlthough panic attacks occur in children, the overall prevalence of panic disorder is low\nbefore age 14 years (<0.4%). The rates of panic disorder show a gradual increase during ad-\nolescence, particularly in females, and possibly following the onset of puberty, and peak dur-\ning adulthood. The prevalence rates decline in older individuals (i.e., 0.7% in adults over\nthe age of 64), possibly reflecting diminishing severity to subclinical levels.In the general population, 12-month prevalence estimates for panic attacks in the United\nStates is 11.2% in adults. Twelve-month prevalence estimates do not appear to differ sig-\nnificantly among African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos. Lower 12-monthare more frequently affected than males, although this gender difference is more pro-\nnounced for panic disorder. Panic attacks can occur in children but are relatively rare until\nthe age of puberty, when the prevalence rates increase. The prevalence rates decline in\nolder individuals, possibly reflecting diminishing severity to subclinical levels.Every year approximately 1.7% of adolescents and adults have a diagnosis of agoraphobia.\nFemales are twice as likely as males to experience agoraphobia. Agoraphobia may occur in\nchildhood, but incidence peaks in late adolescence and early adulthood. Twelve-monthvary systematically across cultural/racial groups.The 12-month prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder is 0.9% among adolescents and\n2.9% among adults in the general community of the United States. The 12-month preva-\nlence for the disorder in other countries ranges from 0.4% to 3.6%. The lifetime morbid risk\nis 9.0%. Females are twice as likely as males to experience generalized anxiety disorder. TheIndividuals of European descent tend to experience generalized anxiety disorder more\nfrequently than do individuals of non-European descent (i.e., Asian, African, Native\nAmerican and Pacific Islander). Furthermore, individuals from developed countries are\nmore likely than individuals from nondeveloped countries to report that they have expe-\nrienced symptoms that meet criteria for generalized anxiety disorder in their lifetime.ders and unipolar depression, whereas in males, comorbidity is more likely to extend to\nthe substance use disorders as well.The prevalence of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder is not clear. General\npopulation data suggest that it may be rare, with a 12-month prevalence of approximately\n0.002%. However, in clinical populations, the prevalence is likely to be higher.The prevalence of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition is unclear. There ap-\npears to be an elevated prevalence of anxiety disorders among individuals with a variety\nof medical conditions, including asthma, hypertension, ulcers, and arthritis. However, this\nincreased prevalence may be due to reasons other than the anxiety disorder directly caus-\ning the medical condition.The 12-month prevalence of OCD in the United States is 1.2%, with a similar prevalence in-\nternationally (1.1%–1.8%). Females are affected at a slightly higher rate than males in\nadulthood, although males are more commonly affected in childhood.The point prevalence among U.S. adults is 2.4% (2.5% in females and 2.2% in males). Out-\nside the United States (i.e., Germany), current prevalence is approximately 1.7%–1.8%,\nwith a gender distribution similar to that in the United States. The current prevalence is\n9%–15% among dermatology patients, 7%–8% among U.S. cosmetic surgery patients, 3%–\n16% among international cosmetic surgery patients (most studies), 8% among adult orth-\nodontia patients, and 10% among patients presenting for oral or maxillofacial surgery.Nationally representative prevalence studies of hoarding disorder are not available. Com-\nmunity surveys estimate the point prevalence of clinically significant hoarding in the\nUnited States and Europe to be approximately 2%–6%. Hoarding disorder affects both\nmales and females, but some epidemiological studies have reported a significantly greaterfemale. Hoarding symptoms appear to be almost three times more prevalent in older\nadults (ages 55–94 years) compared with younger adults (ages 34–44 years).In the general population, the 12-month prevalence estimate for trichotillomania in adults\nand adolescents is 1%–2%. Females are more frequently affected than males, at a ratio of\napproximately 10:1. This estimate likely reflects the true gender ratio of the condition, al-\nthough it may also reflect differential treatment seeking based on gender or cultural at-\ntitudes regarding appearance (e.g., acceptance of normative hair loss among males).\nAmong children with trichotillomania, males and females are more equally represented.\nTrichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)\n253In the general population, the lifetime prevalence for excoriation disorder in adults is 1.4%\nor somewhat higher. Three-quarters or more of individuals with the disorder are female.\nThis likely reflects the true gender ratio of the condition, although it may also reflect dif-\nferential treatment seeking based on gender or cultural attitudes regarding appearance.In the general population, the very limited data that are available indicate that substance-\ninduced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder is very rare.The prevalence of reactive attachment disorder is unknown, but the disorder is seen rela-\ntively rarely in clinical settings. The disorder has been found in young children exposed to\nsevere neglect before being placed in foster care or raised in institutions. However, even in\npopulations of severely neglected children, the disorder is uncommon, occurring in less\nthan 10% of such children.\nReactive Attachment Disorder\n267The prevalence of disinhibited social attachment disorder is unknown. Nevertheless, the\ndisorder appears to be rare, occurring in a minority of children, even those who have been\nseverely neglected and subsequently placed in foster care or raised in institutions. In such\nhigh-risk populations, the condition occurs in only about 20% of children. The condition is\nseen rarely in other clinical settings.In the United States, projected lifetime risk for PTSD using DSM-IV criteria at age 75 years\nis 8.7%. Twelve-month prevalence among U.S. adults is about 3.5%. Lower estimates are\nseen in Europe and most Asian, African, and Latin American countries, clustering around\n0.5%–1.0%. Although different groups have different levels of exposure to traumatic\nevents, the conditional probability of developing PTSD following a similar level of expo-\nsure may also vary across cultural groups. Rates of PTSD are higher among veterans and\nothers whose vocation increases the risk of traumatic exposure (e.g., police, firefighters,\nemergency medical personnel). Highest rates (ranging from one-third to more than one-\nhalf of those exposed) are found among survivors of rape, military combat and captivity,\nand ethnically or politically motivated internment and genocide. The prevalence of PTSD\nmay vary across development; children and adolescents, including preschool children,\ngenerally have displayed lower prevalence following exposure to serious traumatic\nevents; however, this may be because previous criteria were insufficiently developmen-\ntally informed. The prevalence of full-threshold PTSD also appears to be lower among\nolder adults compared with the general population; there is evidence that subthreshold\npresentations are more common than full PTSD in later life and that these symptoms are\nassociated with substantial clinical impairment. Compared with U.S. non-Latino whites,\nhigher rates of PTSD have been reported among U.S. Latinos, African Americans, and\nAmerican Indians, and lower rates have been reported among Asian Americans, after ad-\njustment for traumatic exposure and demographic variables.The prevalence of acute stress disorder in recently trauma-exposed populations (i.e.,\nwithin 1 month of trauma exposure) varies according to the nature of the event and the\ncontext in which it is assessed. In both U.S. and non-U.S. populations, acute stress disorder\ntends to be identified in less than 20% of cases following traumatic events that do not in-\nvolve interpersonal assault; 13%–21% of motor vehicle accidents, 14% of mild traumatic\nbrain injury, 19% of assault, 10% of severe burns, and 6%–12% of industrial accidents.\nHigher rates (i.e., 20%–50%) are reported following interpersonal traumatic events, in-\ncluding assault, rape, and witnessing a mass shooting.Adjustment disorders are common, although prevalence may vary widely as a function of\nthe population studied and the assessment methods used. The percentage of individuals\nin outpatient mental health treatment with a principal diagnosis of an adjustment disorder\nranges from approximately 5% to 20%. In a hospital psychiatric consultation setting, it is\noften the most common diagnosis, frequently reaching 50%.The 12-month prevalence of dissociative identity disorder among adults in a small U.S.\ncommunity study was 1.5%. The prevalence across genders in that study was 1.6% for\nmales and 1.4% for females.The 12-month prevalence for dissociative amnesia among adults in a small U.S. commu-\nnity study was 1.8% (1.0% for males; 2.6% for females).Transient depersonalization/derealization symptoms lasting hours to days are common\nin the general population. The 12-month prevalence of depersonalization/derealization\ndisorder is thought to be markedly less than for transient symptoms, although precise es-\ntimates for the disorder are unavailable. In general, approximately one-half of all adults\nhave experienced at least one lifetime episode of depersonalization/derealization. How-\never, symptomatology that meets full criteria for depersonalization/derealization disor-\nder is markedly less common than transient symptoms. Lifetime prevalence in U.S. and\nnon-U.S. countries is approximately 2% (range of 0.8% to 2.8%). The gender ratio for the\ndisorder is 1:1.The prevalence of somatic symptom disorder is not known. However, the prevalence of\nsomatic symptom disorder is expected to be higher than that of the more restrictive DSM-\nIV somatization disorder (<1%) but lower than that of undifferentiated somatoform dis-\norder (approximately 19%). The prevalence of somatic symptom disorder in the general\nadult population may be around 5%–7%. Females tend to report more somatic symptoms\nthan do males, and the prevalence of somatic symptom disorder is consequently likely to\nbe higher in females.DSM-IV diagnosis hypochondriasis. The 1- to 2-year prevalence of health anxiety and/or\ndisease conviction in community surveys and population-based samples ranges from 1.3%\nto 10%. In ambulatory medical populations, the 6-month/1-year prevalence rates are be-\ntween 3% and 8%. The prevalence of the disorder is similar in males and females.Transient conversion symptoms are common, but the precise prevalence of the disorder is\nunknown. This is partly because the diagnosis usually requires assessment in secondary\ncare, where it is found in approximately 5% of referrals to neurology clinics. The incidence\nof individual persistent conversion symptoms is estimated to be 2–5/100,000 per year.The prevalence of psychological factors affecting other medical conditions is unclear. In\nU.S. private insurance billing data, it is a more common diagnosis than somatic symptom\ndisorders.The prevalence of factitious disorder is unknown, likely because of the role of deception in\nthis population. Among patients in hospital settings, it is estimated that about 1% of indi-\nviduals have presentations that meet the criteria for factitious disorder.The prevalence of pica is unclear. Among individuals with intellectual disability, the prev-\nalence of pica appears to increase with the severity of the condition.reported to be higher in certain groups, such as individuals with intellectual disability.The 12-month prevalence of anorexia nervosa among young females is approximately\n0.4%. Less is known about prevalence among males, but anorexia nervosa is far less com-\nmon in males than in females, with clinical populations generally reflecting approximately\na 10:1 female-to-male ratio.Twelve-month prevalence of bulimia nervosa among young females is 1%–1.5%. Pointand young adulthood. Less is known about the point prevalence of bulimia nervosa in\nmales, but bulimia nervosa is far less common in males than it is in females, with an ap-\nproximately 10:1 female-to-male ratio.Twelve-month prevalence of binge-eating disorder among U.S. adult (age 18 or older) fe-\nmales and males is 1.6% and 0.8%, respectively. The gender ratio is far less skewed in binge-\neating disorder than in bulimia nervosa. Binge-eating disorder is as prevalent among fe-\nmales from racial or ethnic minority groups as has been reported for white females. The\ndisorder is more prevalent among individuals seeking weight-loss treatment than in the\ngeneral population.\n352\nFeeding and Eating DisordersThe prevalence of enuresis is 5%–10% among 5-year-olds, 3%–5% among 10-year-olds,\nand around 1% among individuals 15 years or older.It is estimated that approximately 1% of 5-year-olds have encopresis, and the disorder is\nmore common in males than in females.Population-based estimates indicate that about one-third of adults report insomnia symp-\ntoms, 10%–15% experience associated daytime impairments, and 6%–10% have symptoms\nInsomnia Disorder\n365\nthat meet criteria for insomnia disorder. Insomnia disorder is the most prevalent of all\nsleep disorders. In primary care settings, approximately 10%–20% of individuals complain\nof significant insomnia symptoms. Insomnia is a more prevalent complaint among fe-\nmales than among males, with a gender ratio of about 1.44:1. Although insomnia can be a\nsymptom or an independent disorder, it is most frequently observed as a comorbid con-\ndition with another medical condition or mental disorder. For instance, 40%–50% of indi-\nviduals with insomnia also present with a comorbid mental disorder.Approximately 5%–10% of individuals who consult in sleep disorders clinics with com-\nplaints of daytime sleepiness are diagnosed as having hypersomnolence disorder. It is es-\ntimated that about 1% of the European and U.S. general population has episodes of sleep\ninertia. Hypersomnolence occurs with relatively equal frequency in males and females.Narcolepsy-cataplexy affects 0.02%–0.04% of the general population in most countries.\nNarcolepsy affects both genders, with possibly a slight male preponderance.Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is a very common disorder, affecting at least 1%–2% of\nchildren, 2%–15% of middle-age adults, and more than 20% of older individuals. In the\ngeneral community, prevalence rates of undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea\nmay be very high in elderly individuals. Since the disorder is strongly associated with obe-\nsity, increases in obesity rates are likely to be accompanied by an increased prevalence of\nthis disorder. Prevalence may be particularly high among males, older adults, and certain\nracial/ethnic groups. In adults, the male-to-female ratio of obstructive sleep apnea hypop-\nnea ranges from 2:1 to 4:1. Gender differences decline in older age, possibly because of an\nincreased prevalence in females after menopause. There is no gender difference among\nprepubertal children.The prevalence of idiopathic central sleep apnea is unknown but thought to be rare. Thetricular ejection fraction. In individuals with an ejection fraction of less than 45%, the prev-\nalence has been reported to be 20% or higher. The male-to-female ratio for prevalence is\neven more highly skewed toward males than for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Prev-\nalence increases with age, and most patients are older than 60 years. Cheyne-Stokes breath-\ning occurs in approximately 20% of individuals with acute stroke. Central sleep apnea\ncomorbid with opioid use occurs in approximately 30% of individuals taking chronic opi-\noids for nonmalignant pain and similarly in individuals receiving methadone mainte-\nnance therapy.Idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation in adults is very uncommon. The prevalence of\ncongenital central alveolar hypoventilation is unknown, but the disorder is rare. Comor-\nbid sleep-related hypoventilation (i.e., hypoventilation comorbid with other conditions,\nsuch as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], neuromuscular disorders, or obe-\nsity) is more common.but appears to be greater than 7% in adolescents. Although the prevalence of familial de-\nlayed sleep phase type has not been established, a family history of delayed sleep phase is\npresent in individuals with delayed sleep phase type.The estimated prevalence of advanced sleep phase type is approximately 1% in middle-\nage adults. Sleep-wake times and circadian phase advance in older individuals, probably\naccounting for increased prevalence in this population.disorder appears rare in sighted individuals. The prevalence in blind individuals is esti-\nmated to be 50%.The prevalence of shift work type is unclear, but the disorder is estimated to affect 5%–10%\nof the night worker population (16%–20% of the workforce). Prevalence rises with advance-\nment into middle-age and beyond (Drake et al. 2004).\n398\nSleep-Wake DisordersIsolated or infrequent NREM sleep arousal disorders are very common in the general pop-\nulation. From 10% to 30% of children have had at least one episode of sleepwalking, and\n2%–3% sleepwalk often. The prevalence of sleepwalking disorder, marked by repeated ep-\nisodes and impairment or distress, is much lower, probably in the range of 1%–5%. Theadults, with weekly to monthly episodes occurring in 0.5%–0.7%. The lifetime prevalence\nof sleepwalking in adults is 29.2%, with a past-year prevalence of sleepwalking of 3.6%.\nThe prevalence of sleep terrors in the general population is unknown. The prevalence\nof sleep terror episodes (as opposed to sleep terror disorder, in which there is recurrence\nand distress or impairment) is approximately 36.9% at 18 months of age, 19.7% at 30 months\nof age, and 2.2% in adults.3.9% of parents report that their preschool children have nightmares “often” or “always”.crease to ages 20–29 for females (while decreasing for males), when it can be twice as high\nfor females as for males. Prevalence decreases steadily with age for both sexes, but the gen-\nder difference remains. Among adults, prevalence of nightmares at least monthly is 6%,\nwhereas prevalence for frequent nightmares is 1%–2%. Estimates often combine idio-\npathic and posttraumatic nightmares indiscriminately.The prevalence of REM sleep behavior disorder is approximately 0.38%–0.5% in the gen-\neral population. Prevalence in patients with psychiatric disorders may be greater, possibly\nrelated to medications prescribed for the psychiatric disorder.7.2% when more defined criteria are employed. When frequency of symptoms is at least\nthree times per week with moderate or severe distress, the prevalence rate is 1.6%; when\nfrequency of symptoms is a minimum of one time per week, the prevalence rate is 4.5%.\nFemales are 1.5–2 times more likely than males to have RLS. RLS also increases with age.\nThe prevalence of RLS may be lower in Asian populations.remaining stable or decreasing slightly in older age groups. Compared with nonfamilial\ncases, familial RLS usually has a younger age at onset and a slower progressive course. The\nclinical course of RLS differs by age at onset. When onset occurs before age 45, there is of-\nten a slow progression of symptoms. In late-onset RLS, rapid progression is typical, and\naggravating factors are common. Symptoms of RLS appear similar across the lifespan, re-\nmaining stable or decreasing slightly in older age groups.\nDiagnosis of RLS in children can be difficult because of the self-report component.\nWhile Criterion A for adults assumes that the description of “urge to move” is by the pa-\ntient, pediatric diagnosis requires a description in the child’s own words rather than by a\nparent or caretaker. Typically children age 6 years or older are able to provide detailed, ad-\nequate descriptors of RLS. However, children rarely use or understand the word “urge,”\nreporting instead that their legs “have to” or “got to” move. Also, potentially related to\nprolonged periods of sitting during class, two-thirds of children and adolescents report\ndaytime leg sensations. Thus, for diagnostic Criterion A3, it is important to compare equal\n412\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nduration of sitting or lying down in the day to sitting or lying down in the evening or night.\nNocturnal worsening tends to persist even in the context of pediatric RLS. As with RLS in\nadults, there is a significant negative impact on sleep, mood, cognition, and function. Im-\npairment in children and adolescents is manifested more often in behavioral and educa-\ntional domains.least common male sexual complaint. Only 75% of men report always ejaculating during\nsexual activity, and less than 1% of men will complain of problems with reaching ejacula-\ntion that last more than 6 months.The prevalence of lifelong versus acquired erectile disorder is unknown. There is a strong\nage-related increase in both prevalence and incidence of problems with erection, particu-\nlarly after age 50 years. Approximately 13%–21% of men ages 40–80 years complain of oc-\ncasional problems with erections. Approximately 2% of men younger than age 40–50 years\ncomplain of frequent problems with erections, whereas 40%–50% of men older than 60–70\nyears may have significant problems with erections. About 20% of men fear erectile prob-\nlems on their first sexual experience, whereas approximately 8% experienced erectile prob-\nlems that hindered penetration during their first sexual experience.Reported prevalence rates for female orgasmic problems in women vary widely, from 10%\nto 42%, depending on multiple factors (e.g., age, culture, duration, and severity of symp-\ntoms); however, these estimates do not take into account the presence of distress. Only a\nproportion of women experiencing orgasm difficulties also report associated distress.\nVariation in how symptoms are assessed (e.g., the duration of symptoms and the recall pe-\nriod) also influence prevalence rates. Approximately 10% of women do not experience or-\ngasm throughout their lifetime.The prevalence of female sexual interest/arousal disorder, as defined in this manual, is\nunknown. The prevalence of low sexual desire and of problems with sexual arousal (with\nand without associated distress), as defined by DSM-IV or ICD-10, may vary markedly in\nrelation to age, cultural setting, duration of symptoms, and presence of distress. Regard-\ning duration of symptoms, there are striking differences in prevalence estimates between\nshort-term and persistent problems related to lack of sexual interest. When distress about\nsexual functioning is required, prevalence estimates are markedly lower. Some older\nwomen report less distress about low sexual desire than younger women, although sexual\ndesire may decrease with age.The prevalence of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder is unknown. However, approx-\nimately 15% of women in North America report recurrent pain during intercourse. Diffi-\nculties having intercourse appear to be a frequent referral to sexual dysfunction clinics and\nto specialist clinicians.\nGenito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder\n439The prevalence of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder varies depending on country of\norigin and method of assessment. Approximately 6% of younger men (ages 18–24 years)\nand 41% of older men (ages 66–74 years) have problems with sexual desire. However, a\npersistent lack of interest in sex, lasting 6 months or more, affects only a small proportion\nof men ages 16–44 (1.8%).Estimates of the prevalence of premature (early) ejaculation vary widely depending on the\ndefinition utilized. Internationally, more than 20%–30% of men ages 18–70 years report\nconcern about how rapidly they ejaculate. With the new definition of premature (early)\nejaculation (i.e., ejaculation occurring within approximately 1 minute of vaginal penetra-\ntion), only 1%–3% of men would be diagnosed with the disorder. Prevalence of premature\n(early) ejaculation may increase with age.The prevalence and the incidence of substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction\nare unclear, likely because of underreporting of treatment-emergent sexual side effects.\nData on substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction typically concern the effects of\nantidepressant drugs. The prevalence of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction var-\nies in part depending on the specific agent. Approximately 25%–80% of individuals taking\nmonoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonergic antidepressants,\nand combined serotonergic-adrenergic antidepressants report sexual side effects. There\nare differences in the incidence of sexual side effects between some serotonergic and com-\nbined adrenergic-serotonergic antidepressants, although it is unclear if these differences\nare clinically significant.\nApproximately 50% of individuals taking antipsychotic medications will experience\nadverse sexual side effects, including problems with sexual desire, erection, lubrication,\nejaculation, or orgasm. The incidence of these side effects among different antipsychotic\nagents is unclear.\nExact prevalence and incidence of sexual dysfunctions among users of nonpsychiatric\nmedications such as cardiovascular, cytotoxic, gastrointestinal, and hormonal agents are\nunknown. Elevated rates of sexual dysfunction have been reported with methadone or\nhigh-dose opioid drugs for pain. There are increased rates of decreased sexual desire, erec-\ntile dysfunction, and difficulty reaching orgasm associated with illicit substance use. Thein individuals who abuse heroin (approximately 60%–70%) than in individuals who abuse\namphetamines or 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (i.e., MDMA, ecstasy). Elevated\nrates of sexual dysfunction are also seen in individuals receiving methadone but are sel-\ndom reported by patients receiving buprenorphine. Chronic alcohol abuse and chronic\nnicotine abuse are related to higher rates of erectile problems.For natal adult males, prevalence ranges from 0.005% to 0.014%, and for natal females,\nfrom 0.002% to 0.003%. Since not all adults seeking hormone treatment and surgical reas-\nsignment attend specialty clinics, these rates are likely modest underestimates. Sex differ-\nences in rate of referrals to specialty clinics vary by age group. In children, sex ratios of\nnatal boys to girls range from 2:1 to 4.5:1. In adolescents, the sex ratio is close to parity; in\nadults, the sex ratio favors natal males, with ratios ranging from 1:1 to 6.1:1. In two coun-\ntries, the sex ratio appears to favor natal females (Japan: 2.2:1; Poland: 3.4:1).The prevalence of oppositional defiant disorder ranges from 1% to 11%, with an averagedepending on the age and gender of the child. The disorder appears to be somewhat more\nprevalent in males than in females (1.4:1) prior to adolescence. This male predominance is\nnot consistently found in samples of adolescents or adults.One-year prevalence data for intermittent explosive disorder in the United States is about\n2.7% (narrow definition). Intermittent explosive disorder is more prevalent among\nyounger individuals (e.g., younger than 35–40 years), compared with older individuals\n(older than 50 years), and in individuals with a high school education or less.One-year population prevalence estimates range from 2% to more than 10%, with a median\nof 4%. The prevalence of conduct disorder appears to be fairly consistent across various\ncountries that differ in race and ethnicity. Prevalence rates rise from childhood to adoles-\ncence and are higher among males than among females. Few children with impairing con-\nduct disorder receive treatment.The population prevalence of pyromania is not known. The lifetime prevalence of fire set-\nting, which is just one component of pyromania and not sufficient for a diagnosis by itself,\nwas reported as 1.13% in a population sample, but the most common comorbidities were\nantisocial personality disorder, substance use disorder, bipolar disorder, and pathological\ngambling (gambling disorder). In contrast, pyromania as a primary diagnosis appears to\nbe very rare. Among a sample of persons reaching the criminal system with repeated fire\nsetting, only 3.3% had symptoms that met full criteria for pyromania.Kleptomania occurs in about 4%–24% of individuals arrested for shoplifting. Its preva-\nlence in the general population is very rare, at approximately 0.3%–0.6%. Females outnum-\nber males at a ratio of 3:1.", "development_course": "Onset, recognition, and diagnosis of specific learning disorder usually occurs during the\nelementary school years when children are required to learn to read, spell, write, and learn\nSpecific Learning Disorder\n71\nmathematics. However, precursors such as language delays or deficits, difficulties in\nrhyming or counting, or difficulties with fine motor skills required for writing commonly\noccur in early childhood before the start of formal schooling. Manifestations may be be-\nhavioral (e.g., a reluctance to engage in learning; oppositional behavior). Specific learning\ndisorder is lifelong, but the course and clinical expression are variable, in part depending\non the interactions among the task demands of the environment, the range and severity of\nthe individual’s learning difficulties, the individual’s learning abilities, comorbidity, and\nthe available support systems and intervention. Nonetheless, problems with reading flu-\nency and comprehension, spelling, written expression, and numeracy skills in everyday life\ntypically persist into adulthood.\nChanges in manifestation of symptoms occur with age, so that an individual may have\na persistent or shifting array of learning difficulties across the lifespan.\nExamples of symptoms that may be observed among preschool-age children include a lack\nof interest in playing games with language sounds (e.g., repetition, rhyming), and they may\nhave trouble learning nursery rhymes. Preschool children with specific learning disorder may\nfrequently use baby talk, mispronounce words, and have trouble remembering names of let-\nters, numbers, or days of the week. They may fail to recognize letters in their own names and\nhave trouble learning to count. Kindergarten-age children with specific learning disorder may\nbe unable to recognize and write letters, may be unable to write their own names, or may use\ninvented spelling. They may have trouble breaking down spoken words into syllables (e.g.,\n“cowboy” into “cow” and “boy”) and trouble recognizing words that rhyme (e.g., cat, bat, hat).\nKindergarten-age children also may have trouble connecting letters with their sounds (e.g., let-\nter b makes the sound /b/) and may be unable to recognize phonemes (e.g., do not know\nwhich in a set of words [e.g., dog, man, car] starts with the same sound as “cat”).\nSpecific learning disorder in elementary school–age children typically manifests as\nmarked difficulty learning letter-sound correspondence (particularly in English-speaking\nchildren), fluent word decoding, spelling, or math facts; reading aloud is slow, inaccurate,\nand effortful, and some children struggle to understand the magnitude that a spoken or\nwritten number represents. Children in primary grades (grades 1–3) may continue to have\nproblems recognizing and manipulating phonemes, be unable to read common one-sylla-\nble words (such as mat or top), and be unable recognize common irregularly spelled\nwords (e.g., said, two). They may commit reading errors that indicate problems in con-\nnecting sounds and letters (e.g., “big” for “got”) and have difficulty sequencing numbers\nand letters. Children in grades 1-3 also may have difficulty remembering number facts or\narithmetic procedures for adding, subtracting, and so forth, and may complain that read-\ning or arithmetic is hard and avoid doing it. Children with specific learning disorder in the\nmiddle grades (grades 4–6) may mispronounce or skip parts of long, multisyllable words\n(e.g., say “conible” for “convertible,” “aminal” for “animal”) and confuse words that\nsound alike (e.g., “tornado” for “volcano”). They may have trouble remembering dates,\nnames, and telephone numbers and may have trouble completing homework or tests on\ntime. Children in the middle grades also may have poor comprehension with or without\nslow, effortful, and inaccurate reading, and they may have trouble reading small function\nwords (e.g., that, the, an, in). They may have very poor spelling and poor written work.\nThey may get the first part of a word correctly, then guess wildly (e.g., read “clover” as\n“clock”), and may express fear of reading aloud or refuse to read aloud.\nBy contrast, adolescents may have mastered word decoding, but reading remains slow\nand effortful, and they are likely to show marked problems in reading comprehension and\nwritten expression (including poor spelling) and poor mastery of math facts or mathemat-\nical problem solving. During adolescence and into adulthood, individuals with specific\nlearning disorder may continue to make numerous spelling mistakes and read single\nwords and connected text slowly and with much effort, with trouble pronouncing multi-\nsyllable words. They may frequently need to reread material to understand or get the main\npoint and have trouble making inferences from written text. Adolescents and adults may\n72\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\navoid activities that demand reading or arithmetic (reading for pleasure, reading instruc-\ntions). Adults with specific learning disorder have ongoing spelling problems, slow and\neffortful reading, or problems making important inferences from numerical information\nin work-related written documents. They may avoid both leisure and work-related activ-\nities that demand reading or writing or use alternative approaches to access print (e.g.,\ntext-to-speech/speech-to-text software, audiobooks, audiovisual media).\nAn alternative clinical expression is that of circumscribed learning difficulties that per-\nsist across the lifespan, such as an inability to master the basic sense of number (e.g., to\nknow which of a pair of numbers or dots represents the larger magnitude), or lack of pro-\nficiency in word identification or spelling. Avoidance of or reluctance to engage in activi-\nties requiring academic skills is common in children, adolescents, and adults. Episodes of\nsevere anxiety or anxiety disorders, including somatic complaints or panic attacks, are\ncommon across the lifespan and accompany both the circumscribed and the broader ex-\npression of learning difficulties.The course of developmental coordination disorder is variable but stable at least to 1 year\nfollow-up. Although there may be improvement in the longer term, problems with coor-\n76\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\ndinated movements continue through adolescence in an estimated 50%–70% of children.\nOnset is in early childhood. Delayed motor milestones may be the first signs, or the disor-\nder is first recognized when the child attempts tasks such as holding a knife and fork, but-\ntoning clothes, or playing ball games. In middle childhood, there are difficulties with\nmotor aspects of assembling puzzles, building models, playing ball, and handwriting, as\nwell as with organizing belongings, when motor sequencing and coordination are re-\nquired. In early adulthood, there is continuing difficulty in learning new tasks involving\ncomplex/automatic motor skills, including driving and using tools. Inability to take notes\nand handwrite quickly may affect performance in the workplace. Co-occurrence with\nother disorders (see the section “Comorbidity” for this disorder) has an additional impact\non presentation, course, and outcome.Stereotypic movements typically begin within the first 3 years of life. Simple stereotypic move-\nments are common in infancy and may be involved in acquisition of motor mastery. In chil-\ndren who develop complex motor stereotypies, approximately 80% exhibit symptoms before\n24 months of age, 12% between 24 and 35 months, and 8% at 36 months or older. In most typ-\nically developing children, these movements resolve over time or can be suppressed. Onset of\ncomplex motor stereotypies may be in infancy or later in the developmental period. Among\nindividuals with intellectual disability, the stereotyped, self-injurious behaviors may persist\nfor years, even though the typography or pattern of self-injury may change.Onset of tics is typically between ages 4 and 6 years. Peak severity occurs between ages 10\nand 12 years, with a decline in severity during adolescence. Many adults with tic disorders\nexperience diminished symptoms. A small percentage of individuals will have persis-\ntently severe or worsening symptoms in adulthood.\nTic symptoms manifest similarly in all age groups and across the lifespan. Tics wax and\nwane in severity and change in affected muscle groups and vocalizations over time. As\nchildren get older, they begin to report their tics being associated with a premonitory\nurge—a somatic sensation that precedes the tic—and a feeling of tension reduction follow-\ning the expression of the tic. Tics associated with a premonitory urge may be experienced\nas not completely “involuntary” in that the urge and the tic can be resisted. An individual\nmay also feel the need to perform a tic in a specific way or repeat it until he or she achieves\nthe feeling that the tic has been done “just right.”\nThe vulnerability toward developing co-occurring conditions changes as individuals\npass through the age of risk for various co-occurring conditions. For example, prepubertal\nchildren with tic disorders are more likely to experience attention-deficit/hyperactivity\ndisorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and separation anxiety disorder\nthan are teenagers and adults, who are more likely to experience the new onset of major\ndepressive disorder, substance use disorder, or bipolar disorder.On average, global function is generally better than that observed in schizophrenia. Al-\nthough the diagnosis is generally stable, a proportion of individuals go on to develop\nDelusional Disorder\n93\nschizophrenia. Delusional disorder has a significant familial relationship with both\nschizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder. Although it can occur in younger age\ngroups, the condition may be more prevalent in older individuals.Brief psychotic disorder may appear in adolescence or early adulthood, and onset can oc-\ncur across the lifespan, with the average age at onset being the mid 30s. By definition, a\ndiagnosis of brief psychotic disorder requires a full remission of all symptoms and an\neventual full return to the premorbid level of functioning within 1 month of the onset of the\ndisturbance. In some individuals, the duration of psychotic symptoms may be quite brief\n(e.g., a few days).The development of schizophreniform disorder is similar to that of schizophrenia. About\none-third of individuals with an initial diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder (provi-\nsional) recover within the 6-month period and schizophreniform disorder is their final di-\nagnosis. The majority of the remaining two-thirds of individuals will eventually receive a\ndiagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.The psychotic features of schizophrenia typically emerge between the late teens and the\nmid-30s; onset prior to adolescence is rare. The peak age at onset for the first psychotic ep-\nisode is in the early- to mid-20s for males and in the late-20s for females. The onset may be\nabrupt or insidious, but the majority of individuals manifest a slow and gradual develop-\nment of a variety of clinically significant signs and symptoms. Half of these individuals\ncomplain of depressive symptoms. Earlier age at onset has traditionally been seen as a pre-\ndictor of worse prognosis. However, the effect of age at onset is likely related to gender,\nwith males having worse premorbid adjustment, lower educational achievement, more\nprominent negative symptoms and cognitive impairment, and in general a worse out-\ncome. Impaired cognition is common, and alterations in cognition are present during de-\nvelopment and precede the emergence of psychosis, taking the form of stable cognitive\nimpairments during adulthood. Cognitive impairments may persist when other symptoms\nare in remission and contribute to the disability of the disease.\nThe predictors of course and outcome are largely unexplained, and course and outcome\nmay not be reliably predicted. The course appears to be favorable in about 20% of those\nwith schizophrenia, and a small number of individuals are reported to recover completely.\nHowever, most individuals with schizophrenia still require formal or informal daily living\nsupports, and many remain chronically ill, with exacerbations and remissions of active\nsymptoms, while others have a course of progressive deterioration.\nPsychotic symptoms tend to diminish over the life course, perhaps in association with\nnormal age-related declines in dopamine activity. Negative symptoms are more closely re-\nlated to prognosis than are positive symptoms and tend to be the most persistent. Further-\nmore, cognitive deficits associated with the illness may not improve over the course of the\nillness.\nThe essential features of schizophrenia are the same in childhood, but it is more diffi-\ncult to make the diagnosis. In children, delusions and hallucinations may be less elaborate\nthan in adults, and visual hallucinations are more common and should be distinguished\nfrom normal fantasy play. Disorganized speech occurs in many disorders with childhood\nonset (e.g., autism spectrum disorder), as does disorganized behavior (e.g., attention-deficit/\nSchizophrenia\n103\nhyperactivity disorder). These symptoms should not be attributed to schizophrenia with-\nout due consideration of the more common disorders of childhood. Childhood-onset cases\ntend to resemble poor-outcome adult cases, with gradual onset and prominent negative\nsymptoms. Children who later receive the diagnosis of schizophrenia are more likely to\nhave experienced nonspecific emotional-behavioral disturbances and psychopathology,\nintellectual and language alterations, and subtle motor delays.\nLate-onset cases (i.e., onset after age 40 years) are overrepresented by females, who\nmay have married. Often, the course is characterized by a predominance of psychotic\nsymptoms with preservation of affect and social functioning. Such late-onset cases can still\nmeet the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, but it is not yet clear whether this is the\nsame condition as schizophrenia diagnosed prior to mid-life (e.g., prior to age 55 years).The typical age at onset of schizoaffective disorder is early adulthood, although onset can\noccur anywhere from adolescence to late in life. A significant number of individuals diag-\nnosed with another psychotic illness initially will receive the diagnosis schizoaffective dis-\norder later when the pattern of mood episodes has become more apparent. With the\ncurrent diagnostic Criterion C, it is expected that the diagnosis for some individuals will\nconvert from schizoaffective disorder to another disorder as mood symptoms become less\nprominent. The prognosis for schizoaffective disorder is somewhat better than the prog-\nnosis for schizophrenia but worse than the prognosis for mood disorders.\nSchizoaffective disorder may occur in a variety of temporal patterns. The following is\na typical pattern: An individual may have pronounced auditory hallucinations and per-\nsecutory delusions for 2 months before the onset of a prominent major depressive episode.\nThe psychotic symptoms and the full major depressive episode are then present for 3 months.\nThen, the individual recovers completely from the major depressive episode, but the psy-\nchotic symptoms persist for another month before they too disappear. During this period\nof illness, the individual’s symptoms concurrently met criteria for a major depressive ep-\nisode and Criterion A for schizophrenia, and during this same period of illness, auditory\nhallucinations and delusions were present both before and after the depressive phase. The\ntotal period of illness lasted for about 6 months, with psychotic symptoms alone present\nduring the initial 2 months, both depressive and psychotic symptoms present during the\nnext 3 months, and psychotic symptoms alone present during the last month. In this in-\nstance, the duration of the depressive episode was not brief relative to the total duration of\nthe psychotic disturbance, and thus the presentation qualifies for a diagnosis of schizoaf-\nfective disorder.\nThe expression of psychotic symptoms across the lifespan is variable. Depressive or\nmanic symptoms can occur before the onset of psychosis, during acute psychotic episodes,\nduring residual periods, and after cessation of psychosis. For example, an individual\nmight present with prominent mood symptoms during the prodromal stage of schizo-\nphrenia. This pattern is not necessarily indicative of schizoaffective disorder, since it is the\nco-occurrence of psychotic and mood symptoms that is diagnostic. For an individual with\nsymptoms that clearly meet the criteria for schizoaffective disorder but who on further fol-\nlow-up only presents with residual psychotic symptoms (such as subthreshold psychosis\nand/or prominent negative symptoms), the diagnosis may be changed to schizophrenia,\nas the total proportion of psychotic illness compared with mood symptoms becomes more\nprominent. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, may be more common in young adults,\nwhereas schizoaffective disorder, depressive type, may be more common in older adults.The initiation of the disorder may vary considerably with the substance. For example,\nsmoking a high dose of cocaine may produce psychosis within minutes, whereas days or\nweeks of high-dose alcohol or sedative use may be required to produce psychosis. Alco-\nhol-induced psychotic disorder, with hallucinations, usually occurs only after prolonged,\nheavy ingestion of alcohol in individuals who have moderate to severe alcohol use disorder,\nand the hallucinations are generally auditory in nature.\nPsychotic disorders induced by amphetamine and cocaine share similar clinical fea-\ntures. Persecutory delusions may rapidly develop shortly after use of amphetamine or a\nsimilarly acting sympathomimetic. The hallucination of bugs or vermin crawling in or un-\nder the skin (formication) can lead to scratching and extensive skin excoriations. Cannabis-\ninduced psychotic disorder may develop shortly after high-dose cannabis use and usually\ninvolves persecutory delusions, marked anxiety, emotional lability, and depersonalization.\nThe disorder usually remits within a day but in some cases may persist for a few days.\nSubstance/medication-induced psychotic disorder may at times persist when the offend-\ning agent is removed, such that it may be difficult initially to distinguish it from an indepen-\ndent psychotic disorder. Agents such as amphetamines, phencyclidine, and cocaine have been\nreported to evoke temporary psychotic states that can sometimes persist for weeks or longer\ndespite removal of the agent and treatment with neuroleptic medication. In later life, poly-\npharmacy for medical conditions and exposure to medications for parkinsonism, cardiovas-\ncular disease, and other medical disorders may be associated with a greater likelihood of\npsychosis induced by prescription medications as opposed to substances of abuse.Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition may be a single transient state or it\nmay be recurrent, cycling with exacerbations and remissions of the underlying medical\ncondition. Although treatment of the underlying medical condition often results in a res-\nolution of the psychosis, this is not always the case, and psychotic symptoms may persist\nlong after the medical event (e.g., psychotic disorder due to focal brain injury). In the con-\ntext of chronic conditions such as multiple sclerosis or chronic interictal psychosis of epi-\nlepsy, the psychosis may assume a long-term course.\nThe expression of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition does not differ\nsubstantially in phenomenology depending on age at occurrence. However, older age\ngroups have a higher prevalence of the disorder, which is most likely due to the increasing\nmedical burden associated with advanced age and the cumulative effects of deleterious\nexposures and age-related processes (e.g., atherosclerosis). The nature of the underlying\nmedical conditions is likely to change across the lifespan, with younger age groups more\naffected by epilepsy, head trauma, autoimmune, and neoplastic diseases of early to mid-\nlife, and older age groups more affected by stroke disease, anoxic events, and multiple sys-\ntem comorbidities. Underlying factors with increasing age, such as preexisting cognitive\nimpairment as well as vision and hearing impairments, may incur a greater risk for psy-\nchosis, possibly by serving to lower the threshold for experiencing psychosis.Mean age at onset of the first manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode is approxi-\nmately 18 years for bipolar I disorder. Special considerations are necessary to detect the di-\nagnosis in children. Since children of the same chronological age may be at different\ndevelopmental stages, it is difficult to define with precision what is “normal” or “ex-\npected” at any given point. Therefore, each child should be judged according to his or her\nown baseline. Onset occurs throughout the life cycle, including first onsets in the 60s or\n70s. Onset of manic symptoms (e.g., sexual or social disinhibition) in late mid-life or late-\nlife should prompt consideration of medical conditions (e.g., frontotemporal neurocogni-\ntive disorder) and of substance ingestion or withdrawal.\nMore than 90% of individuals who have a single manic episode go on to have recurrent\nmood episodes. Approximately 60% of manic episodes occur immediately before a major\ndepressive episode. Individuals with bipolar I disorder who have multiple (four or more)\nmood episodes (major depressive, manic, or hypomanic) within 1 year receive the speci-\nfier “with rapid cycling.”Although bipolar II disorder can begin in late adolescence and throughout adulthood, av-\nerage age at onset is the mid-20s, which is slightly later than for bipolar I disorder but ear-\nlier than for major depressive disorder. The illness most often begins with a depressive\nepisode and is not recognized as bipolar II disorder until a hypomanic episode occurs; this\nhappens in about 12% of individuals with the initial diagnosis of major depressive disor-\nder. Anxiety, substance use, or eating disorders may also precede the diagnosis, compli-\ncating its detection. Many individuals experience several episodes of major depression\nprior to the first recognized hypomanic episode.\nThe number of lifetime episodes (both hypomanic and major depressive episodes)\ntends to be higher for bipolar II disorder than for major depressive disorder or bipolar I\ndisorder. However, individuals with bipolar I disorder are actually more likely to experi-\nence hypomanic symptoms than are individuals with bipolar II disorder.The interval\nbetween mood episodes in the course of bipolar II disorder tends to decrease as the indi-\nvidual ages. While the hypomanic episode is the feature that defines bipolar II disorder,\ndepressive episodes are more enduring and disabling over time. Despite the predomi-\nnance of depression, once a hypomanic episode has occurred, the diagnosis becomes bi-\npolar II disorder and never reverts to major depressive disorder.\nApproximately 5%–15% of individuals with bipolar II disorder have multiple (four or\nmore) mood episodes (hypomanic or major depressive) within the previous 12 months. If\nBipolar II Disorder\n137\nthis pattern is present, it is noted by the specifier “with rapid cycling.” By definition, psy-\nchotic symptoms do not occur in hypomanic episodes, and they appear to be less frequent\nin the major depressive episodes in bipolar II disorder than in those of bipolar I disorder.\nSwitching from a depressive episode to a manic or hypomanic episode (with or with-\nout mixed features) may occur, both spontaneously and during treatment for depression.\nAbout 5%–15% of individuals with bipolar II disorder will ultimately develop a manic ep-\nisode, which changes the diagnosis to bipolar I disorder, regardless of subsequent course.\nMaking the diagnosis in children is often a challenge, especially in those with irritabil-\nity and hyperarousal that is nonepisodic (i.e., lacks the well-demarcated periods of altered\nmood). Nonepisodic irritability in youth is associated with an elevated risk for anxiety dis-\norders and major depressive disorder, but not bipolar disorder, in adulthood. Persistently\nirritable youths have lower familial rates of bipolar disorder than do youths who have bi-\npolar disorder. For a hypomanic episode to be diagnosed, the child’s symptoms must ex-\nceed what is expected in a given environment and culture for the child’s developmental\nstage. Compared with adult onset of bipolar II disorder, childhood or adolescent onset of\nthe disorder may be associated with a more severe lifetime course. The 3-year incidence\nrate of first-onset bipolar II disorder in adults older than 60 years is 0.34%. However, dis-\ntinguishing individuals older than 60 years with bipolar II disorder by late versus early\nage at onset does not appear to have any clinical utility.Cyclothymic disorder usually begins in adolescence or early adult life and is sometimes\nconsidered to reflect a temperamental predisposition to other disorders in this chapter.\nCyclothymic disorder usually has an insidious onset and a persistent course. There is a\n15%–50% risk that an individual with cyclothymic disorder will subsequently develop bi-\npolar I disorder or bipolar II disorder. Onset of persistent, fluctuating hypomanic and de-\npressive symptoms late in adult life needs to be clearly differentiated from bipolar and\nCyclothymic Disorder\n141\nrelated disorder due to another medical condition and depressive disorder due to another\nmedical condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis) before the cyclothymic disorder diagnosis is as-\nsigned. Among children with cyclothymic disorder, the mean age at onset of symptoms is\n6.5 years of age.In phencyclidine-induced mania, the initial presentation may be one of a delirium with af-\nfective features, which then becomes an atypically appearing manic or mixed manic state.\nBipolar and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\n145\nThis condition follows the ingestion or inhalation quickly, usually within hours or, at the\nmost, a few days. In stimulant-induced manic or hypomanic states, the response is in min-\nutes to 1 hour after one or several ingestions or injections. The episode is very brief and\ntypically resolves over 1–2 days. With corticosteroids and some immunosuppressant\nmedications, the mania (or mixed or depressed state) usually follows several days of in-\ngestion, and the higher doses appear to have a much greater likelihood of producing bi-\npolar symptoms.Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition usually has its onset acutely\nor subacutely within the first weeks or month of the onset of the associated medical con-\ndition. However, this is not always the case, as a worsening or later relapse of the associ-\nated medical condition may precede the onset of the manic or hypomanic syndrome. The\nclinician must make a clinical judgment in these situations about whether the medical con-\ndition is causative, based on temporal sequence as well as plausibility of a causal relation-\nBipolar and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\n147\nship. Finally, the condition may remit before or just after the medical condition remits,\nparticularly when treatment of the manic/hypomanic symptoms is effective.The onset of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder must be before age 10 years, and the\ndiagnosis should not be applied to children with a developmental age of less than 6 years.\nIt is unknown whether the condition presents only in this age-delimited fashion. Because\nthe symptoms of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are likely to change as children\nmature, use of the diagnosis should be restricted to age groups similar to those in which\nvalidity has been established (7–18 years). Approximately half of children with severe,\nchronic irritability will have a presentation that continues to meet criteria for the condition\n1 year later. Rates of conversion from severe, nonepisodic irritability to bipolar disorder\nare very low. Instead, children with chronic irritability are at risk to develop unipolar de-\npressive and/or anxiety disorders in adulthood.\nAge-related variations also differentiate classic bipolar disorder and disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder. Rates of bipolar disorder generally are very low prior to adoles-\ncence (<1%), with a steady increase into early adulthood (1%–2% prevalence). Disruptive\nmood dysregulation disorder is more common than bipolar disorder prior to adolescence,\nand symptoms of the condition generally become less common as children transition into\nadulthood.Major depressive disorder may first appear at any age, but the likelihood of onset in-\ncreases markedly with puberty. In the United States, incidence appears to peak in the 20s;\nhowever, first onset in late life is not uncommon.\nThe course of major depressive disorder is quite variable, such that some individuals\nrarely, if ever, experience remission (a period of 2 or more months with no symptoms, or\nonly one or two symptoms to no more than a mild degree), while others experience many\nyears with few or no symptoms between discrete episodes. It is important to distinguish\nindividuals who present for treatment during an exacerbation of a chronic depressive ill-\nness from those whose symptoms developed recently. Chronicity of depressive symptoms\nsubstantially increases the likelihood of underlying personality, anxiety, and substance\nuse disorders and decreases the likelihood that treatment will be followed by full symp-\ntom resolution. It is therefore useful to ask individuals presenting with depressive symp-\ntoms to identify the last period of at least 2 months during which they were entirely free of\ndepressive symptoms.\nRecovery typically begins within 3 months of onset for two in five individuals with ma-\njor depression and within 1 year for four in five individuals. Recency of onset is a strong\ndeterminant of the likelihood of near-term recovery, and many individuals who have been\ndepressed only for several months can be expected to recover spontaneously. Features as-\nsociated with lower recovery rates, other than current episode duration, include psychotic\nfeatures, prominent anxiety, personality disorders, and symptom severity.\nThe risk of recurrence becomes progessively lower over time as the duration of re-\nmission increases. The risk is higher in individuals whose preceding episode was severe,\nin younger individuals, and in individuals who have already experienced multiple epi-\nsodes. The persistence of even mild depressive symptoms during remission is a powerful\npredictor of recurrence.\nMany bipolar illnesses begin with one or more depressive episodes, and a substantial\nproportion of individuals who initially appear to have major depressive disorder will\nprove, in time, to instead have a bipolar disorder. This is more likely in individuals with\nonset of the illness in adolescence, those with psychotic features, and those with a family\nhistory of bipolar illness. The presence of a “with mixed features” specifier also increases\nthe risk for future manic or hypomanic diagnosis. Major depressive disorder, particularly\nwith psychotic features, may also transition into schizophrenia, a change that is much\nmore frequent than the reverse.\n166\nDepressive Disorders\nDespite consistent differences between genders in prevalence rates for depressive disor-\nders, there appear to be no clear differences by gender in phenomenology, course, or treat-\nment response. Similarly, there are no clear effects of current age on the course or treatment\nresponse of major depressive disorder. Some symptom differences exist, though, such that\nhypersomnia and hyperphagia are more likely in younger individuals, and melancholic\nsymptoms, particularly psychomotor disturbances, are more common in older individuals.\nThe likelihood of suicide attempts lessens in middle and late life, although the risk of com-\npleted suicide does not. Depressions with earlier ages at onset are more familial and more\nlikely to involve personality disturbances. The course of major depressive disorder within\nindividuals does not generally change with aging. Mean times to recovery appear to be sta-\nble over long periods, and the likelihood of being in an episode does not generally increase\nor decrease with time.Persistent depressive disorder often has an early and insidious onset (i.e., in childhood,\nadolescence, or early adult life) and, by definition, a chronic course. Among individuals\nwith both persistent depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder, the covari-\nance of the corresponding features over time suggests the operation of a common mecha-\nnism. Early onset (i.e., before age 21 years) is associated with a higher likelihood of\ncomorbid personality disorders and substance use disorders.\nWhen symptoms rise to the level of a major depressive episode, they are likely to sub-\nsequently revert to a lower level. However, depressive symptoms are much less likely to\nresolve in a given period of time in the context of persistent depressive disorder than they\nare in a major depressive episode.Onset of premenstrual dysphoric disorder can occur at any point after menarche. Inci-\ndence of new cases over a 40-month follow-up period is 2.5% (95% confidence interval =\n1.7–3.7). Anecdotally, many individuals, as they approach menopause, report that symp-\ntoms worsen. Symptoms cease after menopause, although cyclical hormone replacement\ncan trigger the re-expression of symptoms.A depressive disorder associated with the use of substance (i.e., alcohol, illicit drugs, or a\nprescribed treatment for a mental disorder or another medical condition) must have its on-\nset while the individual is using the substance or during withdrawal, if there is a with-\ndrawal syndrome associated with the substance. Most often, the depressive disorder has\nits onset within the first few weeks or 1 month of use of the substance. Once the substance\nis discontinued, the depressive symptoms usually remit within days to several weeks, de-\npending on the half-life of the substance/medication and the presence of a withdrawal\nsyndrome. If symptoms persist 4 weeks beyond the expected time course of withdrawal of\na particular substance/medication, other causes for the depressive mood symptoms\nshould be considered.\nAlthough there are a few prospective controlled trials examining the association of de-\npressive symptoms with use of a medication, most reports are from postmarketing sur-\nveillance studies, retrospective observational studies, or case reports, making evidence of\ncausality difficult to determine. Substances implicated in medication-induced depressive\ndisorder, with varying degrees of evidence, include antiviral agents (efavirenz), cardio-\nvascular agents (clonidine, guanethidine, methyldopa, reserpine), retinoic acid deriva-\ntives (isotretinoin), antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anti-migraine agents (triptans),\nantipsychotics, hormonal agents (corticosteroids, oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-\nreleasing hormone agonists, tamoxifen), smoking cessation agents (varenicline), and im-\nmunological agents (interferon). However, other potential substances continue to emerge\nas new compounds are synthesized. A history of such substance use may help increase di-\nagnostic certainty.Following stroke, the onset of depression appears to be very acute, occurring within 1 day\nor a few days of the cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in the largest case series. However, in\n182\nDepressive Disorders\nsome cases, onset of the depression is weeks to months following the CVA. In the largest\nseries, the duration of the major depressive episode following stroke was 9–11 months on\naverage. Similarly, in Huntington’s disease the depressive state comes quite early in the\ncourse of the illness. With Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease, it often precedes\nthe major motor impairments and cognitive impairments associated with each condition.\nThis is more prominently the case for Huntington’s disease, in which depression is con-\nsidered to be the first neuropsychiatric symptom. There is some observational evidence\nthat depression is less common as the dementia of Huntington’s disease progresses.Periods of heightened separation anxiety from attachment figures are part of normal early\ndevelopment and may indicate the development of secure attachment relationships (e.g.,\naround 1 year of age, when infants may suffer from stranger anxiety). Onset of separation\nanxiety disorder may be as early as preschool age and may occur at any time during child-\nhood and more rarely in adolescence. Typically there are periods of exacerbation and re-\nmission. In some cases, both the anxiety about possible separation and the avoidance of\nsituations involving separation from the home or nuclear family (e.g., going away to col-\nlege, moving away from attachment figures) may persist through adulthood. However,\nthe majority of children with separation anxiety disorder are free of impairing anxiety dis-\norders over their lifetimes. Many adults with separation anxiety disorder do not recall a\nchildhood onset of separation anxiety disorder, although they may recall symptoms.\nSeparation Anxiety Disorder\n193\nThe manifestations of separation anxiety disorder vary with age. Younger children are\nmore reluctant to go to school or may avoid school altogether. Younger children may not\nexpress worries or specific fears of definite threats to parents, home, or themselves, and the\nanxiety is manifested only when separation is experienced. As children age, worries\nemerge; these are often worries about specific dangers (e.g., accidents, kidnapping, mug-\nging, death) or vague concerns about not being reunited with attachment figures. In adults,\nseparation anxiety disorder may limit their ability to cope with changes in circumstances\n(e.g., moving, getting married). Adults with the disorder are typically overconcerned about\ntheir offspring and spouses and experience marked discomfort when separated from them.\nThey may also experience significant disruption in work or social experiences because of\nneeding to continuously check on the whereabouts of a significant other.The onset of selective mutism is usually before age 5 years, but the disturbance may not\ncome to clinical attention until entry into school, where there is an increase in social inter-\naction and performance tasks, such as reading aloud. The persistence of the disorder is\nvariable. Although clinical reports suggest that many individuals “outgrow” selective\nmutism, the longitudinal course of the disorder is unknown. In some cases, particularly in\nindividuals with social anxiety disorder, selective mutism may disappear, but symptoms\nof social anxiety disorder remain.Specific phobia sometimes develops following a traumatic event (e.g., being attacked by\nan animal or stuck in an elevator), observation of others going through a traumatic event (e.g.,\n200\nAnxiety Disorders\nwatching someone drown), an unexpected panic attack in the to be feared situation (e.g.,\nan unexpected panic attack while on the subway), or informational transmission (e.g., ex-\ntensive media coverage of a plane crash). However, many individuals with specific phobia\nare unable to recall the specific reason for the onset of their phobias. Specific phobia usu-\nally develops in early childhood, with the majority of cases developing prior to age 10\nyears. The median age at onset is between 7 and 11 years, with the mean at about 10 years.\nSituational specific phobias tend to have a later age at onset than natural environment, an-\nimal, or blood-injection-injury specific phobias. Specific phobias that develop in child-\nhood and adolescence are likely to wax and wane during that period. However, phobias\nthat do persist into adulthood are unlikely to remit for the majority of individuals.\nWhen specific phobia is being diagnosed in children, two issues should be considered.\nFirst, young children may express their fear and anxiety by crying, tantrums, freezing,\nor clinging. Second, young children typically are not able to understand the concept of\navoidance. Therefore, the clinician should assemble additional information from parents,\nteachers, or others who know the child well. Excessive fears are quite common in young\nchildren but are usually transitory and only mildly impairing and thus considered devel-\nopmentally appropriate. In such cases a diagnosis of specific phobia would not be made.\nWhen the diagnosis of specific phobia is being considered in a child, it is important to\nassess the degree of impairment and the duration of the fear, anxiety, or avoidance, and\nwhether it is typical for the child’s particular developmental stage.\nAlthough the prevalence of specific phobia is lower in older populations, it remains\none of the more commonly experienced disorders in late life. Several issues should be con-\nsidered when diagnosing specific phobia in older populations. First, older individuals\nmay be more likely to endorse natural environment specific phobias, as well as phobias of\nfalling. Second, specific phobia (like all anxiety disorders) tends to co-occur with medical\nconcerns in older individuals, including coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease. Third, older individuals may be more likely to attribute the symptoms\nof anxiety to medical conditions. Fourth, older individuals may be more likely to manifest\nanxiety in an atypical manner (e.g., involving symptoms of both anxiety and depression)\nand thus be more likely to warrant a diagnosis of unspecified anxiety disorder. Addition-\nally, the presence of specific phobia in older adults is associated with decreased quality of\nlife and may serve as a risk factor for major neurocognitive disorder.\nAlthough most specific phobias develop in childhood and adolescence, it is possible for a\nspecific phobia to develop at any age, often as the result of experiences that are traumatic. For\nexample, phobias of choking almost always follow a near-choking event at any age.Median age at onset of social anxiety disorder in the United States is 13 years, and 75% of\nindividuals have an age at onset between 8 and 15 years. The disorder sometimes emerges\nout of a childhood history of social inhibition or shyness in U.S. and European studies. On-\nset can also occur in early childhood. Onset of social anxiety disorder may follow a stress-\nful or humiliating experience (e.g., being bullied, vomiting during a public speech), or it\nmay be insidious, developing slowly. First onset in adulthood is relatively rare and is more\nlikely to occur after a stressful or humiliating event or after life changes that require new\nsocial roles (e.g., marrying someone from a different social class, receiving a job promo-\ntion). Social anxiety disorder may diminish after an individual with fear of dating marries\nand may reemerge after divorce. Among individuals presenting to clinical care, the disor-\nder tends to be particularly persistent.\nAdolescents endorse a broader pattern of fear and avoidance, including of dating,\ncompared with younger children. Older adults express social anxiety at lower levels but\nacross a broader range of situations, whereas younger adults express higher levels of so-\ncial anxiety for specific situations. In older adults, social anxiety may concern disability\ndue to declining sensory functioning (hearing, vision) or embarrassment about one’s ap-\npearance (e.g., tremor as a symptom of Parkinson’s disease) or functioning due to medical\nconditions, incontinence, or cognitive impairment (e.g., forgetting people’s names). In the\ncommunity approximately 30% of individuals with social anxiety disorder experience re-\nmission of symptoms within 1 year, and about 50% experience remission within a few\nyears. For approximately 60% of individuals without a specific treatment for social anxiety\ndisorder, the course takes several years or longer.\nDetection of social anxiety disorder in older adults may be challenging because of sev-\neral factors, including a focus on somatic symptoms, comorbid medical illness, limited\ninsight, changes to social environment or roles that may obscure impairment in social\nfunctioning, or reticence about describing psychological distress.The median age at onset for panic disorder in the United States is 20–24 years. A small\nnumber of cases begin in childhood, and onset after age 45 years is unusual but can occur.\nThe usual course, if the disorder is untreated, is chronic but waxing and waning. Some in-\ndividuals may have episodic outbreaks with years of remission in between, and others\nmay have continuous severe symptomatology. Only a minority of individuals have full\nremission without subsequent relapse within a few years. The course of panic disorder\ntypically is complicated by a range of other disorders, in particular other anxiety disor-\nders, depressive disorders, and substance use disorders (see section “Comorbidity” for\nthis disorder).\nAlthough panic disorder is very rare in childhood, first occurrence of “fearful spells” is\noften dated retrospectively back to childhood. As in adults, panic disorder in adolescents\ntends to have a chronic course and is frequently comorbid with other anxiety, depressive,\nand bipolar disorders. To date, no differences in the clinical presentation between adoles-\ncents and adults have been found. However, adolescents may be less worried about addi-\ntional panic attacks than are young adults. Lower prevalence of panic disorder in older\nadults appears to be attributable to age-related “dampening” of the autonomic nervous\nsystem response. Many older individuals with “panicky feelings” are observed to have a\n“hybrid” of limited-symptom panic attacks and generalized anxiety. Also, older adults\nPanic Disorder\n211\ntend to attribute their panic attacks to certain stressful situations, such as a medical pro-\ncedure or social setting. Older individuals may retrospectively endorse explanations for\nthe panic attack (which would preclude the diagnosis of panic disorder), even if an attack\nmight actually have been unexpected in the moment (and thus qualify as the basis for a\npanic disorder diagnosis). This may result in under-endorsement of unexpected panic at-\ntacks in older individuals. Thus, careful questioning of older adults is required to assess\nwhether panic attacks were expected before entering the situation, so that unexpected\npanic attacks and the diagnosis of panic disorder are not overlooked.\nWhile the low rate of panic disorder in children could relate to difficulties in symptom\nreporting, this seems unlikely given that children are capable of reporting intense fear or\npanic in relation to separation and to phobic objects or phobic situations. Adolescents\nmight be less willing than adults to openly discuss panic attacks. Therefore, clinicians\nshould be aware that unexpected panic attacks do occur in adolescents, much as they do in\nadults, and be attuned to this possibility when encountering adolescents presenting with\nepisodes of intense fear or distress.The mean age at onset for panic attacks in the United States is approximately 22–23 years\namong adults. However, the course of panic attacks is likely influenced by the course of\nany co-occurring mental disorder(s) and stressful life events. Panic attacks are uncommon,\nand unexpected panic attacks are rare, in preadolescent children. Adolescents might be\nless willing than adults to openly discuss panic attacks, even though they present with ep-\nisodes of intense fear or discomfort. Lower prevalence of panic attacks in older individuals\nmay be related to a weaker autonomic response to emotional states relative to younger in-\ndividuals. Older individuals may be less inclined to use the word “fear” and more inclined\n216\nAnxiety Disorders\nto use the word “discomfort” to describe panic attacks. Older individuals with “panicky\nfeelings” may have a hybrid of limited-symptom attacks and generalized anxiety. In\naddition, older individuals tend to attribute panic attacks to certain situations that are\nstressful (e.g., medical procedures, social settings) and may retrospectively endorse expla-\nnations for the panic attack even if it was unexpected in the moment. This may result in un-\nder-endorsement of unexpected panic attacks in older individuals.The percentage of individuals with agoraphobia reporting panic attacks or panic disorder\npreceding the onset of agoraphobia ranges from 30% in community samples to more than\n50% in clinic samples. The majority of individuals with panic disorder show signs of anx-\niety and agoraphobia before the onset of panic disorder.\nIn two-thirds of all cases of agoraphobia, initial onset is before age 35 years. There is a\nsubstantial incidence risk in late adolescence and early adulthood, with indications for\na second high incidence risk phase after age 40 years. First onset in childhood is rare. The\noverall mean age at onset for agoraphobia is 17 years, although the age at onset without\npreceding panic attacks or panic disorder is 25–29 years.\nThe course of agoraphobia is typically persistent and chronic. Complete remission is\nrare (10%), unless the agoraphobia is treated. With more severe agoraphobia, rates of full\nremission decrease, whereas rates of relapse and chronicity increase. A range of other dis-\norders, in particular other anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, substance use disor-\nders, and personality disorders, may complicate the course of agoraphobia. The long-term\n220\nAnxiety Disorders\ncourse and outcome of agoraphobia are associated with substantially elevated risk of sec-\nondary major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), and sub-\nstance use disorders.\nThe clinical features of agoraphobia are relatively consistent across the lifespan, although\nthe type of agoraphobic situations triggering fear, anxiety, or avoidance, as well as the type of\ncognitions, may vary. For example, in children, being outside of the home alone is the most fre-\nquent situation feared, whereas in older adults, being in shops, standing in line, and being in\nopen spaces are most often feared. Also, cognitions often pertain to becoming lost (in children),\nto experiencing panic-like symptoms (in adults), to falling (in older adults).\nThe low prevalence of agoraphobia in children could reflect difficulties in symptom re-\nporting, and thus assessments in young children may require solicitation of information\nfrom multiple sources, including parents or teachers. Adolescents, particularly males,\nmay be less willing than adults to openly discuss agoraphobic fears and avoidance; how-\never, agoraphobia can occur prior to adulthood and should be assessed in children and\nadolescents. In older adults, comorbid somatic symptom disorders, as well as motor dis-\nturbances (e.g., sense of falling or having medical complications), are frequently men-\ntioned by individuals as the reason for their fear and avoidance. In these instances, care is\nto be taken in evaluating whether the fear and avoidance are out of proportion to the real\ndanger involved.Many individuals with generalized anxiety disorder report that they have felt anxious and\nnervous all of their lives. The median age at onset for generalized anxiety disorder is 30\nyears; however, age at onset is spread over a very broad range. The median age at onset is\nlater than that for the other anxiety disorders. The symptoms of excessive worry and anx-\niety may occur early in life but are then manifested as an anxious temperament. Onset of\nthe disorder rarely occurs prior to adolescence. The symptoms of generalized anxiety dis-\norder tend to be chronic and wax and wane across the lifespan, fluctuating between syn-\ndromal and subsyndromal forms of the disorder. Rates of full remission are very low.\nThe clinical expression of generalized anxiety disorder is relatively consistent across\nthe lifespan. The primary difference across age groups is in the content of the individual’s\nworry. Children and adolescents tend to worry more about school and sporting perfor-\nmance, whereas older adults report greater concern about the well-being of family or their\nown physical heath. Thus, the content of an individual’s worry tends to be age appropri-\nate. Younger adults experience greater severity of symptoms than do older adults.\nThe earlier in life individuals have symptoms that meet criteria for generalized anxiety\ndisorder, the more comorbidity they tend to have and the more impaired they are likely to\n224\nAnxiety Disorders\nbe. The advent of chronic physical disease can be a potent issue for excessive worry in the\nelderly. In the frail elderly, worries about safety—and especially about falling—may limit\nactivities. In those with early cognitive impairment, what appears to be excessive worry\nabout, for example, the whereabouts of things is probably better regarded as realistic\ngiven the cognitive impairment.\nIn children and adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder, the anxieties and wor-\nries often concern the quality of their performance or competence at school or in sporting\nevents, even when their performance is not being evaluated by others. There may be ex-\ncessive concerns about punctuality. They may also worry about catastrophic events, such\nas earthquakes or nuclear war. Children with the disorder may be overly conforming, per-\nfectionist, and unsure of themselves and tend to redo tasks because of excessive dissatis-\nfaction with less-than-perfect performance. They are typically overzealous in seeking\nreassurance and approval and require excessive reassurance about their performance and\nother things they are worried about.\nGeneralized anxiety disorder may be overdiagnosed in children. When this diagnosis\nis being considered in children, a thorough evaluation for the presence of other childhood\nanxiety disorders and other mental disorders should be done to determine whether the\nworries may be better explained by one of these disorders. Separation anxiety disorder, so-\ncial anxiety disorder (social phobia), and obsessive-compulsive disorder are often accom-\npanied by worries that may mimic those described in generalized anxiety disorder. For\nexample, a child with social anxiety disorder may be concerned about school performance\nbecause of fear of humiliation. Worries about illness may also be better explained by sep-\naration anxiety disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder.The development and course of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition gen-\nerally follows the course of the underlying illness. This diagnosis is not meant to include\nprimary anxiety disorders that arise in the context of chronic medical illness. This is im-\nportant to consider with older adults, who may experience chronic medical illness and\nthen develop independent anxiety disorders secondary to the chronic medical illness.In the United States, the mean age at onset of OCD is 19.5 years, and 25% of cases start by\nage 14 years. Onset after age 35 years is unusual but does occur. Males have an earlier age\nat onset than females: nearly 25% of males have onset before age 10 years. The onset of\nsymptoms is typically gradual; however, acute onset has also been reported.\nIf OCD is untreated, the course is usually chronic, often with waxing and waning symp-\ntoms. Some individuals have an episodic course, and a minority have a deteriorating\ncourse. Without treatment, remission rates in adults are low (e.g., 20% for those reevalu-\nated 40 years later). Onset in childhood or adolescence can lead to a lifetime of OCD. How-\never, 40% of individuals with onset of OCD in childhood or adolescence may experience\nremission by early adulthood. The course of OCD is often complicated by the co-occurrence\nof other disorders (see section “Comorbidity” for this disorder).\nCompulsions are more easily diagnosed in children than obsessions are because com-\npulsions are observable. However, most children have both obsessions and compulsions\n(as do most adults). The pattern of symptoms in adults can be stable over time, but it is\nmore variable in children. Some differences in the content of obsessions and compulsions\nhave been reported when children and adolescent samples have been compared with\nadult samples. These differences likely reflect content appropriate to different develop-\nmental stages (e.g., higher rates of sexual and religious obsessions in adolescents than in\nchildren; higher rates of harm obsessions [e.g., fears of catastrophic events, such as death\nor illness to self or loved ones] in children and adolescents than in adults).The mean age at disorder onset is 16–17 years, the median age at onset is 15 years, and the\nmost common age at onset is 12–13 years. Two-thirds of individuals have disorder onset\nbefore age 18. Subclinical body dysmorphic disorder symptoms begin, on average, at age\n12 or 13 years. Subclinical concerns usually evolve gradually to the full disorder, although\nsome individuals experience abrupt onset of body dysmorphic disorder. The disorder\nappears to usually be chronic, although improvement is likely when evidence-based\ntreatment is received. The disorder’s clinical features appear largely similar in children/\nadolescents and adults. Body dysmorphic disorder occurs in the elderly, but little is known\nabout the disorder in this age group. Individuals with disorder onset before age 18 years\nare more likely to attempt suicide, have more comorbidity, and have gradual (rather than\nacute) disorder onset than those with adult-onset body dysmorphic disorder.\nBody Dysmorphic Disorder\n245Hoarding appears to begin early in life and spans well into the late stages. Hoarding symp-\ntoms may first emerge around ages 11–15 years, start interfering with the individual’s ev-\neryday functioning by the mid-20s, and cause clinically significant impairment by the\nmid-30s. Participants in clinical research studies are usually in their 50s. Thus, the severity\nof hoarding increases with each decade of life. Once symptoms begin, the course of hoard-\ning is often chronic, with few individuals reporting a waxing and waning course.\nPathological hoarding in children appears to be easily distinguished from develop-\nmentally adaptive saving and collecting behaviors. Because children and adolescents\ntypically do not control their living environment and discarding behaviors, the possible\nintervention of third parties (e.g., parents keeping the spaces usable and thus reducing in-\nterference) should be considered when making the diagnosis.Hair pulling may be seen in infants, and this behavior typically resolves during early devel-\nopment. Onset of hair pulling in trichotillomania most commonly coincides with, or follows\nthe onset of, puberty. Sites of hair pulling may vary over time. The usual course of trichotillo-\nmania is chronic, with some waxing and waning if the disorder is untreated. Symptoms may\npossibly worsen in females accompanying hormonal changes (e.g., menstruation, perimeno-\npause). For some individuals, the disorder may come and go for weeks, months, or years at a\ntime. A minority of individuals remit without subsequent relapse within a few years of onset.Although individuals with excoriation disorder may present at various ages, the skin pick-\ning most often has onset during adolescence, commonly coinciding with or following the\nonset of puberty. The disorder frequently begins with a dermatological condition, such\nas acne. Sites of skin picking may vary over time. The usual course is chronic, with some\nwaxing and waning if untreated. For some individuals, the disorder may come and go for\nweeks, months, or years at a time.The development and course of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another\nmedical condition generally follows the course of the underlying illness.Conditions of social neglect are often present in the first months of life in children diag-\nnosed with reactive attachment disorder, even before the disorder is diagnosed. The clin-\nical features of the disorder manifest in a similar fashion between the ages of 9 months and\n5 years. That is, signs of absent-to-minimal attachment behaviors and associated emotion-\nally aberrant behaviors are evident in children throughout this age range, although differ-\ning cognitive and motor abilities may affect how these behaviors are expressed. Without\nremediation and recovery through normative caregiving environments, it appears that signs\nof the disorder may persist, at least for several years.\nIt is unclear whether reactive attachment disorder occurs in older children and, if so, how\nit differs from its presentation in young children. Because of this, the diagnosis should be\nmade with caution in children older than 5 years.Conditions of social neglect are often present in the first months of life in children diag-\nnosed with disinhibited social engagement disorder, even before the disorder is diag-\nnosed. However, there is no evidence that neglect beginning after age 2 years is associated\nwith manifestations of the disorder. If neglect occurs early and signs of the disorder\nappear, clinical features of the disorder are moderately stable over time, particularly if\nconditions of neglect persist. Indiscriminate social behavior and lack of reticence with un-\nfamiliar adults in toddlerhood are accompanied by attention-seeking behaviors in pre-\nschoolers. When the disorder persists into middle childhood, clinical features manifest as\nverbal and physical overfamiliarity as well as inauthentic expression of emotions. These\nsigns appear particularly apparent when the child interacts with adults. Peer relationships\nare most affected in adolescence, with both indiscriminate behavior and conflicts appar-\nent. The disorder has not been described in adults.\n270\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\nDisinhibited social engagement disorder has been described from the second year of\nlife through adolescence. There are some differences in manifestations of the disorder\nfrom early childhood through adolescence. At the youngest ages, across many cultures,\nchildren show reticence when interacting with strangers. Young children with the disorder\nfail to show reticence to approach, engage with, and even accompany adults. In preschool\nchildren, verbal and social intrusiveness appear most prominent, often accompanied by\nattention-seeking behavior. Verbal and physical overfamiliarity continue through middle\nchildhood, accompanied by inauthentic expressions of emotion. In adolescence, indis-\ncriminate behavior extends to peers. Relative to healthy adolescents, adolescents with the\ndisorder have more “superficial” peer relationships and more peer conflicts. Adult man-\nifestations of the disorder are unknown.PTSD can occur at any age, beginning after the first year of life. Symptoms usually begin\nwithin the first 3 months after the trauma, although there may be a delay of months, or\neven years, before criteria for the diagnosis are met. There is abundant evidence for what\nDSM-IV called “delayed onset” but is now called “delayed expression,” with the recogni-\ntion that some symptoms typically appear immediately and that the delay is in meeting\nfull criteria.\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder\n277\nFrequently, an individual’s reaction to a trauma initially meets criteria for acute stress\ndisorder in the immediate aftermath of the trauma. The symptoms of PTSD and the rela-\ntive predominance of different symptoms may vary over time. Duration of the symptoms\nalso varies, with complete recovery within 3 months occurring in approximately one-half\nof adults, while some individuals remain symptomatic for longer than 12 months and\nsometimes for more than 50 years. Symptom recurrence and intensification may occur in\nresponse to reminders of the original trauma, ongoing life stressors, or newly experienced\ntraumatic events. For older individuals, declining health, worsening cognitive function-\ning, and social isolation may exacerbate PTSD symptoms.\nThe clinical expression of reexperiencing can vary across development. Young children\nmay report new onset of frightening dreams without content specific to the traumatic event.\nBefore age 6 years (see criteria for preschool subtype), young children are more likely to ex-\npress reexperiencing symptoms through play that refers directly or symbolically to the\ntrauma. They may not manifest fearful reactions at the time of the exposure or during reex-\nperiencing. Parents may report a wide range of emotional or behavioral changes in young\nchildren. Children may focus on imagined interventions in their play or storytelling. In ad-\ndition to avoidance, children may become preoccupied with reminders. Because of young\nchildren’s limitations in expressing thoughts or labeling emotions, negative alterations in\nmood or cognition tend to involve primarily mood changes. Children may experience co-\noccurring traumas (e.g., physical abuse, witnessing domestic violence) and in chronic cir-\ncumstances may not be able to identify onset of symptomatology. Avoidant behavior may\nbe associated with restricted play or exploratory behavior in young children; reduced par-\nticipation in new activities in school-age children; or reluctance to pursue developmental op-\nportunities in adolescents (e.g., dating, driving). Older children and adolescents may judge\nthemselves as cowardly. Adolescents may harbor beliefs of being changed in ways that\nmake them socially undesirable and estrange them from peers (e.g., “Now I’ll never fit in”)\nand lose aspirations for the future. Irritable or aggressive behavior in children and adoles-\ncents can interfere with peer relationships and school behavior. Reckless behavior may lead\nto accidental injury to self or others, thrill-seeking, or high-risk behaviors. Individuals who\ncontinue to experience PTSD into older adulthood may express fewer symptoms of hy-\nperarousal, avoidance, and negative cognitions and mood compared with younger adults\nwith PTSD, although adults exposed to traumatic events during later life may display more\navoidance, hyperarousal, sleep problems, and crying spells than do younger adults exposed\nto the same traumatic events. In older individuals, the disorder is associated with negative\nhealth perceptions, primary care utilization, and suicidal ideation.Acute stress disorder cannot be diagnosed until 3 days after a traumatic event. Although\nacute stress disorder may progress to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after 1 month,\nit may also be a transient stress response that remits within 1 month of trauma exposure\nand does not result in PTSD. Approximately half of individuals who eventually develop\nPTSD initially present with acute stress disorder. Symptom worsening during the initial\nmonth can occur, often as a result of ongoing life stressors or further traumatic events.\nThe forms of reexperiencing can vary across development. Unlike adults or adoles-\ncents, young children may report frightening dreams without content that clearly reflects\naspects of the trauma (e.g., waking in fright in the aftermath of the trauma but being unable\nto relate the content of the dream to the traumatic event). Children age 6 years and younger\nare more likely than older children to express reexperiencing symptoms through play that\nrefers directly or symbolically to the trauma. For example, a very young child who sur-\nvived a fire may draw pictures of flames. Young children also do not necessarily manifest\nfearful reactions at the time of the exposure or even during reexperiencing. Parents typi-\ncally report a range of emotional expressions, such as anger, shame, or withdrawal, and\neven excessively bright positive affect, in young children who are traumatized. Although\nchildren may avoid reminders of the trauma, they sometimes become preoccupied with\nreminders (e.g., a young child bitten by a dog may talk about dogs constantly yet avoid go-\ning outside because of fear of coming into contact with a dog).By definition, the disturbance in adjustment disorders begins within 3 months of onset of\na stressor and lasts no longer than 6 months after the stressor or its consequences have\nceased. If the stressor is an acute event (e.g., being fired from a job), the onset of the dis-\nturbance is usually immediate (i.e., within a few days) and the duration is relatively brief\n(i.e., no more than a few months). If the stressor or its consequences persist, the adjustment\ndisorder may also continue to be present and become the persistent form.\n288\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related DisordersDissociative identity disorder is associated with overwhelming experiences, traumatic\nevents, and/or abuse occurring in childhood. The full disorder may first manifest at al-\nmost any age (from earliest childhood to late life). Dissociation in children may generate\nproblems with memory, concentration, attachment, and traumatic play. Nevertheless, chil-\ndren usually do not present with identity changes; instead they present primarily with over-\nlap and interference among mental states (Criterion A phenomena), with symptoms related\nto discontinuities of experience. Sudden changes in identity during adolescence may ap-\npear to be just adolescent turmoil or the early stages of another mental disorder. Older\nindividuals may present to treatment with what appear to be late-life mood disorders, ob-\nsessive-compulsive disorder, paranoia, psychotic mood disorders, or even cognitive dis-\norders due to dissociative amnesia. In some cases, disruptive affects and memories may\nincreasingly intrude into awareness with advancing age.\nPsychological decompensation and overt changes in identity may be triggered by 1) re-\nmoval from the traumatizing situation (e.g., through leaving home); 2) the individual’s\nchildren reaching the same age at which the individual was originally abused or trauma-\ntized; 3) later traumatic experiences, even seemingly inconsequential ones, like a minor\nmotor vehicle accident; or 4) the death of, or the onset of a fatal illness in, their abuser(s).Onset of generalized amnesia is usually sudden. Less is known about the onset of localized\nand selective amnesias because these amnesias are seldom evident, even to the individual.\nAlthough overwhelming or intolerable events typically precede localized amnesia, its on-\nset may be delayed for hours, days, or longer.\nIndividuals may report multiple episodes of dissociative amnesia. A single episode\nmay predispose to future episodes. In between episodes of amnesia, the individual may or\nmay not appear to be acutely symptomatic. The duration of the forgotten events can range\nfrom minutes to decades. Some episodes of dissociative amnesia resolve rapidly (e.g.,\nwhen the person is removed from combat or some other stressful situation), whereas other\nepisodes persist for long periods of time. Some individuals may gradually recall the dis-\nsociated memories years later. Dissociative capacities may decline with age, but not al-\nways. As the amnesia remits, there may be considerable distress, suicidal behavior, and\nsymptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nDissociative amnesia has been observed in young children, adolescents, and adults.\nChildren may be the most difficult to evaluate because they often have difficulty under-\nstanding questions about amnesia, and interviewers may find it difficult to formulate child-\nfriendly questions about memory and amnesia. Observations of apparent dissociative am-\nnesia are often difficult to differentiate from inattention, absorption, anxiety, oppositional\nbehavior, and learning disorders. Reports from several different sources (e.g., teacher,\ntherapist, case worker) may be needed to diagnose amnesia in children.The mean age at onset of depersonalization/derealization disorder is 16 years, although the\ndisorder can start in early or middle childhood; a minority cannot recall ever not having had\n304\nDissociative Disorders\nthe symptoms. Less than 20% of individuals experience onset after age 20 years and only\n5% after age 25 years. Onset in the fourth decade of life or later is highly unusual. Onset can\nrange from extremely sudden to gradual. Duration of depersonalization/derealization\ndisorder episodes can vary greatly, from brief (hours or days) to prolonged (weeks,\nmonths, or years). Given the rarity of disorder onset after age 40 years, in such cases the in-\ndividual should be examined more closely for underlying medical conditions (e.g., brain\nlesions, seizure disorders, sleep apnea). The course of the disorder is often persistent.\nAbout one-third of cases involve discrete episodes; another third, continuous symptoms\nfrom the start; and still another third, an initially episodic course that eventually becomes\ncontinuous.\nWhile in some individuals the intensity of symptoms can wax and wane considerably,\nothers report an unwavering level of intensity that in extreme cases can be constantly pres-\nent for years or decades. Internal and external factors that affect symptom intensity vary\nbetween individuals, yet some typical patterns are reported. Exacerbations can be trig-\ngered by stress, worsening mood or anxiety symptoms, novel or overstimulating settings,\nand physical factors such as lighting or lack of sleep.In older individuals, somatic symptoms and concurrent medical illnesses are common,\nand a focus on Criterion B is crucial for making the diagnosis. Somatic symptom disorder\nmay be underdiagnosed in older adults either because certain somatic symptoms (e.g.,\npain, fatigue) are considered part of normal aging or because illness worry is considered\n“understandable” in older adults who have more general medical illnesses and medica-\ntions than do younger people. Concurrent depressive disorder is common in older people\nwho present with numerous somatic symptoms.\nSomatic Symptom Disorder\n313\nIn children, the most common symptoms are recurrent abdominal pain, headache, fa-\ntigue, and nausea. A single prominent symptom is more common in children than in\nadults. While young children may have somatic complaints, they rarely worry about “ill-\nness” per se prior to adolescence. The parents’ response to the symptom is important, as\nthis may determine the level of associated distress. It is the parent who may determine the\ninterpretation of symptoms and the associated time off school and medical help seeking.The development and course of illness anxiety disorder are unclear. Illness anxiety disor-\nder is generally thought to be a chronic and relapsing condition with an age at onset in\nearly and middle adulthood. In population-based samples, health-related anxiety in-\ncreases with age, but the ages of individuals with high health anxiety in medical settings\ndo not appear to differ from those of other patients in those settings. In older individuals,\nhealth-related anxiety often focuses on memory loss; the disorder is thought to be rare in\nchildren.Onset has been reported throughout the life course. The onset of non-epileptic attacks\npeaks in the third decade, and motor symptoms have their peak onset in the fourth decade.\nThe symptoms can be transient or persistent. The prognosis may be better in younger chil-\ndren than in adolescents and adults.Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions can occur across the lifespan. Par-\nticularly with young children, corroborative history from parents or school can assist the di-\nagnostic evaluation. Some conditions are characteristic of particular life stages (e.g., in older\nindividuals, the stress associated with acting as a caregiver for an ill spouse or partner).The course of factitious disorder is usually one of intermittent episodes. Single episodes\nand episodes that are characterized as persistent and unremitting are both less common.\nOnset is usually in early adulthood, often after hospitalization for a medical condition or a\nmental disorder. When imposed on another, the disorder may begin after hospitalization\nof the individual’s child or other dependent. In individuals with recurrent episodes of fal-\nsification of signs and symptoms of illness and/or induction of injury, this pattern of suc-\ncessive deceptive contact with medical personnel, including hospitalizations, may become\nlifelong.Onset of pica can occur in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood, although childhood onset\nis most commonly reported. Pica can occur in otherwise normally developing children,\nwhereas in adults, it appears more likely to occur in the context of intellectual disability or\nother mental disorders. The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances may also manifest\nin pregnancy, when specific cravings (e.g., chalk or ice) might occur. The diagnosis of pica\nduring pregnancy is only appropriate if such cravings lead to the ingestion of nonnutri-\ntive, nonfood substances to the extent that the eating of these substances poses potential\nmedical risks. The course of the disorder can be protracted and can result in medical emer-\ngencies (e.g., intestinal obstruction, acute weight loss, poisoning). The disorder can poten-\ntially be fatal depending on substances ingested.Onset of rumination disorder can occur in infancy, childhood, adolescence, or adulthood.\nThe age at onset in infants is usually between ages 3 and 12 months. In infants, the disorder\nfrequently remits spontaneously, but its course can be protracted and can result in medical\nemergencies (e.g., severe malnutrition). It can potentially be fatal, particularly in infancy.\nRumination disorder can have an episodic course or occur continuously until treated. In\ninfants, as well as in older individuals with intellectual disability (intellectual developmen-\ntal disorder) or other neurodevelopmental disorders, the regurgitation and rumination be-\nhavior appears to have a self-soothing or self-stimulating function, similar to that of other\nrepetitive motor behaviors such as head banging.Food avoidance or restriction associated with insufficient intake or lack of interest in eat-\ning most commonly develops in infancy or early childhood and may persist in adulthood.\nLikewise, avoidance based on sensory characteristics of food tends to arise in the first de-\ncade of life but may persist into adulthood. Avoidance related to aversive consequences\ncan arise at any age. The scant literature regarding long-term outcomes suggests that food\navoidance or restriction based on sensory aspects is relatively stable and long-standing,\nbut when persisting into adulthood, such avoidance/restriction can be associated with rel-\natively normal functioning. There is currently insufficient evidence directly linking avoid-\nant/restrictive food intake disorder and subsequent onset of an eating disorder.\nInfants with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder may be irritable and difficult to\nconsole during feeding, or may appear apathetic and withdrawn. In some instances, par-\nent-child interaction may contribute to the infant’s feeding problem (e.g., presenting food\ninappropriately, or interpreting the infant’s behavior as an act of aggression or rejection).\nInadequate nutritional intake may exacerbate the associated features (e.g., irritability, de-\nvelopmental lags) and further contribute to feeding difficulties. Associated factors include\ninfant temperament or developmental impairments that reduce an infant’s responsiveness\nto feeding. Coexisting parental psychopathology, or child abuse or neglect, is suggested if\nfeeding and weight improve in response to changing caregivers. In infants, children, and\nprepubertal adolescents, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder may be associated with\ngrowth delay, and the resulting malnutrition negatively affects development and learning\n336\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\npotential. In older children, adolescents, and adults, social functioning tends to be ad-\nversely affected. Regardless of the age, family function may be affected, with heightened\nstress at mealtimes and in other feeding or eating contexts involving friends and relatives.\nAvoidant/restrictive food intake disorder manifests more commonly in children than\nin adults, and there may be a long delay between onset and clinical presentation. Triggers\nfor presentation vary considerably and include physical, social, and emotional difficulties.Anorexia nervosa commonly begins during adolescence or young adulthood. It rarely be-\ngins before puberty or after age 40, but cases of both early and late onset have been de-\nscribed. The onset of this disorder is often associated with a stressful life event, such as\nleaving home for college. The course and outcome of anorexia nervosa are highly variable.\nYounger individuals may manifest atypical features, including denying “fear of fat.” Older\n342\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\nindividuals more likely have a longer duration of illness, and their clinical presentation may\ninclude more signs and symptoms of long-standing disorder. Clinicians should not exclude\nanorexia nervosa from the differential diagnosis solely on the basis of older age.\nMany individuals have a period of changed eating behavior prior to full criteria for the\ndisorder being met. Some individuals with anorexia nervosa recover fully after a single\nepisode, with some exhibiting a fluctuating pattern of weight gain followed by relapse,\nand others experiencing a chronic course over many years. Hospitalization may be re-\nquired to restore weight and to address medical complications. Most individuals with an-\norexia nervosa experience remission within 5 years of presentation. Among individuals\nadmitted to hospitals, overall remission rates may be lower. The crude mortality rate (CMR)\nfor anorexia nervosa is approximately 5% per decade. Death most commonly results from\nmedical complications associated with the disorder itself or from suicide.Bulimia nervosa commonly begins in adolescence or young adulthood. Onset before pu-\nberty or after age 40 is uncommon. The binge eating frequently begins during or after an\nepisode of dieting to lose weight. Experiencing multiple stressful life events also can pre-\ncipitate onset of bulimia nervosa.\nDisturbed eating behavior persists for at least several years in a high percentage of\nclinic samples. The course may be chronic or intermittent, with periods of remission\nalternating with recurrences of binge eating. However, over longer-term follow-up, the\nsymptoms of many individuals appear to diminish with or without treatment, although\ntreatment clearly impacts outcome. Periods of remission longer than 1 year are associated\nwith better long-term outcome.\nSignificantly elevated risk for mortality (all-cause and suicide) has been reported for\nindividuals with bulimia nervosa. The CMR (crude mortality rate) for bulimia nervosa is\nnearly 2% per decade.\nDiagnostic cross-over from initial bulimia nervosa to anorexia nervosa occurs in a mi-\nnority of cases (10%–15%). Individuals who do experience cross-over to anorexia nervosa\ncommonly will revert back to bulimia nervosa or have multiple occurrences of cross-overs\nbetween these disorders. A subset of individuals with bulimia nervosa continue to binge\neat but no longer engage in inappropriate compensatory behaviors, and therefore their\n348\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\nsymptoms meet criteria for binge-eating disorder or other specified eating disorder. Diag-\nnosis should be based on the current (i.e., past 3 months) clinical presentation.Little is known about the development of binge-eating disorder. Both binge eating and\nloss-of-control eating without objectively excessive consumption occur in children and are\nassociated with increased body fat, weight gain, and increases in psychological symptoms.\nBinge eating is common in adolescent and college-age samples. Loss-of-control eating or\nepisodic binge eating may represent a prodromal phase of eating disorders for some indi-\nviduals.\nDieting follows the development of binge eating in many individuals with binge-\neating disorder. (This is in contrast to bulimia nervosa, in which dysfunctional dieting\nusually precedes the onset of binge eating.) Binge-eating disorder typically begins in ad-\nolescence or young adulthood but can begin in later adulthood. Individuals with binge-\neating disorder who seek treatment usually are older than individuals with either bulimia\nnervosa or anorexia nervosa who seek treatment.\nRemission rates in both natural course and treatment outcome studies are higher for\nbinge-eating disorder than for bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa. Binge-eating disorder\nappears to be relatively persistent, and the course is comparable to that of bulimia nervosa\nin terms of severity and duration. Crossover from binge-eating disorder to other eating\ndisorders is uncommon.Two types of course of enuresis have been described: a “primary” type, in which the indi-\nvidual has never established urinary continence, and a “secondary” type, in which the dis-\nturbance develops after a period of established urinary continence. There are no differences\nin prevalence of comorbid mental disorders between the two types. By definition, primary\nenuresis begins at age 5 years. The most common time for the onset of secondary enuresis\nis between ages 5 and 8 years, but it may occur at any time. After age 5 years, the rate of spon-\ntaneous remission is 5%–10% per year. Most children with the disorder become continent\nby adolescence, but in approximately 1% of cases the disorder continues into adulthood.\nDiurnal enuresis is uncommon after age 9 years. While occasional diurnal incontinence is\nnot uncommon in middle childhood, it is substantially more common in those who also\nhave persistent nocturnal enuresis. When enuresis persists into late childhood or adoles-\ncence, the frequency of incontinence may increase, whereas continence in early childhood\nis usually associated with a declining frequency of wet nights.Encopresis is not diagnosed until a child has reached a chronological age of at least 4 years\n(or for children with developmental delays, a mental age of at least 4 years). Inadequate,\ninconsistent toilet training and psychosocial stress (e.g., entering school, the birth of a sib-\nling) may be predisposing factors. Two types of course have been described: a “primary”\ntype, in which the individual has never established fecal continence, and a “secondary”\ntype, in which the disturbance develops after a period of established fecal continence. En-\ncopresis can persist, with intermittent exacerbations, for years.The onset of insomnia symptoms can occur at any time during life, but the first episode is\nmore common in young adulthood. Less frequently, insomnia begins in childhood or ad-\nolescence. In women, new-onset insomnia may occur during menopause and persist even\nafter other symptoms (e.g., hot flashes) have resolved. Insomnia may have a late-life onset,\nwhich is often associated with the onset of other health-related conditions.\nInsomnia can be situational, persistent, or recurrent. Situational or acute insomnia usu-\nally lasts a few days or a few weeks and is often associated with life events or rapid changes\nin sleep schedules or environment. It usually resolves once the initial precipitating event\nsubsides. For some individuals, perhaps those more vulnerable to sleep disturbances, in-\nsomnia may persist long after the initial triggering event, possibly because of conditioning\nfactors and heightened arousal. The factors that precipitate insomnia may differ from\nthose that perpetuate it. For example, an individual who is bedridden with a painful injury\nand has difficulty sleeping may then develop negative associations for sleep. Conditioned\narousal may then persist and lead to persistent insomnia. A similar course may develop in\nthe context of an acute psychological stress or a mental disorder. For instance, insomnia that\noccurs during an episode of major depressive disorder can become a focus of attention,\nwith consequent negative conditioning, and persist even after resolution of the depressive\nepisode. In some cases, insomnia may also have an insidious onset without any identifi-\nable precipitating factor.\nThe course of insomnia may also be episodic, with recurrent episodes of sleep difficul-\nties associated with the occurrence of stressful events. Chronicity rates range from 45%\nto 75% for follow-ups of 1–7 years. Even when the course of the insomnia has become\nchronic, there is night-to-night variability in sleep patterns, with an occasional restful night’s\nsleep interspersed with several nights of poor sleep. The characteristics of insomnia may\nalso change over time. Many individuals with insomnia have a history of “light” or easily\ndisturbed sleep prior to onset of more persistent sleep problems.\nInsomnia complaints are more prevalent among middle-age and older adults. The type\nof insomnia symptom changes as a function of age, with difficulties initiating sleep being\nmore common among young adults and problems maintaining sleep occurring more fre-\nquently among middle-age and older individuals.\nDifficulties initiating and maintaining sleep can also occur in children and adolescents,\nbut there are more limited data on prevalence, risk factors, and comorbidity during these\ndevelopmental phases of the lifespan. Sleep difficulties in childhood can result from con-\nditioning factors (e.g., a child who does not learn to fall asleep or return to sleep without\nthe presence of a parent) or from the absence of consistent sleep schedules and bedtime\nroutines. Insomnia in adolescence is often triggered or exacerbated by irregular sleep sched-\nules (e.g., phase delay). In both children and adolescents, psychological and medical fac-\ntors can contribute to insomnia.\nThe increased prevalence of insomnia in older adults is partly explained by the higher\nincidence of physical health problems with aging. Changes in sleep patterns associated with\nthe normal developmental process must be differentiated from those exceeding age-related\nchanges. Although polysomnography is of limited value in the routine evaluation of in-\nsomnia, it may be more useful in the differential diagnosis among older adults because the\netiologies of insomnia (e.g., sleep apnea) are more often identifiable in older individuals.\n366\nSleep-Wake DisordersHypersomnolence disorder has a persistent course, with a progressive evolution in the se-\nverity of symptoms. In most extreme cases, sleep episodes can last up to 20 hours. How-\never, the average nighttime sleep duration is around 9½ hours. While many individuals\nwith hypersomnolence are able to reduce their sleep time during working days, weekend\nand holiday sleep is greatly increased (by up to 3 hours). Awakenings are very difficult\nand accompanied by sleep inertia episodes in nearly 40% of cases. Hypersomnolence fully\nmanifests in most cases in late adolescence or early adulthood, with a mean age at onset of\n17–24 years. Individuals with hypersomnolence disorder are diagnosed, on average, 10–15\nyears after the appearance of the first symptoms. Pediatric cases are rare.\nHypersomnolence has a progressive onset, with symptoms beginning between ages 15\nand 25 years, with a gradual progression over weeks to months. For most individuals, the\ncourse is then persistent and stable, unless treatment is initiated. The development of other\nsleep disorders (e.g., breathing-related sleep disorder) may worsen the degree of sleepi-\nness. Although hyperactivity may be one of the presenting signs of daytime sleepiness in\nchildren, voluntary napping increases with age. This normal phenomenon is distinct from\nhypersomnolence.Onset is typically in children and adolescents/young adults but rarely in older adults.\nTwo peaks of onset are suggested, at ages 15–25 years and ages 30–35 years. Onset can be\nabrupt or progressive (over years). Severity is highest when onset is abrupt in children,\nand then decreases with age or with treatment, so that symptoms such as cataplexy can oc-\ncasionally disappear. Abrupt onset in young, prepubescent children can be associated\nwith obesity and premature puberty, a phenotype more frequently observed since 2009. In\nadolescents, onset is more difficult to pinpoint. Onset in adults is often unclear, with some\nindividuals reporting having had excessive sleepiness since birth. Once the disorder has\nmanifested, the course is persistent and lifelong.\nIn 90% of cases, the first symptom to manifest is sleepiness or increased sleep, followed\nby cataplexy (within 1 year in 50% of cases, within 3 years in 85%). Sleepiness, hypnagogic\nhallucinations, vivid dreaming, and REM sleep behavior disorder (excessive movements\nduring REM sleep) are early symptoms. Excessive sleep rapidly progresses to an inability\nto stay awake during the day, and to maintain good sleep at night, without a clear increase\nin total 24-hour sleep needs. In the first months, cataplexy may be atypical, especially in\nchildren. Sleep paralysis usually develops around puberty in children with prepubertal\nonset. Exacerbations of symptoms suggest lack of compliance with medications or devel-\nopment of a concurrent sleep disorder, notably sleep apnea.\nYoung children and adolescents with narcolepsy often develop aggression or behav-\nioral problems secondary to sleepiness and/or nighttime sleep disruption. Workload and\nsocial pressure increase through high school and college, reducing available sleep time at\nnight. Pregnancy does not seem to modify symptoms consistently. After retirement, indi-\nviduals typically have more opportunity for napping, reducing the need for stimulants.\nMaintaining a regular schedule benefits individuals at all ages.The age distribution of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea likely follows a J-shaped distri-\nbution. There is a peak in children ages 3–8 years when the nasopharynx may be compro-\nmised by a relatively large mass of tonsillar tissue compared with the size of the upper\n380\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nairway. With growth of the airway and regression of lymphoid tissue during later child-\nhood, there is reduction in prevalence. Then, as obesity prevalence increases in midlife and\nfemales enter menopause, obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea again increases. The course\nin older age is unclear; the disorder may level off after age 65 years, but in other individ-\nuals, prevalence may increase with aging. Because there is some age dependency of the oc-\ncurrence of apneas and hypopneas, polysomnographic results must be interpreted in light\nof other clinical data. In particular, significant clinical symptoms of insomnia or hyper-\nsomnia should be investigated regardless of the individual’s age.\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea usually has an insidious onset, gradual progression,\nand persistent course. Typically the loud snoring has been present for many years, often since\nchildhood, but an increase in its severity may lead the individual to seek evaluation. Weight\ngain may precipitate an increase in symptoms. Although obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea\ncan occur at any age, it most commonly manifests among individuals ages 40–60 years. Over\n4–5 years, the average apnea hypopnea index increases in adults and older individuals by ap-\nproximately two apneas/hypopneas per hour. The apnea hypopnea index is increased and in-\ncident obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is greater among individuals who are older, who are\nmale, or who have a higher baseline body mass index (BMI) or increase their BMI over time.\nSpontaneous resolution of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea has been reported with weight\nloss, particularly after bariatric surgery. In children, seasonal variation in obstructive sleep ap-\nnea hypopnea has been observed, as has improvement with overall growth.\nIn young children, the signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea may be\nmore subtle than in adults, making diagnosis more difficult to establish. Polysomnography is\nuseful in confirming diagnosis. Evidence of fragmentation of sleep on the polysomnogram\nmay not be as apparent as in studies of older individuals, possibly because of the high homeo-\nstatic drive in young individuals. Symptoms such as snoring are usually parent-reported and\nthus have reduced sensitivity. Agitated arousals and unusual sleep postures, such as sleeping\non the hands and knees, may occur. Nocturnal enuresis also may occur and should raise the\nsuspicion of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea if it recurs in a child who was previously dry at\nnight. Children may also manifest excessive daytime sleepiness, although this is not as com-\nmon or pronounced as in adults. Daytime mouth breathing, difficulty in swallowing, and poor\nspeech articulation are also common features in children. Children younger than 5 years more\noften present with nighttime symptoms, such as observed apneas or labored breathing, than\nwith behavioral symptoms (i.e., the nighttime symptoms are more noticeable and more often\nbring the child to clinical attention). In children older than 5 years, daytime symptoms such as\nsleepiness and behavioral problems (e.g., impulsivity and hyperactivity), attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder, learning difficulties, and morning headaches are more often the focus\nof concern. Children with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea also may present with failure to\nthrive and developmental delays. In young children, obesity is a less common risk factor,\nwhile delayed growth and “failure to thrive” may be present.The onset of Cheyne-Stokes breathing appears tied to the development of heart failure. The\nCheyne-Stokes breathing pattern is associated with oscillations in heart rate, blood pres-\nsure and oxygen desaturation, and elevated sympathetic nervous system activity that can\npromote progression of heart failure. The clinical significance of Cheyne-Stokes breathing\nin the setting of stroke is not known, but Cheyne-Stokes breathing may be a transient find-\ning that resolves with time after acute stroke. Central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid\nuse has been documented with chronic use (i.e., several months).Idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation is thought to be a slowly progressive disorder of\nrespiratory impairment. When this disorder occurs comorbidly with other disorders (e.g.,\nCOPD, neuromuscular disorders, obesity), disease severity reflects the severity of the un-\nderlying condition, and the disorder progresses as the condition worsens. Complications\nsuch as pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, cardiac dysrhythmias, polycythemia,\nneurocognitive dysfunction, and worsening respiratory failure can develop with increas-\ning severity of blood gas abnormalities.\nCongenital central alveolar hypoventilation usually manifests at birth with shallow,\nerratic, or absent breathing. This disorder can also manifest during infancy, childhood,\nand adulthood because of variable penetrance of the PHOX2B mutation. Children with\ncongenital central alveolar hypoventilation are more likely to have disorders of the auto-\nnomic nervous system, Hirschsprung’s disease, neural crest tumors, and characteristic box-\nshaped face (i.e., the face is short relative to its width).Course is persistent, lasting longer than 3 months, with intermittent exacerbations through-\nout adulthood. Although age at onset is variable, symptoms begin typically in adolescence\nand early adulthood and persist for several months to years before diagnosis is estab-\nlished. Severity may decrease with age. Relapse of symptoms is common.\nClinical expression may vary across the lifespan depending on social, school, and work\nobligations. Exacerbation is usually triggered by a change in work or school schedule that\nrequires an early rise time. Individuals who can alter their work schedules to accommo-\ndate the delayed circadian sleep and wake timing can experience remission of symptoms.\nIncreased prevalence in adolescence may be a consequence of both physiological and be-\nhavioral factors. Hormonal changes may be involved specifically, as delayed sleep phase is as-\nsociated with the onset of puberty. Thus, delayed sleep phase type in adolescents should be\ndifferentiated from the common delay in the timing of circadian rhythms in this age group. In\nthe familial form, the course is persistent and may not improve significantly with age.\n392\nSleep-Wake DisordersOnset is usually in late adulthood. In the familial form, onset can be earlier. The course is typ-\nically persistent, lasting more than 3 months, but the severity may increase depending on work\nand social schedules. The advanced sleep phase type is more common in older adults.\nClinical expression may vary across the lifespan depending on social, school, and work\nobligations. Individuals who can alter their work schedules to accommodate the advanced\ncircadian sleep and wake timing can experience remission of symptoms. Increasing age\ntends to advance the sleep phase, however, it is unclear whether the common age-associ-\nated advanced sleep phase type is due solely to a change in circadian timing (as seen in the\nfamilial form) or also to age-related changes in the homeostatic regulation of sleep, result-\ning in earlier awakening. Severity, remission, and relapse of symptoms suggest lack of ad-\nherence to behavioral and environmental treatments designed to control sleep and wake\nstructure and light exposure.\n394\nSleep-Wake DisordersThe course of irregular sleep-wake type is persistent. Age at onset is variable, but the dis-\norder is more common in older adults.Course of non-24-hour sleep-wake type is persistent, with intermittent remission and ex-\nacerbations due to changes in work and social schedules throughout the lifespan. Age at\nonset is variable, depending on the onset of visual impairment. In sighted individuals, be-\ncause of the overlap with delayed sleep phase type, non-24-hour sleep-wake type may de-\nvelop in adolescence or early adulthood. Remission and relapse of symptoms in blind and\nsighted individuals largely depend on adherence to treatments designed to control sleep\nand wake structure and light exposure.\nClinical expression may vary across the lifespan depending on social, school, and work\nobligations. In adolescents and adults, irregular sleep-wake schedules and exposure to\nlight or lack of light at critical times of the day can exacerbate the effects of sleep loss and\ndisrupt circadian entrainment. Consequently, symptoms of insomnia, daytime sleepiness,\nand school, professional, and interpersonal functioning may worsen.Shift work type can appear in individuals of any age but is more prevalent in individuals\nolder than 50 years and typically worsens with the passage of time if the disruptive work\nhours persist. Although older adults may show similar rates of circadian phase adjust-\nment to a change in routine as do younger adults, they appear to experience significantly\nmore sleep disruption as a consequence of the circadian phase shift.NREM sleep arousal disorders occur most commonly in childhood and diminish in fre-\nquency with increasing age. The onset of sleepwalking in adults with no prior history of\nsleepwalking as children should prompt a search for specific etiologies, such as obstruc-\ntive sleep apnea, nocturnal seizures, or effect of medication.Nightmares often begin between ages 3 and 6 years but reach a peak prevalence and se-\nverity in late adolescence or early adulthood. Nightmares most likely appear in children\nexposed to acute or chronic psychosocial stressors and thus may not resolve spontane-\nously. In a minority, frequent nightmares persist into adulthood, becoming virtually a life-\nlong disturbance. Although specific nightmare content may reflect the individual’s age,\nthe essential features of the disorder are the same across age groups.The onset of REM sleep behavior disorder may be gradual or rapid, and the course is usu-\nally progressive. REM sleep behavior disorder associated with neurodegenerative disor-\nders may improve as the underlying neurodegenerative disorder progresses. Because of\nthe very high association with the later appearance of an underlying neurodegenerative\ndisorder, most notably one of the synucleinopathies (Parkinson’s disease, multiple system\natrophy, or major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies), the neurological\nstatus of individuals with REM sleep behavior disorder should be closely monitored.\nREM sleep behavior disorder overwhelmingly affects males older than 50 years, but in-\ncreasingly this disorder is being identified in females and in younger individuals. Symp-\nRapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder\n409\ntoms in young individuals, particularly young females, should raise the possibility of\nnarcolepsy or medication-induced REM sleep behavior disorder.The onset of RLS typically occurs in the second or third decade. Approximately 40% of in-\ndividuals diagnosed with RLS during adulthood report having experienced symptoms\nbefore age 20 years, and 20% report having experienced symptoms before age 10 years.Insomnia in children can be identified by either a parent or the child. Often the child has a\nclear sleep disturbance associated with initiation of a medication but may not report\nsymptoms, although parents observe the sleep disturbances. The use of some illicit sub-\nstances (e.g., cannabis, ecstasy) is prevalent in adolescence and early adulthood. Insomnia\nor any other sleep disturbance encountered in this age group should prompt careful con-\nsideration of whether the sleep disturbance is due to consumption of these substances.\nHelp-seeking behavior for the sleep disturbance in these age groups is limited, and thus\ncorroborative report may be elicited from a parent, caregiver, or teacher. Older individuals\ntake more medications and are at increased risk for developing a substance/medication-\ninduced sleep disorder. They may interpret sleep disturbance as part of normal aging and\nfail to report symptoms. Individuals with major neurocognitive disorder (e.g., dementia)\nare at risk for substance/medication-induced sleep disorders but may not report symp-\ntoms, making corroborative report from caregiver(s) particularly important.Lifelong delayed ejaculation begins with early sexual experiences and continues through-\nout life. By definition, acquired delayed ejaculation begins after a period of normal sexual\nfunction. There is minimal evidence concerning the course of acquired delayed ejacula-\ntion. The prevalence of delayed ejaculation appears to remain relatively constant until\naround age 50 years, when the incidence begins to increase significantly. Men in their 80s\nreport twice as much difficulty ejaculating as men younger than 59 years.Erectile failure on first sexual attempt has been found to be related to having sex with a pre-\nviously unknown partner, concomitant use of drugs or alcohol, not wanting to have sex, and\npeer pressure. There is minimal evidence regarding the persistence of such problems after\nthe first attempt. It is assumed that most of these problems spontaneously remit without pro-\nfessional intervention, but some men may continue to have episodic problems. In contrast,\nacquired erectile disorder is often associated with biological factors such as diabetes and car-\ndiovascular disease. Acquired erectile disorder is likely to be persistent in most men.\nThe natural history of lifelong erectile disorder is unknown. Clinical observation sup-\nports the association of lifelong erectile disorder with psychological factors that are self-\n428\nSexual Dysfunctions\nlimiting or responsive to psychological interventions, whereas, as noted above, acquired\nerectile disorder is more likely to be related to biological factors and to be persistent. The\nincidence of erectile disorder increases with age. A minority of men diagnosed as having\nmoderate erectile failure may experience spontaneous remission of symptoms without\nmedical intervention. Distress associated with erectile disorder is lower in older men as\ncompared with younger men.By definition, lifelong female orgasmic disorder indicates that the orgasmic difficulties have\nalways been present, whereas the acquired subtype would be assigned if the woman’s or-\ngasmic difficulties developed after a period of normal orgasmic functioning.\nA woman’s first experience of orgasm can occur any time from the prepubertal period\nto well into adulthood. Women show a more variable pattern in age at first orgasm than do\nmen, and women’s reports of having experienced orgasm increase with age. Many women\nlearn to experience orgasm as they experience a wide variety of stimulation and acquire\nmore knowledge about their bodies. Women’s rates of orgasm consistency (defined as\n“usually or always” experiencing orgasm) are higher during masturbation than during\nsexual activity with a partner.By definition, lifelong female sexual interest/arousal disorder suggests that the lack of\nsexual interest or arousal has been present for the woman’s entire sexual life. For Criteria\nA3, A4, and A6, which assess functioning during sexual activity, a subtype of lifelong\nwould mean presence of symptoms since the individual’s first sexual experiences. The ac-\nquired subtype would be assigned if the difficulties with sexual interest or arousal de-\nveloped after a period of nonproblematic sexual functioning. Adaptive and normative\nchanges in sexual functioning may result from partner-related, interpersonal, or personal\nevents and may be transient in nature. However, persistence of symptoms for approxi-\nmately 6 months or more would constitute a sexual dysfunction.\nThere are normative changes in sexual interest and arousal across the life span. Fur-\nthermore, women in relationships of longer duration are more likely to report engaging in\nsex despite no obvious feelings of sexual desire at the outset of a sexual encounter com-\npared with women in shorter-duration relationships. Vaginal dryness in older women is\nrelated to age and menopausal status.The development and course of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder is unclear. Because\nwomen generally do not seek treatment until they experience problems in sexual functioning,\nit can, in general, be difficult to characterize genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder as life-\nlong (primary) or acquired (secondary). Although women typically come to clinical atten-\ntion after the initiation of sexual activity, there are often earlier clinical signs. For example,\ndifficulty with or the avoidance of use of tampons is an important predictor of later problems.\nDifficulties with vaginal penetration (inability or fear or pain) may not be obvious until sex-\nual intercourse is attempted. Even once intercourse is attempted, the frequency of attempts\nmay not be significant or regular. In cases where it is difficult to establish whether symptom-\natology is lifelong or acquired, it is useful to determine the presence of any consistent period\nof successful pain-, fear-, and tension-free intercourse. If the experience of such a period can\nbe established, then genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder can be characterized as ac-\nquired. Once symptomatology is well established for a period of approximately 6 months,\nthe probability of spontaneous and significant symptomatic remission appears to diminish.\nComplaints related to genito-pelvic pain peak during early adulthood and in the peri-\nand postmenopausal period. Women with complaints about difficulty having intercourse\nappear to be primarily premenopausal. There may also be an increase in genito-pelvic\npain–related symptoms in the postpartum period.By definition, lifelong male hypoactive sexual desire disorder indicates that low or no sex-\nual desire has always been present, whereas the acquired subtype would be assigned if the\nman’s low desire developed after a period of normal sexual desire. There is a requirement\nthat low desire persist for approximately 6 months or more; thus, short-term changes in\nsexual desire should not be diagnosed as male hypoactive sexual desire disorder.\nThere is a normative age-related decline in sexual desire. Like women, men identify a\nvariety of triggers for their sexual desire, and they describe a wide range of reasons that\nthey choose to engage in sexual activity. Although erotic visual cues may be more potent\nelicitors of desire in younger men, the potency of sexual cues may decrease with age and\nmust be considered when evaluating men for hypoactive sexual desire disorder.By definition, lifelong premature (early) ejaculation starts during a male’s initial sexual ex-\nperiences and persists thereafter. Some men may experience premature (early) ejaculation\nduring their initial sexual encounters but gain ejaculatory control over time. It is the persis-\ntence of ejaculatory problems for longer than 6 months that determines the diagnosis of pre-\nmature (early) ejaculation. In contrast, some men develop the disorder after a period of\nPremature (Early) Ejaculation\n445\nhaving a normal ejaculatory latency, known as acquired premature (early) ejaculation. There is\nfar less known about acquired premature (early) ejaculation than about lifelong premature\n(early) ejaculation. The acquired form likely has a later onset, usually appearing during or af-\nter the fourth decade of life. Lifelong is relatively stable throughout life. Little is known about\nthe course of acquired premature (early) ejaculation. Reversal of medical conditions such as\nhyperthyroidism and prostatitis appears to restore ejaculatory latencies to baseline values.\nLifelong premature (early) ejaculation begins with early sexual experiences and persists\nthroughout an individual’s life. In approximately 20% of men with premature (early) ejacu-\nlation, ejaculatory latencies decrease further with age. Age and relationship length have been\nfound to be negatively associated with prevalence of premature (early) ejaculation.The onset of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction may be as early as 8 days after the\nagent is first taken. Approximately 30% of individuals with mild to moderate orgasm de-\nlay will experience spontaneous remission of the dysfunction within 6 months. In some\ncases, serotonin reuptake inhibitor–induced sexual dysfunction may persist after the\nagent is discontinued. The time to onset of sexual dysfunction after initiation of antipsy-\nchotic drugs or drugs of abuse is unknown. It is probable that the adverse effects of nico-\ntine and alcohol may not appear until after years of use. Premature (early) ejaculation can\nsometimes occur after cessation of opioid use. There is some evidence that disturbances in\nsexual function related to substance/medication use increase with age.Because expression of gender dysphoria varies with age, there are separate criteria sets for\nchildren versus adolescents and adults. Criteria for children are defined in a more con-\nGender Dysphoria\n455\ncrete, behavioral manner than those for adolescents and adults. Many of the core criteria\ndraw on well-documented behavioral gender differences between typically developing\nboys and girls. Young children are less likely than older children, adolescents, and adults\nto express extreme and persistent anatomic dysphoria. In adolescents and adults, incon-\ngruence between experienced gender and somatic sex is a central feature of the diagnosis.\nFactors related to distress and impairment also vary with age. A very young child may\nshow signs of distress (e.g., intense crying) only when parents tell the child that he or she\nis “really” not a member of the other gender but only “desires” to be. Distress may not be\nmanifest in social environments supportive of the child’s desire to live in the role of the\nother gender and may emerge only if the desire is interfered with. In adolescents and\nadults, distress may manifest because of strong incongruence between experienced gender\nand somatic sex. Such distress may, however, be mitigated by supportive environments and\nknowledge that biomedical treatments exist to reduce incongruence. Impairment (e.g.,\nschool refusal, development of depression, anxiety, and substance abuse) may be a conse-\nquence of gender dysphoria.\nGender dysphoria without a disorder of sex development.\nFor clinic-referred children,\nonset of cross-gender behaviors is usually between ages 2 and 4 years. This corresponds to\nthe developmental time period in which most typically developing children begin ex-\npressing gendered behaviors and interests. For some preschool-age children, both perva-\nsive cross-gender behaviors and the expressed desire to be the other gender may be\npresent, or, more rarely, labeling oneself as a member of the other gender may occur. In\nsome cases, the expressed desire to be the other gender appears later, usually at entry into\nelementary school. A small minority of children express discomfort with their sexual anat-\nomy or will state the desire to have a sexual anatomy corresponding to the experienced\ngender (“anatomic dysphoria”). Expressions of anatomic dysphoria become more com-\nmon as children with gender dysphoria approach and anticipate puberty.\nRates of persistence of gender dysphoria from childhood into adolescence or adulthood\nvary. In natal males, persistence has ranged from 2.2% to 30%. In natal females, persistence\nhas ranged from 12% to 50%. Persistence of gender dysphoria is modestly correlated with\ndimensional measures of severity ascertained at the time of a childhood baseline assess-\nment. In one sample of natal males, lower socioeconomic background was also modestly\ncorrelated with persistence. It is unclear if particular therapeutic approaches to gender\ndysphoria in children are related to rates of long-term persistence. Extant follow-up sam-\nples consisted of children receiving no formal therapeutic intervention or receiving ther-\napeutic interventions of various types, ranging from active efforts to reduce gender\ndysphoria to a more neutral, “watchful waiting” approach. It is unclear if children “en-\ncouraged” or supported to live socially in the desired gender will show higher rates of per-\nsistence, since such children have not yet been followed longitudinally in a systematic\nmanner. For both natal male and female children showing persistence, almost all are\nsexually attracted to individuals of their natal sex. For natal male children whose gender\ndysphoria does not persist, the majority are androphilic (sexually attracted to males) and of-\nten self-identify as gay or homosexual (ranging from 63% to 100%). In natal female chil-\ndren whose gender dysphoria does not persist, the percentage who are gynephilic (sexually\nattracted to females) and self-identify as lesbian is lower (ranging from 32% to 50%).\nIn both adolescent and adult natal males, there are two broad trajectories for develop-\nment of gender dysphoria: early onset and late onset. Early-onset gender dysphoria starts in\nchildhood and continues into adolescence and adulthood; or, there is an intermittent pe-\nriod in which the gender dysphoria desists and these individuals self-identify as gay or ho-\nmosexual, followed by recurrence of gender dysphoria. Late-onset gender dysphoria occurs\naround puberty or much later in life. Some of these individuals report having had a desire\nto be of the other gender in childhood that was not expressed verbally to others. Others do\nnot recall any signs of childhood gender dysphoria. For adolescent males with late-onset\ngender dysphoria, parents often report surprise because they did not see signs of gender\n456\nGender Dysphoria\ndysphoria during childhood. Expressions of anatomic dysphoria are more common and\nsalient in adolescents and adults once secondary sex characteristics have developed.\nAdolescent and adult natal males with early-onset gender dysphoria are almost al-\nways sexually attracted to men (androphilic). Adolescents and adults with late-onset gen-\nder dysphoria frequently engage in transvestic behavior with sexual excitement. The\nmajority of these individuals are gynephilic or sexually attracted to other posttransition\nnatal males with late-onset gender dysphoria. A substantial percentage of adult males\nwith late-onset gender dysphoria cohabit with or are married to natal females. After gen-\nder transition, many self-identify as lesbian. Among adult natal males with gender dyspho-\nria, the early-onset group seeks out clinical care for hormone treatment and reassignment\nsurgery at an earlier age than does the late-onset group. The late-onset group may have more\nfluctuations in the degree of gender dysphoria and be more ambivalent about and less\nlikely satisfied after gender reassignment surgery.\nIn both adolescent and adult natal females, the most common course is the early-onset\nform of gender dysphoria. The late-onset form is much less common in natal females com-\npared with natal males. As in natal males with gender dysphoria, there may have been a\nperiod in which the gender dysphoria desisted and these individuals self-identified as les-\nbian; however, with recurrence of gender dysphoria, clinical consultation is sought, often\nwith the desire for hormone treatment and reassignment surgery. Parents of natal adoles-\ncent females with the late-onset form also report surprise, as no signs of childhood gender\ndysphoria were evident. Expressions of anatomic dysphoria are much more common and\nsalient in adolescents and adults than in children.\nAdolescent and adult natal females with early-onset gender dysphoria are almost\nalways gynephilic. Adolescents and adults with the late-onset form of gender dysphoria\nare usually androphilic and after gender transition self-identify as gay men. Natal females\nwith the late-onset form do not have co-occurring transvestic behavior with sexual ex-\ncitement.\nGender dysphoria in association with a disorder of sex development.\nMost individuals\nwith a disorder of sex development who develop gender dysphoria have already come to\nmedical attention at an early age. For many, starting at birth, issues of gender assignment\nwere raised by physicians and parents. Moreover, as infertility is quite common for this\ngroup, physicians are more willing to perform cross-sex hormone treatments and genital\nsurgery before adulthood.\nDisorders of sex development in general are frequently associated with gender-atypi-\ncal behavior starting in early childhood. However, in the majority of cases, this does not\nlead to gender dysphoria. As individuals with a disorder of sex development become\naware of their medical history and condition, many experience uncertainty about their\ngender, as opposed to developing a firm conviction that they are another gender. How-\never, most do not progress to gender transition. Gender dysphoria and gender transition\nmay vary considerably as a function of a disorder of sex development, its severity, and as-\nsigned gender.The first symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder usually appear during the preschool\nyears and rarely later than early adolescence. Oppositional defiant disorder often precedes\nthe development of conduct disorder, especially for those with the childhood-onset type\nof conduct disorder. However, many children and adolescents with oppositional defiant\ndisorder do not subsequently develop conduct disorder. Oppositional defiant disorder\nalso conveys risk for the development of anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder,\neven in the absence of conduct disorder. The defiant, argumentative, and vindictive symp-\ntoms carry most of the risk for conduct disorder, whereas the angry-irritable mood symp-\ntoms carry most of the risk for emotional disorders.\nManifestations of the disorder across development appear consistent. Children and\nadolescents with oppositional defiant disorder are at increased risk for a number of prob-\nlems in adjustment as adults, including antisocial behavior, impulse-control problems,\nsubstance abuse, anxiety, and depression.\nMany of the behaviors associated with oppositional defiant disorder increase in fre-\nquency during the preschool period and in adolescence. Thus, it is especially critical dur-\ning these development periods that the frequency and intensity of these behaviors be\nevaluated against normative levels before it is decided that they are symptoms of opposi-\ntional defiant disorder.\nRisk and Prognostic Features\nTemperamental.\nTemperamental factors related to problems in emotional regulation\n(e.g., high levels of emotional reactivity, poor frustration tolerance) have been predictive\nof the disorder.\nEnvironmental.\nHarsh, inconsistent, or neglectful child-rearing practices are common in\nfamilies of children and adolescents with oppositional defiant disorder, and these parent-\ning practices play an important role in many causal theories of the disorder.\nGenetic and physiological.\nA number of neurobiological markers (e.g., lower heart rate\nand skin conductance reactivity; reduced basal cortisol reactivity; abnormalities in the pre-\nfrontal cortex and amygdala) have been associated with oppositional defiant disorder.\nHowever, the vast majority of studies have not separated children with oppositional de-\nfiant disorder from those with conduct disorder. Thus, it is unclear whether there are\nmarkers specific to oppositional defiant disorder.\nOppositional Defiant Disorder\n465The onset of recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive behavior is most common in late\nchildhood or adolescence and rarely begins for the first time after age 40 years. The core\nfeatures of intermittent explosive disorder, typically, are persistent and continue for many\nyears.\nThe course of the disorder may be episodic, with recurrent periods of impulsive ag-\ngressive outbursts. Intermittent explosive disorder appears to follow a chronic and persis-\ntent course over many years. It also appears to be quite common regardless of the presence\nor absence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or disruptive, impulse-\ncontrol, and conduct disorders (e.g., conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder).The onset of conduct disorder may occur as early as the preschool years, but the first sig-\nnificant symptoms usually emerge during the period from middle childhood through\nmiddle adolescence. Oppositional defiant disorder is a common precursor to the child-\nhood-onset type of conduct disorder. Conduct disorder may be diagnosed in adults, how-\never, symptoms of conduct disorder usually emerge in childhood or adolescence, and\nonset is rare after age 16 years. The course of conduct disorder after onset is variable. In a\nmajority of individuals, the disorder remits by adulthood. Many individuals with conduct\ndisorder—particularly those with adolescent-onset type and those with few and milder\nsymptoms—achieve adequate social and occupational adjustment as adults. However, the\nearly-onset type predicts a worse prognosis and an increased risk of criminal behavior,\nconduct disorder, and substance-related disorders in adulthood. Individuals with conduct\ndisorder are at risk for later mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress dis-\norder, impulse-control disorders, psychotic disorders, somatic symptom disorders, and\nsubstance-related disorders as adults.\nSymptoms of the disorder vary with age as the individual develops increased physical\nstrength, cognitive abilities, and sexual maturity. Symptom behaviors that emerge first\ntend to be less serious (e.g., lying, shoplifting), whereas conduct problems that emerge last\ntend to be more severe (e.g., rape, theft while confronting a victim). However, there are\nwide differences among individuals, with some engaging in the more damaging behaviors\nat an early age (which is predictive of a worse prognosis). When individuals with conduct\ndisorder reach adulthood, symptoms of aggression, property destruction, deceitfulness,\nand rule violation, including violence against co-workers, partners, and children, may be ex-\nhibited in the workplace and the home, such that antisocial personality disorder may be\nconsidered.There are insufficient data to establish a typical age at onset of pyromania. The relation-\nship between fire setting in childhood and pyromania in adulthood has not been docu-\nmented. In individuals with pyromania, fire-setting incidents are episodic and may wax\nand wane in frequency. Longitudinal course is unknown. Although fire setting is a major\nproblem in children and adolescents (over 40% of those arrested for arson offenses in the\nUnited States are younger than 18 years), pyromania in childhood appears to be rare. Ju-\nvenile fire setting is usually associated with conduct disorder, attention-deficit/hyperac-\ntivity disorder, or an adjustment disorder.Age at onset of kleptomania is variable, but the disorder often begins in adolescence. How-\never, the disorder may begin in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood, and in rare cases\nin late adulthood. There is little systematic information on the course of kleptomania, but\nthree typical courses have been described: sporadic with brief episodes and long periods\nof remission; episodic with protracted periods of stealing and periods of remission; and\nchronic with some degree of fluctuation. The disorder may continue for years, despite\nmultiple convictions for shoplifting.\nOther Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder\n479Individuals ages 18–24 years have relatively high prevalence rates for the use of virtually\nevery substance. Intoxication is usually the initial substance-related disorder and often be-\ngins in the teens. Withdrawal can occur at any age as long as the relevant drug has been\ntaken in sufficient doses over an extended period of time.Substance-induced mental disorders develop in the context of intoxication or withdrawal\nfrom substances of abuse, and medication-induced mental disorders are seen with pre-\nscribed or over-the-counter medications that are taken at the suggested doses. Both condi-\ntions are usually temporary and likely to disappear within 1 month or so of cessation of acute\nwithdrawal, severe intoxication, or use of the medication. Exceptions to these generaliza-\ntions occur for certain long-duration substance-induced disorders: substance-associated\nneurocognitive disorders that relate to conditions such as alcohol-induced neurocognitive\ndisorder, inhalant-induced neurocognitive disorder, and sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-\ninduced neurocognitive disorder; and hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (“flash-\nbacks”; see the section “Hallucinogen-Related Disorders” later in this chapter). However,\nmost other substance/medication-induced mental disorders, regardless of the severity of\nthe symptoms, are likely to improve relatively quickly with abstinence and unlikely to re-\nmain clinically relevant for more than 1 month after complete cessation of use.\nAs is true of many consequences of heavy substance use, some individuals are more\nand others less prone toward specific substance-induced disorders. Similar types of pre-\ndispositions may make some individuals more likely to develop psychiatric side effects of\nsome types of medications, but not others. However, it is unclear whether individuals\nwith family histories or personal prior histories with independent psychiatric syndromes\nare more likely to develop the induced syndrome once the consideration is made as to\nwhether the quantity and frequency of the substance was sufficient to lead to the devel-\nopment of a substance-induced syndrome.\nThere are indications that the intake of substances of abuse or some medications with\npsychiatric side effects in the context of a preexisting mental disorder is likely to result in\nan intensification of the preexisting independent syndrome. The risk for substance/med-\nication-induced mental disorders is likely to increase with both the quantity and the fre-\nquency of consumption of the relevant substance.\nThe symptom profiles for the substance/medication-induced mental disorders resem-\nble independent mental disorders. While the symptoms of substance/medication-in-\nduced mental disorders can be identical to those of independent mental disorders (e.g.,\ndelusions, hallucinations, psychoses, major depressive episodes, anxiety syndromes), and\nalthough they can have the same severe consequences (e.g., suicide), most induced mental\ndisorders are likely to improve in a matter of days to weeks of abstinence.\nThe substance/medication-induced mental disorders are an important part of the dif-\nferential diagnoses for the independent psychiatric conditions. The importance of recog-\nnizing an induced mental disorder is similar to the relevance of identifying the possible\nrole of some medical conditions and medication reactions before diagnosing an indepen-\ndent mental disorder. Symptoms of substance- and medication-induced mental disorders\nmay be identical cross-sectionally to those of independent mental disorders but have dif-\nferent treatments and prognoses from the independent condition.\n490\nSubstance-Related and Addictive Disorders", "risk_factors": "Environmental.\nPrematurity or very low birth weight increases the risk for specific\nlearning disorder, as does prenatal exposure to nicotine.\nGenetic and physiological.\nSpecific learning disorder appears to aggregate in families,\nparticularly when affecting reading, mathematics, and spelling. The relative risk of spe-\ncific learning disorder in reading or mathematics is substantially higher (e.g., 4–8 times\nand 5–10 times higher, respectively) in first-degree relatives of individuals with these\nlearning difficulties compared with those without them. Family history of reading diffi-\nculties (dyslexia) and parental literacy skills predict literacy problems or specific learning\ndisorder in offspring, indicating the combined role of genetic and environmental factors.\nThere is high heritability for both reading ability and reading disability in alphabetic and\nnonalphabetic languages, including high heritability for most manifestations of learning abil-\nities and disabilities (e.g., heritability estimate values greater than 0.6). Covariation between\nvarious manifestations of learning difficulties is high, suggesting that genes related to one\npresentation are highly correlated with genes related to another manifestation.\nCourse modifiers.\nMarked problems with inattentive behavior in preschool years is pre-\ndictive of later difficulties in reading and mathematics (but not necessarily specific learn-\ning disorder) and nonresponse to effective academic interventions. Delay or disorders in\nspeech or language, or impaired cognitive processing (e.g., phonological awareness,\nworking memory, rapid serial naming) in preschool years, predicts later specific learning\ndisorder in reading and written expression. Comorbidity with ADHD is predictive of\nworse mental health outcome than that associated with specific learning disorder without\nADHD. Systematic, intensive, individualized instruction, using evidence-based interven-\ntions, may improve or ameliorate the learning difficulties in some individuals or promote\nthe use of compensatory strategies in others, thereby mitigating the otherwise poor out-\ncomes.Environmental.\nDevelopmental coordination disorder is more common following pre-\nnatal exposure to alcohol and in preterm and low-birth-weight children.\nGenetic and physiological.\nImpairments in underlying neurodevelopmental processes—\nparticularly in visual-motor skills, both in visual-motor perception and spatial mentalizing—\nhave been found and affect the ability to make rapid motoric adjustments as the complexity of\nthe required movements increases. Cerebellar dysfunction has been proposed, but the neural\nbasis of developmental coordination disorder remains unclear. Because of the co-occurrence of\ndevelopmental coordination disorder with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),\nspecific learning disabilities, and autism spectrum disorder, shared genetic effect has been pro-\nposed. However, consistent co-occurrence in twins appears only in severe cases.\nCourse modifiers.\nIndividuals with ADHD and with developmental coordination dis-\norder demonstrate more impairment than individuals with ADHD without developmen-\ntal coordination disorder.Environmental.\nSocial isolation is a risk factor for self-stimulation that may progress to\nstereotypic movements with repetitive self-injury. Environmental stress may also trigger\nstereotypic behavior. Fear may alter physiological state, resulting in increased frequency\nof stereotypic behaviors.\nGenetic and physiological.\nLower cognitive functioning is linked to greater risk for stereo-\ntypic behaviors and poorer response to interventions. Stereotypic movements are more fre-\nquent among individuals with moderate-to-severe/profound intellectual disability, who by\nvirtue of a particular syndrome (e.g., Rett syndrome) or environmental factor (e.g., an environ-\nment with relatively insufficient stimulation) seem to be at higher risk for stereotypies. Repet-\nitive self-injurious behavior may be a behavioral phenotype in neurogenetic syndromes. For\nexample, in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, there are both stereotypic dystonic movements and self-\nmutilation of fingers, lip biting, and other forms of self-injury unless the individual is re-\nstrained, and in Rett syndrome and Cornelia de Lange syndrome, self-injury may result from\nthe hand-to-mouth stereotypies. Stereotypic behaviors may result from a painful medical con-\ndition (e.g., middle ear infection, dental problems, gastroesophageal reflux).Temperamental.\nTics are worsened by anxiety, excitement, and exhaustion and are better\nduring calm, focused activities. Individuals may have fewer tics when engaged in schoolwork\nor tasks at work than when relaxing at home after school or in the evening. Stressful/exciting\nevents (e.g., taking a test, participating in exciting activities) often make tics worse.\nEnvironmental.\nObserving a gesture or sound in another person may result in an indi-\nvidual with a tic disorder making a similar gesture or sound, which may be incorrectly\nperceived by others as purposeful. This can be a particular problem when the individual is\ninteracting with authority figures (e.g., teachers, supervisors, police).\nGenetic and physiological.\nGenetic and environmental factors influence tic symptom\nexpression and severity. Important risk alleles for Tourette’s disorder and rare genetic\nvariants in families with tic disorders have been identified. Obstetrical complications,\nolder paternal age, lower birth weight, and maternal smoking during pregnancy are as-\nsociated with worse tic severity.Temperamental.\nPreexisting personality disorders and traits (e.g., schizotypal person-\nality disorder; borderline personality disorder; or traits in the psychoticism domain, such\nas perceptual dysregulation, and the negative affectivity domain, such as suspiciousness)\nmay predispose the individual to the development of the disorder.Genetic and physiological.\nRelatives of individuals with schizophreniform disorder\nhave an increased risk for schizophrenia.Environmental.\nSeason of birth has been linked to the incidence of schizophrenia, in-\ncluding late winter/early spring in some locations and summer for the deficit form of the\ndisease. The incidence of schizophrenia and related disorders is higher for children grow-\ning up in an urban environment and for some minority ethnic groups.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThere is a strong contribution for genetic factors in deter-\nmining risk for schizophrenia, although most individuals who have been diagnosed with\nschizophrenia have no family history of psychosis. Liability is conferred by a spectrum of\nrisk alleles, common and rare, with each allele contributing only a small fraction to the to-\ntal population variance. The risk alleles identified to date are also associated with other\nmental disorders, including bipolar disorder, depression, and autism spectrum disorder.\nPregnancy and birth complications with hypoxia and greater paternal age are associated\nwith a higher risk of schizophrenia for the developing fetus. In addition, other prenatal\nand perinatal adversities, including stress, infection, malnutrition, maternal diabetes, and\nother medical conditions, have been linked with schizophrenia. However, the vast major-\nity of offspring with these risk factors do not develop schizophrenia.Genetic and physiological.\nAmong individuals with schizophrenia, there may be an in-\ncreased risk for schizoaffective disorder in first-degree relatives. The risk for schizoaffec-\ntive disorder may be increased among individuals who have a first-degree relative with\nschizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or schizoaffective disorder.Course modifiers.\nIdentification and treatment of the underlying medical condition has\nthe greatest impact on course, although preexisting central nervous system injury may\nconfer a worse course outcome (e.g., head trauma, cerebrovascular disease).Environmental. Bipolar disorder is more common in high-income than in low-income\ncountries (1.4 vs. 0.7%). Separated, divorced, or widowed individuals have higher rates of\nbipolar I disorder than do individuals who are married or have never been married, but\nthe direction of the association is unclear.\nGenetic and physiological. A family history of bipolar disorder is one of the strongest and\nmost consistent risk factors for bipolar disorders. There is an average 10-fold increased risk\namong adult relatives of individuals with bipolar I and bipolar II disorders. Magnitude of\nrisk increases with degree of kinship. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder likely share a ge-\nnetic origin, reflected in familial co-aggregation of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\nCourse modifiers. After an individual has a manic episode with psychotic features, subse-\nquent manic episodes are more likely to include psychotic features. Incomplete inter-\nepisode recovery is more common when the current episode is accompanied by mood-\nincongruent psychotic features.Genetic and physiological.\nThe risk of bipolar II disorder tends to be highest among rel-\natives of individuals with bipolar II disorder, as opposed to individuals with bipolar I dis-\norder or major depressive disorder. There may be genetic factors influencing the age at\nonset for bipolar disorders.\nCourse modifiers.\nA rapid-cycling pattern is associated with a poorer prognosis. Return\nto previous level of social function for individuals with bipolar II disorder is more likely\nfor individuals of younger age and with less severe depression, suggesting adverse effects\nof prolonged illness on recovery. More education, fewer years of illness, and being mar-\nried are independently associated with functional recovery in individuals with bipolar\ndisorder, even after diagnostic type (I vs. II), current depressive symptoms, and presence\nof psychiatric comorbidity are taken into account.Genetic and physiological.\nMajor depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder, and bipolar II\ndisorder are more common among first-degree biological relatives of individuals with cyclo-\nthymic disorder than in the general population. There may also be an increased familial risk of\nsubstance-related disorders. Cyclothymic disorder may be more common in the first-degree\nbiological relatives of individuals with bipolar I disorder than in the general population.Temperamental.\nChildren with chronic irritability typically exhibit complicated psy-\nchiatric histories. In such children, a relatively extensive history of chronic irritability is\n158\nDepressive Disorders\ncommon, typically manifesting before full criteria for the syndrome are met. Such predi-\nagnostic presentations may have qualified for a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder.\nMany children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder have symptoms that also\nmeet criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and for an anxiety dis-\norder, with such diagnoses often being present from a relatively early age. For some chil-\ndren, the criteria for major depressive disorder may also be met.\nGenetic and physiological.\nIn terms of familial aggregation and genetics, it has been\nsuggested that children presenting with chronic, non-episodic irritability can be differen-\ntiated from children with bipolar disorder in their family-based risk. However, these two\ngroups do not differ in familial rates of anxiety disorders, unipolar depressive disorders,\nor substance abuse. Compared with children with pediatric bipolar disorder or other men-\ntal illnesses, those with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder exhibit both commonal-\nities and differences in information-processing deficits. For example, face-emotion\nlabeling deficits, as well as perturbed decision making and cognitive control, are present in\nchildren with bipolar disorder and chronically irritable children, as well as in children\nwith some other psychiatric conditions. There is also evidence for disorder-specific dys-\nfunction, such as during tasks assessing attention deployment in response to emotional\nstimuli, which has demonstrated unique signs of dysfunction in children with chronic ir-\nritability.Temperamental.\nNeuroticism (negative affectivity) is a well-established risk factor for the\nonset of major depressive disorder, and high levels appear to render individuals more likely\nto develop depressive episodes in response to stressful life events.\nEnvironmental.\nAdverse childhood experiences, particularly when there are multiple\nexperiences of diverse types, constitute a set of potent risk factors for major depressive dis-\norder. Stressful life events are well recognized as precipitants of major depressive epi-\nsodes, but the presence or absence of adverse life events near the onset of episodes does\nnot appear to provide a useful guide to prognosis or treatment selection.\nGenetic and physiological.\nFirst-degree family members of individuals with major de-\npressive disorder have a risk for major depressive disorder two- to fourfold higher than\nthat of the general population. Relative risks appear to be higher for early-onset and re-\ncurrent forms. Heritability is approximately 40%, and the personality trait neuroticism ac-\ncounts for a substantial portion of this genetic liability.\nCourse modifiers.\nEssentially all major nonmood disorders increase the risk of an indi-\nvidual developing depression. Major depressive episodes that develop against the back-\nground of another disorder often follow a more refractory course. Substance use, anxiety,\nand borderline personality disorders are among the most common of these, and the pre-\nsenting depressive symptoms may obscure and delay their recognition. However, sus-\ntained clinical improvement in depressive symptoms may depend on the appropriate\ntreatment of underlying illnesses. Chronic or disabling medical conditions also increase\nrisks for major depressive episodes. Such prevalent illnesses as diabetes, morbid obesity,\nand cardiovascular disease are often complicated by depressive episodes, and these epi-\nsodes are more likely to become chronic than are depressive episodes in medically healthy\nindividuals.Temperamental.\nFactors predictive of poorer long-term outcome include higher levels\nof neuroticism (negative affectivity), greater symptom severity, poorer global functioning,\nand presence of anxiety disorders or conduct disorder.\nEnvironmental.\nChildhood risk factors include parental loss or separation.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThere are no clear differences in illness development, course,\nor family history between DSM-IV dysthymic disorder and chronic major depressive dis-\norder. Earlier findings pertaining to either disorder are therefore likely to apply to per-\nsistent depressive disorder. It is thus likely that individuals with persistent depressive\ndisorder will have a higher proportion of first-degree relatives with persistent depressive\ndisorder than do individuals with major depressive disorder, and more depressive disor-\nders in general.\nA number of brain regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, amygdala, hip-\npocampus) have been implicated in persistent depressive disorder. Possible polysomno-\ngraphic abnormalities exist as well.Environmental.\nEnvironmental factors associated with the expression of premenstrual\ndysphoric disorder include stress, history of interpersonal trauma, seasonal changes, and\nsociocultural aspects of female sexual behavior in general, and female gender role in par-\nticular.\nGenetic and physiological.\nHeritability of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is unknown.\nHowever, for premenstrual symptoms, estimates for heritability range between 30% and\n80%, with the most stable component of premenstrual symptoms estimated to be about\n50% heritable.\nCourse modifiers.\nWomen who use oral contraceptives may have fewer premenstrual\ncomplaints than do women who do not use oral contraceptives.Temperamental.\nFactors that appear to increase the risk of substance/medication-\ninduced depressive disorder can be conceptualized as pertaining to the specific type of\ndrug or to a group of individuals with underlying alcohol or drug use disorders. Risk fac-\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder\n179\ntors common to all drugs include history of major depressive disorder, history of drug-\ninduced depression, and psychosocial stressors.\nEnvironmental.\nThere are also risks factors pertaining to a specific type of medication\n(e.g., increased immune activation prior to treatment for hepatitis C associated with inter-\nferon-alfa-induced depression); high doses (greater than 80 mg/day prednisone-equiva-\nlents) of corticosteroids or high plasma concentrations of efavirenz; and high estrogen/\nprogesterone content in oral contraceptives.\nCourse modifiers.\nIn a representative U.S. adult population, compared with individuals\nwith major depressive disorder who did not have a substance use disorder, individuals\nwith substance-induced depressive disorder were more likely to be male, to be black, to\nhave at most a high school diploma, to lack insurance, and to have lower family income.\nThey were also more likely to report higher family history of substance use disorders and\nantisocial behavior, higher 12-month history of stressful life events, and a greater number\nof DSM-IV major depressive disorder criteria. They were more likely to report feelings of\nworthlessness, insomnia/hypersomnia, and thoughts of death and suicide attempts, but\nless likely to report depressed mood and parental loss by death before age 18 years.The risk of acute onset of a major depressive disorder following a CVA (within 1 day to a\nweek of the event) appears to be strongly correlated with lesion location, with greatest risk\nassociated with left frontal strokes and least risk apparently associated with right frontal\nlesions in those individuals who present within days of the stroke. The association with\nfrontal regions and laterality is not observed in depressive states that occur in the 2–6 months\nfollowing stroke.Environmental.\nSeparation anxiety disorder often develops after life stress, especially a\nloss (e.g., the death of a relative or pet; an illness of the individual or a relative; a change of\nschools; parental divorce; a move to a new neighborhood; immigration; a disaster that in-\nvolved periods of separation from attachment figures). In young adults, other examples of\nlife stress include leaving the parental home, entering into a romantic relationship, and be-\ncoming a parent. Parental overprotection and intrusiveness may be associated with sepa-\nration anxiety disorder.\nGenetic and physiological.\nSeparation anxiety disorder in children may be heritable.\nHeritability was estimated at 73% in a community sample of 6-year-old twins, with higher\nrates in girls. Children with separation anxiety disorder display particularly enhanced\nsensitivity to respiratory stimulation using CO2-enriched air.Temperamental.\nTemperamental risk factors for selective mutism are not well identi-\nfied. Negative affectivity (neuroticism) or behavioral inhibition may play a role, as may\nparental history of shyness, social isolation, and social anxiety. Children with selective\nmutism may have subtle receptive language difficulties compared with their peers, al-\nthough receptive language is still within the normal range.\nEnvironmental.\nSocial inhibition on the part of parents may serve as a model for social\nreticence and selective mutism in children. Furthermore, parents of children with selective\nmutism have been described as overprotective or more controlling than parents of chil-\ndren with other anxiety disorders or no disorder.\nGenetic and physiological factors.\nBecause of the significant overlap between selective\nmutism and social anxiety disorder, there may be shared genetic factors between these\nconditions.Temperamental.\nTemperamental risk factors for specific phobia, such as negative affec-\ntivity (neuroticism) or behavioral inhibition, are risk factors for other anxiety disorders as\nwell.\nEnvironmental.\nEnvironmental risk factors for specific phobias, such as parental over-\nprotectiveness, parental loss and separation, and physical and sexual abuse, tend to pre-\ndict other anxiety disorders as well. As noted earlier, negative or traumatic encounters\nwith the feared object or situation sometimes (but not always) precede the development of\nspecific phobia.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThere may be a genetic susceptibility to a certain category of\nspecific phobia (e.g., an individual with a first-degree relative with a specific phobia of an-\nimals is significantly more likely to have the same specific phobia than any other category\nof phobia). Individuals with blood-injection-injury phobia show a unique propensity to\nvasovagal syncope (fainting) in the presence of the phobic stimulus.\nSpecific Phobia\n201Temperamental.\nUnderlying traits that predispose individuals to social anxiety disor-\nder include behavioral inhibition and fear of negative evaluation.\nEnvironmental.\nThere is no causative role of increased rates of childhood maltreatment or\nother early-onset psychosocial adversity in the development of social anxiety disorder. How-\never, childhood maltreatment and adversity are risk factors for social anxiety disorder.\nGenetic and physiological.\nTraits predisposing individuals to social anxiety disorder,\nsuch as behavioral inhibition, are strongly genetically influenced. The genetic influence is\nsubject to gene-environment interaction; that is, children with high behavioral inhibition\nare more susceptible to environmental influences, such as socially anxious modeling by\nparents. Also, social anxiety disorder is heritable (but performance-only anxiety less so).\nFirst-degree relatives have a two to six times greater chance of having social anxiety dis-\norder, and liability to the disorder involves the interplay of disorder-specific (e.g., fear of\nnegative evaluation) and nonspecific (e.g., neuroticism) genetic factors.Temperamental.\nNegative affectivity (neuroticism) (i.e., proneness to experiencing neg-\native emotions) and anxiety sensitivity (i.e., the disposition to believe that symptoms of\nanxiety are harmful) are risk factors for the onset of panic attacks and, separately, for\nworry about panic, although their risk status for the diagnosis of panic disorder is un-\nknown. History of “fearful spells” (i.e., limited-symptom attacks that do not meet full cri-\nteria for a panic attack) may be a risk factor for later panic attacks and panic disorder.\nAlthough separation anxiety in childhood, especially when severe, may precede the later\ndevelopment of panic disorder, it is not a consistent risk factor.\nEnvironmental.\nReports of childhood experiences of sexual and physical abuse are more\ncommon in panic disorder than in certain other anxiety disorders. Smoking is a risk factor\nfor panic attacks and panic disorder. Most individuals report identifiable stressors in the\nmonths before their first panic attack (e.g., interpersonal stressors and stressors related to\nphysical well-being, such as negative experiences with illicit or prescription drugs, dis-\nease, or death in the family).\nGenetic and physiological.\nIt is believed that multiple genes confer vulnerability to panic\ndisorder. However, the exact genes, gene products, or functions related to the genetic re-\ngions implicated remain unknown. Current neural systems models for panic disorder em-\nphasize the amygdala and related structures, much as in other anxiety disorders. There is\nan increased risk for panic disorder among offspring of parents with anxiety, depressive,\nand bipolar disorders. Respiratory disturbance, such as asthma, is associated with panic\ndisorder, in terms of past history, comorbidity, and family history.Temperamental.\nNegative affectivity (neuroticism) (i.e., proneness to experiencing neg-\native emotions) and anxiety sensitivity (i.e., the disposition to believe that symptoms of\nanxiety are harmful) are risk factors for the onset of panic attacks. History of “fearful\nspells” (i.e., limited-symptom attacks that do not meet full criteria for a panic attack) may\nbe a risk factor for later panic attacks.\nEnvironmental.\nSmoking is a risk factor for panic attacks. Most individuals report iden-\ntifiable stressors in the months before their first panic attack (e.g., interpersonal stressors\nand stressors related to physical well-being, such as negative experiences with illicit or\nprescription drugs, disease, or death in the family).Temperamental.\nBehavioral inhibition and neurotic disposition (i.e., negative affectivity\n[neuroticism] and anxiety sensitivity) are closely associated with agoraphobia but are rel-\nevant to most anxiety disorders (phobic disorders, panic disorder, generalized anxiety dis-\norder). Anxiety sensitivity (the disposition to believe that symptoms of anxiety are\nharmful) is also characteristic of individuals with agoraphobia.\nEnvironmental.\nNegative events in childhood (e.g., separation, death of parent) and other\nstressful events, such as being attacked or mugged, are associated with the onset of agorapho-\nbia. Furthermore, individuals with agoraphobia describe the family climate and child-rearing\nbehavior as being characterized by reduced warmth and increased overprotection.\nGenetic and physiological.\nHeritability for agoraphobia is 61%. Of the various phobias,\nagoraphobia has the strongest and most specific association with the genetic factor that\nrepresents proneness to phobias.Temperamental.\nBehavioral inhibition, negative affectivity (neuroticism), and harm\navoidance have been associated with generalized anxiety disorder.\nEnvironmental.\nAlthough childhood adversities and parental overprotection have been\nassociated with generalized anxiety disorder, no environmental factors have been identi-\nfied as specific to generalized anxiety disorder or necessary or sufficient for making the di-\nagnosis.\nGenetic and physiological.\nOne-third of the risk of experiencing generalized anxiety\ndisorder is genetic, and these genetic factors overlap with the risk of neuroticism and are\nshared with other anxiety and mood disorders, particularly major depressive disorder.Temperamental.\nGreater internalizing symptoms, higher negative emotionality, and\nbehavioral inhibition in childhood are possible temperamental risk factors.\nEnvironmental.\nPhysical and sexual abuse in childhood and other stressful or traumatic\nevents have been associated with an increased risk for developing OCD. Some children\n240\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\nmay develop the sudden onset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, which has been asso-\nciated with different environmental factors, including various infectious agents and a\npost-infectious autoimmune syndrome.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThe rate of OCD among first-degree relatives of adults with\nOCD is approximately two times that among first-degree relatives of those without the\ndisorder; however, among first-degree relatives of individuals with onset of OCD in child-\nhood or adolescence, the rate is increased 10-fold. Familial transmission is due in part to\ngenetic factors (e.g., a concordance rate of 0.57 for monozygotic vs. 0.22 for dizygotic twins).\nDysfunction in the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and striatum have been\nmost strongly implicated.Environmental.\nBody dysmorphic disorder has been associated with high rates of child-\nhood neglect and abuse.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThe prevalence of body dysmorphic disorder is elevated in\nfirst-degree relatives of individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).Temperamental.\nIndecisiveness is a prominent feature of individuals with hoarding dis-\norder and their first-degree relatives.\nEnvironmental.\nIndividuals with hoarding disorder often retrospectively report stressful\nand traumatic life events preceding the onset of the disorder or causing an exacerbation.\nGenetic and physiological.\nHoarding behavior is familial, with about 50% of individu-\nals who hoard reporting having a relative who also hoards. Twin studies indicate that ap-\nproximately 50% of the variability in hoarding behavior is attributable to additive genetic\nfactors.\n250\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related DisordersGenetic and physiological.\nThere is evidence for a genetic vulnerability to trichotillo-\nmania. The disorder is more common in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder\n(OCD) and their first-degree relatives than in the general population.Genetic and physiological.\nExcoriation disorder is more common in individuals with\nobsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and their first-degree family members than in the\ngeneral population.Environmental.\nSerious social neglect is a diagnostic requirement for reactive attach-\nment disorder and is also the only known risk factor for the disorder. However, the ma-\njority of severely neglected children do not develop the disorder. Prognosis appears to\ndepend on the quality of the caregiving environment following serious neglect.Environmental.\nSerious social neglect is a diagnostic requirement for disinhibited social\nengagement disorder and is also the only known risk factor for the disorder. However, the\nmajority of severely neglected children do not develop the disorder. Neurobiological vul-\nnerability may differentiate neglected children who do and do not develop the disorder.\nHowever, no clear link with any specific neurobiological factors has been established. The\ndisorder has not been identified in children who experience social neglect only after age\n2 years. Prognosis is only modestly associated with quality of the caregiving environment\nfollowing serious neglect. In many cases, the disorder persists, even in children whose\ncaregiving environment becomes markedly improved.\nCourse modifiers.\nCaregiving quality seems to moderate the course of disinhibited so-\ncial engagement disorder. Nevertheless, even after placement in normative caregiving\nenvironments, some children show persistent signs of the disorder, at least through ado-\nlescence.Risk (and protective) factors are generally divided into pretraumatic, peritraumatic, and\nposttraumatic factors.\nPretraumatic factors\nTemperamental.\nThese include childhood emotional problems by age 6 years (e.g., prior\ntraumatic exposure, externalizing or anxiety problems) and prior mental disorders (e.g.,\npanic disorder, depressive disorder, PTSD, or obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD]).\nEnvironmental.\nThese include lower socioeconomic status; lower education; exposure to\nprior trauma (especially during childhood); childhood adversity (e.g., economic depriva-\ntion, family dysfunction, parental separation or death); cultural characteristics (e.g., fatal-\nistic or self-blaming coping strategies); lower intelligence; minority racial/ethnic status;\nand a family psychiatric history. Social support prior to event exposure is protective.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThese include female gender and younger age at the time of\ntrauma exposure (for adults). Certain genotypes may either be protective or increase risk\nof PTSD after exposure to traumatic events.\n278\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\nPeritraumatic factors\nEnvironmental.\nThese include severity (dose) of the trauma (the greater the magnitude\nof trauma, the greater the likelihood of PTSD), perceived life threat, personal injury, in-\nterpersonal violence (particularly trauma perpetrated by a caregiver or involving a wit-\nnessed threat to a caregiver in children), and, for military personnel, being a perpetrator,\nwitnessing atrocities, or killing the enemy. Finally, dissociation that occurs during the trauma\nand persists afterward is a risk factor.\nPosttraumatic factors\nTemperamental.\nThese include negative appraisals, inappropriate coping strategies,\nand development of acute stress disorder.\nEnvironmental.\nThese include subsequent exposure to repeated upsetting reminders, subse-\nquent adverse life events, and financial or other trauma-related losses. Social support (includ-\ning family stability, for children) is a protective factor that moderates outcome after trauma.Temperamental.\nRisk factors include prior mental disorder, high levels of negative af-\nfectivity (neuroticism), greater perceived severity of the traumatic event, and an avoidant\ncoping style. Catastrophic appraisals of the traumatic experience, often characterized by\nexaggerated appraisals of future harm, guilt, or hopelessness, are strongly predictive of\nacute stress disorder.\nEnvironmental.\nFirst and foremost, an individual must be exposed to a traumatic event to\nbe at risk for acute stress disorder. Risk factors for the disorder include a history of prior\ntrauma.\nAcute Stress Disorder\n285\nGenetic and physiological.\nFemales are at greater risk for developing acute stress dis-\norder.\nElevated reactivity, as reflected by acoustic startle response, prior to trauma exposure\nincreases the risk for developing acute stress disorder.Environmental.\nIndividuals from disadvantaged life circumstances experience a high\nrate of stressors and may be at increased risk for adjustment disorders.Environmental.\nInterpersonal physical and sexual abuse is associated with an increased\nrisk of dissociative identity disorder. Prevalence of childhood abuse and neglect in the\nDissociative Identity Disorder\n295\nUnited States, Canada, and Europe among those with the disorder is about 90%. Other\nforms of traumatizing experiences, including childhood medical and surgical procedures,\nwar, childhood prostitution, and terrorism, have been reported.\nCourse modifiers.\nOngoing abuse, later-life retraumatization, comorbidity with mental\ndisorders, severe medical illness, and delay in appropriate treatment are associated with\npoorer prognosis.Environmental.\nSingle or repeated traumatic experiences (e.g., war, childhood maltreat-\nment, natural disaster, internment in concentration camps, genocide) are common ante-\n300\nDissociative Disorders\ncedents. Dissociative amnesia is more likely to occur with 1) a greater number of adverse\nchildhood experiences, particularly physical and/or sexual abuse, 2) interpersonal vio-\nlence; and 3) increased severity, frequency, and violence of the trauma.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThere are no genetic studies of dissociative amnesia. Stud-\nies of dissociation report significant genetic and environmental factors in both clinical and\nnonclinical samples.\nCourse modifiers.\nRemoval from the traumatic circumstances underlying the dissociative\namnesia (e.g., combat) may bring about a rapid return of memory. The memory loss of indi-\nviduals with dissociative fugue may be particularly refractory. Onset of PTSD symptoms may\ndecrease localized, selective, or systematized amnesia. The returning memory, however, may\nbe experienced as flashbacks that alternate with amnesia for the content of the flashbacks.Temperamental.\nIndividuals with depersonalization/derealization disorder are charac-\nterized by harm-avoidant temperament, immature defenses, and both disconnection and\noverconnection schemata. Immature defenses such as idealization/devaluation, projec-\ntion and acting out result in denial of reality and poor adaptation. Cognitive disconnection\nschemata reflect defectiveness and emotional inhibition and subsume themes of abuse, ne-\nglect, and deprivation. Overconnection schemata involve impaired autonomy with themes\nof dependency, vulnerability, and incompetence.\nEnvironmental.\nThere is a clear association between the disorder and childhood interper-\nsonal traumas in a substantial portion of individuals, although this association is not as prev-\nalent or as extreme in the nature of the traumas as in other dissociative disorders, such as\ndissociative identity disorder. In particular, emotional abuse and emotional neglect have been\nmost strongly and consistently associated with the disorder. Other stressors can include phys-\nical abuse; witnessing domestic violence; growing up with a seriously impaired, mentally ill\nparent; or unexpected death or suicide of a family member or close friend. Sexual abuse is a\nmuch less common antecedent but can be encountered. The most common proximal precipi-\ntants of the disorder are severe stress (interpersonal, financial, occupational), depression, anx-\niety (particularly panic attacks), and illicit drug use. Symptoms may be specifically induced by\nsubstances such as tetrahydrocannabinol, hallucinogens, ketamine, MDMA (3,4-methylene-\ndioxymethamphetamine; “ecstasy”) and salvia. Marijuana use may precipitate new-onset\npanic attacks and depersonalization/derealization symptoms simultaneously.Temperamental.\nThe personality trait of negative affectivity (neuroticism) has been identi-\nfied as an independent correlate/risk factor of a high number of somatic symptoms. Comorbid\nanxiety or depression is common and may exacerbate symptoms and impairment.\nEnvironmental.\nSomatic symptom disorder is more frequent in individuals with few years\nof education and low socioeconomic status, and in those who have recently experienced\nstressful life events.\nCourse modifiers.\nPersistent somatic symptoms are associated with demographic fea-\ntures (female sex, older age, fewer years of education, lower socioeconomic status, un-\nemployment), a reported history of sexual abuse or other childhood adversity, concurrent\nchronic physical illness or psychiatric disorder (depression, anxiety, persistent depressive\ndisorder [dysthymia], panic), social stress, and reinforcing social factors such as illness\nbenefits. Cognitive factors that affect clinical course include sensitization to pain, height-\nened attention to bodily sensations, and attribution of bodily symptoms to a possible med-\nical illness rather than recognizing them as a normal phenomenon or psychological stress.Environmental.\nIllness anxiety disorder may sometimes be precipitated by a major life\nstress or a serious but ultimately benign threat to the individual’s health. A history of child-\nIllness Anxiety Disorder\n317\nhood abuse or of a serious childhood illness may predispose to development of the disor-\nder in adulthood.\nCourse modifiers.\nApproximately one-third to one-half of individuals with illness anx-\niety disorder have a transient form, which is associated with less psychiatric comorbidity,\nmore medical comorbidity, and less severe illness anxiety disorder.Temperamental.\nMaladaptive personality traits are commonly associated with conver-\nsion disorder.\nEnvironmental.\nThere may be a history of childhood abuse and neglect. Stressful life\nevents are often, but not always, present.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThe presence of neurological disease that causes similar symp-\ntoms is a risk factor (e.g., non-epileptic seizures are more common in patients who also\nhave epilepsy).\nCourse modifiers.\nShort duration of symptoms and acceptance of the diagnosis are pos-\nitive prognostic factors. Maladaptive personality traits, the presence of comorbid physical\ndisease, and the receipt of disability benefits may be negative prognostic factors.Environmental.\nNeglect, lack of supervision, and developmental delay can increase the\nrisk for this condition.\nPica\n331Environmental.\nPsychosocial problems such as lack of stimulation, neglect, stressful life\nsituations, and problems in the parent-child relationship may be predisposing factors in\ninfants and young children.Temperamental.\nAnxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorder, obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may increase risk for avoidant or\nrestrictive feeding or eating behavior characteristic of the disorder.\nEnvironmental.\nEnvironmental risk factors for avoidant/restrictive food intake disor-\nder include familial anxiety. Higher rates of feeding disturbances may occur in children of\nmothers with eating disorders.\nGenetic and physiological.\nHistory of gastrointestinal conditions, gastroesophageal re-\nflux disease, vomiting, and a range of other medical problems has been associated with\nfeeding and eating behaviors characteristic of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.Temperamental.\nIndividuals who develop anxiety disorders or display obsessional\ntraits in childhood are at increased risk of developing anorexia nervosa.\nEnvironmental.\nHistorical and cross-cultural variability in the prevalence of anorexia\nnervosa supports its association with cultures and settings in which thinness is valued. Oc-\ncupations and avocations that encourage thinness, such as modeling and elite athletics, are\nalso associated with increased risk.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThere is an increased risk of anorexia nervosa and bulimia\nnervosa among first-degree biological relatives of individuals with the disorder. An in-\ncreased risk of bipolar and depressive disorders has also been found among first-degree\nrelatives of individuals with anorexia nervosa, particularly relatives of individuals with\nthe binge-eating/purging type. Concordance rates for anorexia nervosa in monozygotic\ntwins are significantly higher than those for dizygotic twins. A range of brain abnormali-\nties has been described in anorexia nervosa using functional imaging technologies (func-\ntional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography). The degree to which\nthese findings reflect changes associated with malnutrition versus primary abnormalities\nassociated with the disorder is unclear.Temperamental.\nWeight concerns, low self-esteem, depressive symptoms, social anxi-\nety disorder, and overanxious disorder of childhood are associated with increased risk for\nthe development of bulimia nervosa.\nEnvironmental.\nInternalization of a thin body ideal has been found to increase risk for\ndeveloping weight concerns, which in turn increase risk for the development of bulimia\nnervosa. Individuals who experienced childhood sexual or physical abuse are at increased\nrisk for developing bulimia nervosa.\nGenetic and physiological.\nChildhood obesity and early pubertal maturation increase\nrisk for bulimia nervosa. Familial transmission of bulimia nervosa may be present, as well\nas genetic vulnerabilities for the disorder.\nCourse modifiers.\nSeverity of psychiatric comorbidity predicts worse long-term outcome\nof bulimia nervosa.Genetic and physiological.\nBinge-eating disorder appears to run in families, which may\nreflect additive genetic influences.Environmental.\nA number of predisposing factors for enuresis have been suggested, in-\ncluding delayed or lax toilet training and psychosocial stress.\nGenetic and physiological.\nEnuresis has been associated with delays in the develop-\nment of normal circadian rhythms of urine production, with resulting nocturnal polyuria\nor abnormalities of central vasopressin receptor sensitivity, and reduced functional blad-\nder capacities with bladder hyperreactivity (unstable bladder syndrome). Nocturnal en-\nuresis is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. Heritability has been shown in family, twin,\nand segregation analyses. Risk for childhood nocturnal enuresis is approximately 3.6 times\nhigher in offspring of enuretic mothers and 10.1 times higher in the presence of paternal\nurinary incontinence. The risk magnitudes for nocturnal enuresis and diurnal incontinence\nare similar.\nEncopresis\n357Genetic and physiological.\nPainful defecation can lead to constipation and a cycle of with-\nholding behaviors that make encopresis more likely. Use of some medications (e.g., anti-\nconvulsants, cough suppressants) may increase constipation and make encopresis more\nlikely.While the risk and prognostic factors discussed in this section increase vulnerability to in-\nsomnia, sleep disturbances are more likely to occur when predisposed individuals are ex-\nposed to precipitating events, such as major life events (e.g., illness, separation) or less\nsevere but more chronic daily stress. Most individuals resume normal sleep patterns after\nthe initial triggering event has disappeared, but others—perhaps those more vulnerable to\ninsomnia—continue experiencing persistent sleep difficulties. Perpetuating factors such as\npoor sleep habits, irregular sleep scheduling, and the fear of not sleeping feed into the in-\nsomnia problem and may contribute to a vicious cycle that may induce persistent insomnia.\nTemperamental.\nAnxiety or worry-prone personality or cognitive styles, increased arousal\npredisposition, and tendency to repress emotions can increase vulnerability to insomnia.\nEnvironmental.\nNoise, light, uncomfortably high or low temperature, and high altitude\nmay also increase vulnerability to insomnia.\nGenetic and physiological.\nFemale gender and advancing age are associated with in-\ncreased vulnerability to insomnia. Disrupted sleep and insomnia display a familial dispo-\nsition. The prevalence of insomnia is higher among monozygotic twins relative to\ndizygotic twins; it is also higher in first-degree family members compared with the general\npopulation. The extent to which this link is inherited through a genetic predisposition,\nlearned by observations of parental models, or established as a by-product of another psy-\nchopathology remains undetermined.\nCourse modifiers.\nDeleterious course modifiers include poor sleep hygiene practices\n(e.g., excessive caffeine use, irregular sleep schedules).Environmental.\nHypersomnolence can be increased temporarily by psychological stress\nand alcohol use, but they have not been documented as environmental precipitating\nfactors. Viral infections have been reported to have preceded or accompanied hyper-\nsomnolence in about 10% of cases. Viral infections, such as HIV pneumonia, infectious\nmononucleosis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome, can also evolve into hypersomnolence within\nHypersomnolence Disorder\n371\nmonths after the infection. Hypersomnolence can also appear within 6–18 months follow-\ning a head trauma.\nGenetic and physiological.\nHypersomnolence may be familial, with an autosomal-\ndominant mode of inheritance.Temperamental.\nParasomnias, such as sleepwalking, bruxism, REM sleep behavior dis-\norder, and enuresis, may be more common in individuals who develop narcolepsy. Indi-\nviduals commonly report that they need more sleep than other family members.\nEnvironmental.\nGroup A streptococcal throat infection, influenza (notably pandemic\nH1N1 2009), or other winter infections are likely triggers of the autoimmune process, pro-\n376\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nducing narcolepsy a few months later. Head trauma and abrupt changes in sleep-wake\npatterns (e.g., job changes, stress) may be additional triggers.\nGenetic and physiological.\nMonozygotic twins are 25%–32% concordant for narcolepsy.\nThe prevalence of narcolepsy is 1%–2% in first-degree relatives (a 10- to 40-fold increase\noverall). Narcolepsy is strongly associated with DQB1*06:02 (99% vs. 12%–38% in control\nsubjects of various ethnic groups; 25% in the general U.S. population). DQB1*03:01 in-\ncreases, while DQB1*05:01, DQB1*06:01, and DQB1*06:03 reduce risk in the presence of\nDQB1*06:02, but the effect is small. Polymorphisms within the T-cell receptor alpha gene\nand other immune modulating genes also modulate risk slightly.Genetic and physiological.\nThe major risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea\nare obesity and male gender. Others include maxillary-mandibular retrognathia or micro-\ngnathia, positive family history of sleep apnea, genetic syndromes that reduce upper\nairway patency (e.g., Down’s syndrome, Treacher Collin’s syndrome), adenotonsillar hy-\npertrophy (especially in young children), menopause (in females), and various endocrine\nsyndromes (e.g., acromegaly). Compared with premenopausal females, males are at in-\ncreased risk for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, possibly reflecting the influences of sex\nhormones on ventilatory control and body fat distribution, as well as because of gender\ndifferences in airway structure. Medications for mental disorders and medical conditions\nthat tend to induce somnolence may worsen the course of apnea symptoms if these med-\nications are not managed carefully.\nObstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea\n381\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea has a strong genetic basis, as evidenced by the sig-\nnificant familial aggregation of the apnea hypopnea index. The prevalence of obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea is approximately twice as high among the first-degree relatives of\nprobands with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea as compared with members of control\nfamilies. One-third of the variance in the apnea hypopnea index is explained by shared fa-\nmilial factors. Although genetic markers with diagnostic or prognostic value are not yet\navailable for use, eliciting a family history of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea should in-\ncrease the clinical suspicion for the disorder.Genetic and physiological.\nCheyne-Stokes breathing is frequently present in individu-\nals with heart failure. The coexistence of atrial fibrillation further increases risk, as do older\nage and male gender. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is also seen in association with acute stroke\nand possibly renal failure. The underlying ventilatory instability in the setting of heart fail-\nure has been attributed to increased ventilatory chemosensitivity and hyperventilation\ndue to pulmonary vascular congestion and circulatory delay. Central sleep apnea is seen\nin individuals taking long-acting opioids.Environmental.\nVentilatory drive can be reduced in individuals using central nervous\nsystem depressants, including benzodiazepines, opiates, and alcohol.\nGenetic and physiological.\nIdiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation is associated with\nreduced ventilatory drive due to a blunted chemoresponsiveness to CO2 (reduced respi-\nratory drive; i.e., “won’t breathe”), reflecting underlying neurological deficits in centers\ngoverning the control of ventilation. More commonly, sleep-related hypoventilation is co-\nmorbid with another medical condition, such as a pulmonary disorder, a neuromuscular\nor chest wall disorder, or hypothyroidism, or with use of medications (e.g., benzodiaze-\npines, opiates). In these conditions, the hypoventilation may be a consequence of in-\ncreased work of breathing and/or impairment of respiratory muscle function (i.e., “can’t\nbreathe”) or reduced respiratory drive (i.e., “won’t breathe”).\nNeuromuscular disorders influence breathing through impairment of respiratory mo-\ntor innervation or respiratory muscle function. They include conditions such as amyo-\ntrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord injury, diaphragmatic paralysis, myasthenia gravis,\nLambert-Eaton syndrome, toxic or metabolic myopathies, postpolio syndrome, and Char-\ncot-Marie-Tooth syndrome.\nCongenital central alveolar hypoventilation is a genetic disorder attributable to muta-\ntions of PHOX2B, a gene that is crucial for the development of the embryonic autonomic\nnervous system and neural crest derivatives. Children with congenital central alveolar hy-\npoventilation show blunted ventilatory responses to hypercapnia, especially in non–rapid\neye movement sleep.\nSleep-Related Hypoventilation\n389Genetic and physiological.\nPredisposing factors may include a longer than average cir-\ncadian period, changes in light sensitivity, and impaired homeostatic sleep drive. Some in-\ndividuals with delayed sleep phase type may be hypersensitive to evening light, which\ncan serve as a delay signal to the circadian clock, or they may be hyposensitive to morning\nlight such that its phase-advancing effects are reduced. Genetic factors may play a role in\nthe pathogenesis of familial and sporadic forms of delayed sleep phase type, including\nmutations in circadian genes (e.g., PER3, CKIe).Environmental.\nDecreased late afternoon/early evening exposure to light and/or expo-\nsure to early morning light due to early morning awakening can increase the risk of ad-\nvanced sleep phase type by advancing circadian rhythms. By going to bed early, these\nindividuals are not exposed to light in the phase delay region of the curve, resulting in per-\npetuation of advanced phase. In familial advanced sleep phase type, a shortening of the\nendogenous circadian period can result in an advanced sleep phase, although circadian pe-\nriod does not appear to systematically decrease with age.\nGenetic and physiological.\nAdvanced sleep phase type has demonstrated an autoso-\nmal dominant mode of inheritance, including a PER2 gene mutation causing hypophos-\nphorylation of the PER2 protein and a missense mutation in CKI.Temperamental.\nNeurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s\ndisease, and Huntington’s disease, and neurodevelopmental disorders in children in-\ncrease the risk for irregular sleep-wake type.\nEnvironmental.\nDecreased exposure to environmental light and structured daytime ac-\ntivity can be associated with a low-amplitude circadian rhythm. Hospitalized individuals\nare especially prone to such weak external entraining stimuli, and even outside the hospi-\ntal setting, individuals with major neurocognitive disorder (i.e., dementia) are exposed to\nsignificantly less bright light.Environmental.\nIn sighted individuals, decreased exposure or sensitivity to light and so-\ncial and physical activity cues may contribute to a free-running circadian rhythm. With the\nCircadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders\n397\nhigh frequency of mental disorders involving social isolation and cases of non-24-hour\nsleep-wake type developing after a change in sleep habits (e.g., night shift work, job loss),\nbehavioral factors in combination with physiological tendency may precipitate and per-\npetuate this disorder in sighted individuals. Hospitalized individuals with neurological and\npsychiatric disorders can become insensitive to social cues, predisposing them to the de-\nvelopment of non-24-hour sleep-wake type.\nGenetic and physiological.\nBlindness is a risk factor for non-24-hour sleep-wake type.\nNon-24-hour sleep-wake type has been associated with traumatic brain injury.Temperamental.\nPredisposing factors include a morning-type disposition, a need for\nlong (i.e., more than 8 hours) sleep durations in order to feel well rested, and strong com-\npeting social and domestic needs (e.g., parents of young children). Individuals who are able\nto commit to a nocturnal lifestyle, with few competing day-oriented demands, appear at\nlower risk for shift work type.\nGenetic and physiological.\nBecause shift workers are more likely than day workers to\nbe obese, obstructive sleep apnea may be present and may exacerbate the symptoms.Environmental.\nSedative use, sleep deprivation, sleep-wake schedule disruptions, fa-\ntigue, and physical or emotional stress increase the likelihood of episodes. Fever and sleep\ndeprivation can produce an increased frequency of NREM sleep arousal disorders.\nGenetic and physiological.\nA family history for sleepwalking or sleep terrors may oc-\ncur in up to 80% of individuals who sleepwalk. The risk for sleepwalking is further in-\ncreased (to as much as 60% of offspring) when both parents have a history of the disorder.\nIndividuals with sleep terrors frequently have a positive family history of either sleep\nterrors or sleepwalking, with as high as a 10-fold increase in the prevalence of the disorder\namong first-degree biological relatives. Sleep terrors are much more common in monozy-\ngotic twins as compared with dizygotic twins. The exact mode of inheritance is unknown.Temperamental.\nIndividuals who experience nightmares report more frequent past ad-\nverse events, but not necessarily trauma, and often display personality disturbances or\npsychiatric diagnosis.\nEnvironmental.\nSleep deprivation or fragmentation, and irregular sleep-wake schedules\nthat alter the timing, intensity, or quantity of REM sleep, can put individuals at risk for\nnightmares.\nGenetic and physiological.\nTwin studies have identified genetic effects on the disposi-\ntion to nightmares and their co-occurrence with other parasomnias (e.g., sleeptalking).\nCourse modifiers.\nAdaptive parental bedside behaviors, such as soothing the child fol-\nlowing nightmares, may protect against developing chronic nightmares.\n406\nSleep-Wake DisordersGenetic and physiological.\nMany widely prescribed medications, including tricyclic\nantidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reup-\ntake inhibitors, and beta-blockers, may result in polysomnographic evidence of REM sleep\nwithout atonia and in frank REM sleep behavior disorder. It is not known whether the\nmedications per se result in REM sleep behavior disorder or they unmask an underlying\npredisposition.Genetic and physiological.\nPredisposing factors include female gender, advancing\nage, genetic risk variants, and family history of RLS. Precipitating factors are often time-\nlimited, such as iron deficiency, with most individuals resuming normal sleep patterns\nafter the initial triggering event has disappeared. Genetic risk variants also play a role in\nRLS secondary to such disorders as uremia, suggesting that individuals with a genetic sus-\nceptibility develop RLS in the presence of further risk factors. RLS has a strong familial\ncomponent.\nThere are defined pathophysiological pathways subserving RLS. Genome-wide asso-\nciation studies have found that RLS is significantly associated with common genetic vari-\nants in intronic or intergenic regions in MEIS1, BTBD9, and MAP2K5 on chromosomes 2p,\n6p, and 15q, respectively. The association of these three variants with RLS has been inde-\npendently replicated. BTBD9 confers a very large (80%) excessive risk when even a single\nallele is present. Because of the high frequency of this variant in individuals of European\ndescent, the population attributable risk (PAR) approximates 50%. At-risk alleles associ-\nated with MEIS1 and BTBD9 are less common in individuals of African or Asian descent,\nperhaps suggesting lower risk for RLS in these populations.\nPathophysiological mechanisms in RLS also include disturbances in the central dopa-\nminergic system and disturbances in iron metabolism. The endogenous opiate system\nmay also be involved. Treatment effects of dopaminergic drugs (primarily D2 and D3 non-\nergot agonists) provide further support that RLS is grounded in dysfunctional central\ndopaminergic pathways. While the effective treatment of RLS has also been shown to sig-\nnificantly reduce depressive symptoms, serotonergic antidepressants can induce or aggra-\nvate RLS in some individuals.are normative for certain age groups. They are relevant for, and likely applicable to, the\ntype of sleep disturbance encountered (see the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive\nDisorders” for descriptions of respective substance use disorders).\nTemperamental.\nSubstance use generally precipitates or accompanies insomnia in vul-\nnerable individuals. Thus, presence of insomnia in response to stress or change in sleep en-\nvironment or timing can represent a risk for developing substance/medication-induced\nsleep disorder. A similar risk may be present for individuals with other sleep disorders\n(e.g., individuals with hypersomnia who use stimulants).Genetic and physiological.\nAge-related loss of the fast-conducting peripheral sensory\nnerves and age-related decreased sex steroid secretion may be associated with the increase\nin delayed ejaculation in men older than 50 years.Temperamental.\nNeurotic personality traits may be associated with erectile problems in col-\nlege students, and submissive personality traits may be associated with erectile problems in\nmen age 40 years and older. Alexithymia (i.e., deficits in cognitive processing of emotions) is\ncommon in men diagnosed with “psychogenic” erectile dysfunction. Erectile problems are\ncommon in men diagnosed with depression and posttraumatic stress disorder.\nCourse modifiers.\nRisk factors for acquired erectile disorder include age, smoking to-\nbacco, lack of physical exercise, diabetes, and decreased desire.Temperamental.\nA wide range of psychological factors, such as anxiety and concerns\nabout pregnancy, can potentially interfere with a woman’s ability to experience orgasm.\nEnvironmental.\nThere is a strong association between relationship problems, physical\nhealth, and mental health and orgasm difficulties in women. Sociocultural factors (e.g.,\ngender role expectations and religious norms) are also important influences on the expe-\nrience of orgasmic difficulties.\nGenetic and physiological.\nMany physiological factors may influence a woman’s expe-\nrience of orgasm, including medical conditions and medications. Conditions such as mul-\ntiple sclerosis, pelvic nerve damage from radical hysterectomy, and spinal cord injury can\nall influence orgasmic functioning in women. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are\nknown to delay or inhibit orgasm in women. Women with vulvovaginal atrophy (charac-\nterized by symptoms such as vaginal dryness, itching, and pain) are significantly more\nlikely to report orgasm difficulties than are women without this condition. Menopausal\nstatus is not consistently associated with the likelihood of orgasm difficulties. There may\nbe a significant genetic contribution to variation in female orgasmic function. However,\n432\nSexual Dysfunctions\npsychological, sociocultural, and physiological factors likely interact in complex ways to\ninfluence women’s experience of orgasm and of orgasm difficulties.Temperamental.\nTemperamental factors include negative cognitions and attitudes about\nsexuality and past history of mental disorders. Differences in propensity for sexual excitation\nand sexual inhibition may also predict the likelihood of developing sexual problems.\nEnvironmental.\nEnvironmental factors include relationship difficulties, partner sexual\nfunctioning, and developmental history, such as early relationships with caregivers and\nchildhood stressors.\nGenetic and physiological.\nSome medical conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus, thyroid\ndysfunction) can be risk factors for female sexual interest/arousal disorder. There appears\nto be a strong influence of genetic factors on vulnerability to sexual problems in women.\nPsychophysiological research using vaginal photoplethysmography has not found differ-\nences between women with and without perceived lack of genital arousal.Environmental.\nSexual and/or physical abuse have often been cited as predictors of the\nDSM-IV-defined sexual pain disorders dyspareunia and vaginismus. This is a matter of con-\ntroversy in the current literature.\nGenetic and physiological.\nWomen experiencing superficial pain during sexual inter-\ncourse often report the onset of the pain after a history of vaginal infections. Even after the in-\nfections have resolved and there are no known residual physical findings, the pain persists.\nPain during tampon insertion or the inability to insert tampons before any sexual contact has\nbeen attempted is an important risk factor for genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder.Temperamental.\nMood and anxiety symptoms appear to be strong predictors of low de-\nsire in men. Up to half of men with a past history of psychiatric symptoms may have mod-\nerate or severe loss of desire, compared with only 15% of those without such a history. A\nman’s feelings about himself, his perception of his partner’s sexual desire toward him,\nfeelings of being emotionally connected, and contextual variables may all negatively (as\nwell as positively) affect sexual desire.\nEnvironmental.\nAlcohol use may increase the occurrence of low desire. Among gay men,\nself-directed homophobia, interpersonal problems, attitudes, lack of adequate sex educa-\ntion, and trauma resulting from early life experiences must be taken into account in ex-\nplaining the low desire. Social and cultural contextual factors should also be considered.\nGenetic and physiological.\nEndocrine disorders such as hyperprolactinemia signifi-\ncantly affect sexual desire in men. Age is a significant risk factor for low desire in men. It is\nunclear whether or not men with low desire also have abnormally low levels of testoster-\none; however, among hypogonadal men, low desire is common. There also may be a crit-\nical threshold below which testosterone will affect sexual desire in men and above which\nthere is little effect of testosterone on men’s desire.Temperamental.\nPremature (early) ejaculation may be more common in men with anx-\niety disorders, especially social anxiety disorder (social phobia).\nGenetic and physiological.\nThere is a moderate genetic contribution to lifelong prema-\nture (early) ejaculation. Premature (early) ejaculation may be associated with dopamine\ntransporter gene polymorphism or serotonin transporter gene polymorphism. Thyroid\ndisease, prostatitis, and drug withdrawal are associated with acquired premature (early)\nejaculation. Positron emission tomography measures of regional cerebral blood flow dur-\ning ejaculation have shown primary activation in the mesocephalic transition zone, includ-\ning the ventral tegmental area.Temperamental.\nFor individuals with gender dysphoria without a disorder of sex de-\nvelopment, atypical gender behavior among individuals with early-onset gender dyspho-\nria develops in early preschool age, and it is possible that a high degree of atypicality\nmakes the development of gender dysphoria and its persistence into adolescence and\nadulthood more likely.\nEnvironmental.\nAmong individuals with gender dysphoria without a disorder of sex de-\nvelopment, males with gender dysphoria (in both childhood and adolescence) more com-\nmonly have older brothers than do males without the condition. Additional predisposing\nGender Dysphoria\n457\nfactors under consideration, especially in individuals with late-onset gender dysphoria (ad-\nolescence, adulthood), include habitual fetishistic transvestism developing into autogyne-\nphilia (i.e., sexual arousal associated with the thought or image of oneself as a woman) and\nother forms of more general social, psychological, or developmental problems.\nGenetic and physiological.\nFor individuals with gender dysphoria without a disorder of\nsex development, some genetic contribution is suggested by evidence for (weak) familial-\nity of transsexualism among nontwin siblings, increased concordance for transsexualism\nin monozygotic compared with dizygotic same-sex twins, and some degree of heritability\nof gender dysphoria. As to endocrine findings, no endogenous systemic abnormalities in\nsex-hormone levels have been found in 46,XY individuals, whereas there appear to be in-\ncreased androgen levels (in the range found in hirsute women but far below normal male\nlevels) in 46,XX individuals. Overall, current evidence is insufficient to label gender dys-\nphoria without a disorder of sex development as a form of intersexuality limited to the cen-\ntral nervous system.\nIn gender dysphoria associated with a disorder of sex development, the likelihood of\nlater gender dysphoria is increased if prenatal production and utilization (via receptor\nsensitivity) of androgens are grossly atypical relative to what is usually seen in individuals\nwith the same assigned gender. Examples include 46,XY individuals with a history of nor-\nmal male prenatal hormone milieu but inborn nonhormonal genital defects (as in cloacal\nbladder exstrophy or penile agenesis) and who have been assigned to the female gender.\nThe likelihood of gender dysphoria is further enhanced by additional, prolonged, highly\ngender-atypical postnatal androgen exposure with somatic virilization as may occur in fe-\nmale-raised and noncastrated 46,XY individuals with 5-alpha reductase-2 deficiency or\n17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-3 deficiency or in female-raised 46,XX individuals\nwith classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia with prolonged periods of non-adherence to\nglucocorticoid replacement therapy. However, the prenatal androgen milieu is more\nclosely related to gendered behavior than to gender identity. Many individuals with dis-\norders of sex development and markedly gender-atypical behavior do not develop gender\ndysphoria. Thus, gender-atypical behavior by itself should not be interpreted as an indi-\ncator of current or future gender dysphoria. There appears to be a higher rate of gender\ndysphoria and patient-initiated gender change from assigned female to male than from as-\nsigned male to female in 46,XY individuals with a disorder of sex development.Environmental.\nIndividuals with a history of physical and emotional trauma during the\nfirst two decades of life are at increased risk for intermittent explosive disorder.\n468\nDisruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders\nGenetic and physiological.\nFirst-degree relatives of individuals with intermittent ex-\nplosive disorder are at increased risk for intermittent explosive disorder, and twin studies\nhave demonstrated a substantial genetic influence for impulsive aggression.\nResearch provides neurobiological support for the presence of serotonergic abnormal-\nities, globally and in the brain, specifically in areas of the limbic system (anterior cingulate)\nand orbitofrontal cortex in individuals with intermittent explosive disorder. Amygdala\nresponses to anger stimuli, during functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning, are\ngreater in individuals with intermittent explosive disorder compared with healthy indi-\nviduals.Temperamental.\nTemperamental risk factors include a difficult undercontrolled infant\ntemperament and lower-than-average intelligence, particularly with regard to verbal IQ.\nEnvironmental.\nFamily-level risk factors include parental rejection and neglect, inconsis-\ntent child-rearing practices, harsh discipline, physical or sexual abuse, lack of supervision,\nearly institutional living, frequent changes of caregivers, large family size, parental criminal-\nity, and certain kinds of familial psychopathology (e.g., substance-related disorders). Com-\nmunity-level risk factors include peer rejection, association with a delinquent peer group,\nand neighborhood exposure to violence. Both types of risk factors tend to be more common\nand severe among individuals with the childhood-onset subtype of conduct disorder.\n474\nDisruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders\nGenetic and physiological.\nConduct disorder is influenced by both genetic and envi-\nronmental factors. The risk is increased in children with a biological or adoptive parent or\na sibling with conduct disorder. The disorder also appears to be more common in children\nof biological parents with severe alcohol use disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, or\nschizophrenia or biological parents who have a history of ADHD or conduct disorder.\nFamily history particularly characterizes individuals with the childhood-onset subtype of\nconduct disorder. Slower resting heart rate has been reliably noted in individuals with\nconduct disorder compared with those without the disorder, and this marker is not char-\nacteristic of any other mental disorder. Reduced autonomic fear conditioning, particularly\nlow skin conductance, is also well documented. However, these psychophysiological find-\nings are not diagnostic of the disorder. Structural and functional differences in brain areas\nassociated with affect regulation and affect processing, particularly frontotemporal-limbic\nconnections involving the brain’s ventral prefrontal cortex and amygdala, have been con-\nsistently noted in individuals with conduct disorder compared with those without the dis-\norder. However, neuroimaging findings are not diagnostic of the disorder.\nCourse modifiers.\nPersistence is more likely for individuals with behaviors that meet\ncriteria for the childhood-onset subtype and qualify for the specifier “with limited pro-\nsocial emotions”. The risk that conduct disorder will persist is also increased by co-occurring\nADHD and by substance abuse.Genetic and physiological.\nThere are no controlled family history studies of kleptoma-\nnia. However, first-degree relatives of individuals with kleptomania may have higher\nrates of obsessive-compulsive disorder than the general population. There also appears to\nbe a higher rate of substance use disorders, including alcohol use disorder, in relatives of\nindividuals with kleptomania than in the general population.", "cultural_issues": "Specific learning disorder occurs across languages, cultures, races, and socioeconomic\nconditions but may vary in its manifestation according to the nature of the spoken and\nwritten symbol systems and cultural and educational practices. For example, the cognitive\nprocessing requirements of reading and of working with numbers vary greatly across or-\nthographies. In the English language, the observable hallmark clinical symptom of diffi-\nculties learning to read is inaccurate and slow reading of single words; in other alphabetic\nlanguages that have more direct mapping between sounds and letters (e.g., Spanish, Ger-\nman) and in non-alphabetic languages (e.g., Chinese, Japanese), the hallmark feature is\nSpecific Learning Disorder\n73\nslow but accurate reading. In English-language learners, assessment should include con-\nsideration of whether the source of reading difficulties is a limited proficiency with Eng-\nlish or a specific learning disorder. Risk factors for specific learning disorder in English-\nlanguage learners include a family history of specific learning disorder or language delay\nin the native language, as well as learning difficulties in English and failure to catch up\nwith peers. If there is suspicion of cultural or language differences (e.g., as in an English-\nlanguage learner), the assessment needs to take into account the individual’s language\nproficiency in his or her first or native language as well as in the second language (in this\nexample, English). Also, assessment should consider the linguistic and cultural context in\nwhich the individual is living, as well as his or her educational and learning history in the\noriginal culture and language.Developmental coordination disorder occurs across cultures, races, and socioeconomic\nconditions. By definition, “activities of daily living” implies cultural differences necessi-\ntating consideration of the context in which the individual child is living as well as\nwhether he or she has had appropriate opportunities to learn and practice such activities.Stereotypic movement disorder, with or without self-injury, occurs in all races and cultures.\nCultural attitudes toward unusual behaviors may result in delayed diagnosis. Overall cultural\ntolerance and attitudes toward stereotypic movement vary and must be considered.Tic disorders do not appear to vary in clinical characteristics, course, or etiology by race,\nethnicity, and culture. However, race, ethnicity, and culture may impact how tic disorders\nare perceived and managed in the family and community, as well as influencing patterns\nof help seeking, and choices of treatment.\n84\nNeurodevelopmental DisordersAn individual’s cultural and religious background must be taken into account in evaluat-\ning the possible presence of delusional disorder. The content of delusions also varies\nacross cultural contexts.It is important to distinguish symptoms of brief psychotic disorder from culturally sanc-\ntioned response patterns. For example, in some religious ceremonies, an individual may\nreport hearing voices, but these do not generally persist and are not perceived as abnormal\nby most members of the individual’s community. In addition, cultural and religious back-\nground must be taken into account when considering whether beliefs are delusional.Cultural and socioeconomic factors must be considered, particularly when the individual\nand the clinician do not share the same cultural and socioeconomic background. Ideas that\nappear to be delusional in one culture (e.g., witchcraft) may be commonly held in another.\nIn some cultures, visual or auditory hallucinations with a religious content (e.g., hearing\nGod’s voice) are a normal part of religious experience. In addition, the assessment of dis-\norganized speech may be made difficult by linguistic variation in narrative styles across\ncultures. The assessment of affect requires sensitivity to differences in styles of emotional\nexpression, eye contact, and body language, which vary across cultures. If the assessment\nis conducted in a language that is different from the individual’s primary language, care\nmust be taken to ensure that alogia is not related to linguistic barriers. In certain cultures,\ndistress may take the form of hallucinations or pseudo-hallucinations and overvalued\nideas that may present clinically similar to true psychosis but are normative to the pa-\ntient’s subgroup.Cultural and socioeconomic factors must be considered, particularly when the individual\nand the clinician do not share the same cultural and economic background. Ideas that ap-\npear to be delusional in one culture (e.g., witchcraft) may be commonly held in another.\nThere is also some evidence in the literature for the overdiagnosis of schizophrenia com-\nSchizoaffective Disorder\n109\npared with schizoaffective disorder in African American and Hispanic populations, so\ncare must be taken to ensure a culturally appropriate evaluation that includes both psy-\nchotic and affective symptoms.Little information exists on specific cultural differences in the expression of bipolar I dis-\norder. One possible explanation for this may be that diagnostic instruments are often\ntranslated and applied in different cultures with no transcultural validation. In one U.S.\nstudy, 12-month prevalence of bipolar I disorder was significantly lower for Afro-Carib-\nbeans than for African Americans or whites.Culture-related differences, to the extent that there is any evidence, pertain to those asso-\nciated with the medical condition (e.g., rates of multiple sclerosis and stroke vary around\nthe world based on dietary, genetic factors, and other environmental factors).Surveys of major depressive disorder across diverse cultures have shown sevenfold dif-\nferences in 12-month prevalence rates but much more consistency in female-to-male ratio,\nmean ages at onset, and the degree to which presence of the disorder raises the likelihood\nof comorbid substance abuse. While these findings suggest substantial cultural differences\nin the expression of major depressive disorder, they do not permit simple linkages be-\ntween particular cultures and the likelihood of specific symptoms. Rather, clinicians\nshould be aware that in most countries the majority of cases of depression go unrecog-\nnized in primary care settings and that in many cultures, somatic symptoms are very likely\nto constitute the presenting complaint. Among the Criterion A symptoms, insomnia and\nloss of energy are the most uniformly reported.\nMajor Depressive Disorder\n167Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is not a culture-bound syndrome and has been observed\nin individuals in the United States, Europe, India, and Asia. It is unclear as to whether rates\ndiffer by race. Nevertheless, frequency, intensity, and expressivity of symptoms and help-\nseeking patterns may be significantly influenced by cultural factors.There are cultural variations in the degree to which it is considered desirable to tolerate\nseparation, so that demands and opportunities for separation between parents and chil-\ndren are avoided in some cultures. For example, there is wide variation across countries\nand cultures with respect to the age at which it is expected that offspring should leave the\nparental home. It is important to differentiate separation anxiety disorder from the high\nvalue some cultures place on strong interdependence among family members.Children in families who have immigrated to a country where a different language is spo-\nken may refuse to speak the new language because of lack of knowledge of the language.\nIf comprehension of the new language is adequate but refusal to speak persists, a diagno-\nsis of selective mutism may be warranted.In the United States, Asians and Latinos report significantly lower rates of specific phobia\nthan non-Latino whites, African Americans, and Native Americans. In addition to having\nlower prevalence rates of specific phobia, some countries outside of the United States, par-\nticularly Asian and African countries, show differing phobia content, age at onset, and\ngender ratios.The syndrome of taijin kyofusho (e.g., in Japan and Korea) is often characterized by social-\nevaluative concerns, fulfilling criteria for social anxiety disorder, that are associated with\nthe fear that the individual makes other people uncomfortable (e.g., “My gaze upsets peo-\nple so they look away and avoid me”), a fear that is at times experienced with delusional\nintensity. This symptom may also be found in non-Asian settings. Other presentations\nof taijin kyofusho may fulfill criteria for body dysmorphic disorder or delusional disorder.\n206\nAnxiety Disorders\nImmigrant status is associated with significantly lower rates of social anxiety disorder in\nboth Latino and non-Latino white groups. Prevalence rates of social anxiety disorder may\nnot be in line with self-reported social anxiety levels in the same culture—that is, societies\nwith strong collectivistic orientations may report high levels of social anxiety but low prev-\nalence of social anxiety disorder.The rate of fears about mental and somatic symptoms of anxiety appears to vary across\ncultures and may influence the rate of panic attacks and panic disorder. Also, cultural ex-\npectations may influence the classification of panic attacks as expected or unexpected. For\nexample, a Vietnamese individual who has a panic attack after walking out into a windy\nenvironment (trúng gió; “hit by the wind”) may attribute the panic attack to exposure to\nwind as a result of the cultural syndrome that links these two experiences, resulting in clas-\nsification of the panic attack as expected. Various other cultural syndromes are associated\nwith panic disorder, including ataque de nervios (“attack of nerves”) among Latin Ameri-\ncans and khyâl attacks and “soul loss” among Cambodians. Ataque de nervios may involve\ntrembling, uncontrollable screaming or crying, aggressive or suicidal behavior, and deper-\nsonalization or derealization, which may be experienced longer than the few minutes typical\n212\nAnxiety Disorders\nof panic attacks. Some clinical presentations of ataque de nervios fulfill criteria for condi-\ntions other than panic attack (e.g., other specified dissociative disorder). These syndromes\nimpact the symptoms and frequency of panic disorder, including the individual’s attribu-\ntion of unexpectedness, as cultural syndromes may create fear of certain situations, rang-\ning from interpersonal arguments (associated with ataque de nervios), to types of exertion\n(associated with khyâl attacks), to atmospheric wind (associated with trúng gió attacks).\nClarification of the details of cultural attributions may aid in distinguishing expected and\nunexpected panic attacks. For more information regarding cultural syndromes, refer to the\n“Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the Appendix.\nThe specific worries about panic attacks or their consequences are likely to vary from\none culture to another (and across different age groups and gender). For panic disorder,\nU.S. community samples of non-Latino whites have significantly less functional impair-\nment than African Americans. There are also higher rates of objectively defined severity in\nnon-Latino Caribbean blacks with panic disorder, and lower rates of panic disorder over-\nall in both African American and Afro-Caribbean groups, suggesting that among individ-\nuals of African descent, the criteria for panic disorder may be met only when there is\nsubstantial severity and impairment.Cultural interpretations may influence the determination of panic attacks as expected or\nunexpected. Culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, and un-\ncontrollable screaming or crying) may be seen; however, such symptoms should not count\nas one of the four required symptoms. Frequency of each of the 13 symptoms varies cross-\nculturally (e.g., higher rates of paresthesias in African Americans and of dizziness in sev-\neral Asian groups). Cultural syndromes also influence the cross-cultural presentation of\npanic attacks, resulting in different symptom profiles across different cultural groups. Ex-\namples include khyâl (wind) attacks, a Cambodian cultural syndrome involving dizziness,\ntinnitus, and neck soreness; and trúng gió (wind-related) attacks, a Vietnamese cultural\nsyndrome associated with headaches. Ataque de nervios (attack of nerves) is a cultural syn-\ndrome among Latin Americans that may involve trembling, uncontrollable screaming or\ncrying, aggressive or suicidal behavior, and depersonalization or derealization, and which\nmay be experienced for longer than only a few minutes. Some clinical presentations of\nataque de nervios fulfill criteria for conditions other than panic attack (e.g., other specified\ndissociative disorder). Also, cultural expectations may influence the classification of panic\nattacks as expected or unexpected, as cultural syndromes may create fear of certain situa-\ntions, ranging from interpersonal arguments (associated with ataque de nervios), to types of\nexertion (associated with khyâl attacks), to atmospheric wind (associated with trúng gió at-\ntacks). Clarification of the details of cultural attributions may aid in distinguishing ex-\npected and unexpected panic attacks. For more information about cultural syndromes, see\n“Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the Appendix to this manual.There is considerable cultural variation in the expression of generalized anxiety disorder.\nFor example, in some cultures, somatic symptoms predominate in the expression of the\ndisorder, whereas in other cultures cognitive symptoms tend to predominate. This differ-\nence may be more evident on initial presentation than subsequently, as more symptoms\nare reported over time. There is no information as to whether the propensity for excessive\nworrying is related to culture, although the topic being worried about can be culture spe-\ncific. It is important to consider the social and cultural context when evaluating whether\nworries about certain situations are excessive.OCD occurs across the world. There is substantial similarity across cultures in the gender\ndistribution, age at onset, and comorbidity of OCD. Moreover, around the globe, there is a\nsimilar symptom structure involving cleaning, symmetry, hoarding, taboo thoughts, or\nfear of harm. However, regional variation in symptom expression exists, and cultural\nfactors may shape the content of obsessions and compulsions.Body dysmorphic disorder has been reported internationally. It appears that the disorder\nmay have more similarities than differences across races and cultures but that cultural\nvalues and preferences may influence symptom content to some degree. Taijin kyofusho,\nincluded in the traditional Japanese diagnostic system, has a subtype similar to body dys-\nmorphic disorder: shubo-kyofu (“the phobia of a deformed body”).While most of the research has been done in Western, industrialized countries and urban\ncommunities, the available data from non-Western and developing countries suggest that\nhoarding is a universal phenomenon with consistent clinical features.Trichotillomania appears to manifest similarly across cultures, although there is a paucity\nof data from non-Western regions.Similar attachment behaviors have been described in young children in many different\ncultures around the world. However, caution should be exercised in making the diagnosis\nof reactive attachment disorder in cultures in which attachment has not been studied.The risk of onset and severity of PTSD may differ across cultural groups as a result of vari-\nation in the type of traumatic exposure (e.g., genocide), the impact on disorder severity of\nthe meaning attributed to the traumatic event (e.g., inability to perform funerary rites after\na mass killing), the ongoing sociocultural context (e.g., residing among unpunished per-\npetrators in postconflict settings), and other cultural factors (e.g., acculturative stress in\nimmigrants). The relative risk for PTSD of particular exposures (e.g., religious persecu-\ntion) may vary across cultural groups. The clinical expression of the symptoms or symp-\ntom clusters of PTSD may vary culturally, particularly with respect to avoidance and\nnumbing symptoms, distressing dreams, and somatic symptoms (e.g., dizziness, short-\nness of breath, heat sensations).\nCultural syndromes and idioms of distress influence the expression of PTSD and the\nrange of comorbid disorders in different cultures by providing behavioral and cognitive\ntemplates that link traumatic exposures to specific symptoms. For example, panic attack\nsymptoms may be salient in PTSD among Cambodians and Latin Americans because of\nthe association of traumatic exposure with panic-like khyâl attacks and ataque de nervios.\nComprehensive evaluation of local expressions of PTSD should include assessment of cul-\ntural concepts of distress (see the chapter “Cultural Formulation” in Section III).The profile of symptoms of acute stress disorder may vary cross-culturally, particularly\nwith respect to dissociative symptoms, nightmares, avoidance, and somatic symptoms\n(e.g., dizziness, shortness of breath, heat sensations). Cultural syndromes and idioms of\ndistress shape the local symptom profiles of acute stress disorder. Some cultural groups\nmay display variants of dissociative responses, such as possession or trancelike behaviors\nin the initial month after trauma exposure. Panic symptoms may be salient in acute stress\ndisorder among Cambodians because of the association of traumatic exposure with panic-\nlike khyâl attacks, and ataque de nervios among Latin Americans may also follow a traumatic\nexposure.The context of the individual’s cultural setting should be taken into account in making the\nclinical judgment of whether the individual’s response to the stressor is maladaptive or\nwhether the associated distress is in excess of what would be expected. The nature, mean-\ning, and experience of the stressors and the evaluation of the response to the stressors may\nvary across cultures.Many features of dissociative identity disorder can be influenced by the individual’s cul-\ntural background. Individuals with this disorder may present with prominent medically\nunexplained neurological symptoms, such as non-epileptic seizures, paralyses, or sensory\nloss, in cultural settings where such symptoms are common. Similarly, in settings where\nnormative possession is common (e.g., rural areas in the developing world, among certain\nreligious groups in the United States and Europe), the fragmented identities may take the\nform of possessing spirits, deities, demons, animals, or mythical figures. Acculturation or\nprolonged intercultural contact may shape the characteristics of the other identities (e.g.,\nidentities in India may speak English exclusively and wear Western clothes). Possession-\nform dissociative identity disorder can be distinguished from culturally accepted posses-\nsion states in that the former is involuntary, distressing, uncontrollable, and often recur-\nrent or persistent; involves conflict between the individual and his or her surrounding\nfamily, social, or work milieu; and is manifested at times and in places that violate the\nnorms of the culture or religion.In Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, non-epileptic seizures and other functional\nneurological symptoms may accompany dissociative amnesia. In cultures with highly re-\nstrictive social traditions, the precipitants of dissociative amnesia often do not involve\nfrank trauma. Instead, the amnesia is preceded by severe psychological stresses or con-\nflicts (e.g., marital conflict, other family disturbances, attachment problems, conflicts due\nto restriction or oppression).Volitionally induced experiences of depersonalization/derealization can be a part of med-\nitative practices that are prevalent in many religions and cultures and should not be diag-\nnosed as a disorder. However, there are individuals who initially induce these states\nintentionally but over time lose control over them and may develop a fear and aversion for\nrelated practices.Somatic symptoms are prominent in various “culture-bound syndromes.” High numbers\nof somatic symptoms are found in population-based and primary care studies around the\nworld, with a similar pattern of the most commonly reported somatic symptoms, impair-\nment, and treatment seeking. The relationship between number of somatic symptoms and\nillness worry is similar in different cultures, and marked illness worry is associated with\nimpairment and greater treatment seeking across cultures. The relationship between nu-\nmerous somatic symptoms and depression appears to be very similar around the world\nand between different cultures within one country.\nDespite these similarities, there are differences in somatic symptoms among cultures\nand ethnic groups. The description of somatic symptoms varies with linguistic and other\nlocal cultural factors. These somatic presentations have been described as “idioms of dis-\ntress” because somatic symptoms may have special meanings and shape patient-clinician\ninteractions in the particular cultural contexts. “Burnout,” the sensation of heaviness or\nthe complaints of “gas”; too much heat in the body; or burning in the head are examples of\nsymptoms that are common in some cultures or ethnic groups but rare in others. Explan-\natory models also vary, and somatic symptoms may be attributed variously to particular\nfamily, work, or environmental stresses; general medical illness; the suppression of feel-\nings of anger and resentment; or certain culture-specific phenomena, such as semen loss.\nThere may also be differences in medical treatment seeking among cultural groups, in ad-\ndition to differences due to variable access to medical care services. Seeking treatment for\nmultiple somatic symptoms in general medical clinics is a worldwide phenomenon and\noccurs at similar rates among ethnic groups in the same country.The diagnosis should be made with caution in individuals whose ideas about disease are\ncongruent with widely held, culturally sanctioned beliefs. Little is known about the phe-\nnomenology of the disorder across cultures, although the prevalence appears to be similar\nacross different countries with diverse cultures.Changes resembling conversion (and dissociative) symptoms are common in certain\nculturally sanctioned rituals. If the symptoms are fully explained within the particular\ncultural context and do not result in clinically significant distress or disability, then the di-\nagnosis of conversion disorder is not made.Many differences between cultures may influence psychological factors and their effects\non medical conditions, such as those in language and communication style, explanatory\nmodels of illness, patterns of seeking health care, service availability and organization,\ndoctor-patient relationships and other healing practices, family and gender roles, and at-\ntitudes toward pain and death. Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions\nmust be differentiated from culturally specific behaviors such as using faith or spiritual\nhealers or other variations in illness management that are acceptable within a culture and\nrepresent an attempt to help the medical condition rather than interfere with it. These local\npractices may complement rather than obstruct evidence-based interventions. If they do\nnot adversely affect outcomes, they should not be pathologized as psychological factors\naffecting other medical conditions.In some populations, the eating of earth or other seemingly nonnutritive substances is believed\nto be of spiritual, medicinal, or other social value, or may be a culturally supported or socially\nnormative practice. Such behavior does not warrant a diagnosis of pica (Criterion C).Presentations similar to avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder occur in various popu-\nlations, including in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe. Avoidant/restrictive\nfood intake disorder should not be diagnosed when avoidance of food intake is solely re-\nlated to specific religious or cultural practices.Anorexia nervosa occurs across culturally and socially diverse populations, although available\nevidence suggests cross-cultural variation in its occurrence and presentation. Anorexia ner-\nvosa is probably most prevalent in post-industrialized, high-income countries such as in the\nUnited States, many European countries, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, but its incidence\nin most low- and middle-income countries is uncertain. Whereas the prevalence of anorexia\nnervosa appears comparatively low among Latinos, African Americans, and Asians in the\nUnited States, clinicians should be aware that mental health service utilization among individ-\nuals with an eating disorder is significantly lower in these ethnic groups and that the low rates\nmay reflect an ascertainment bias. The presentation of weight concerns among individuals\nwith eating and feeding disorders varies substantially across cultural contexts. The absence of\nan expressed intense fear of weight gain, sometimes referred to as “fat phobia,” appears to be\nrelatively more common in populations in Asia, where the rationale for dietary restriction is\ncommonly related to a more culturally sanctioned complaint such as gastrointestinal discom-\nfort. Within the United States, presentations without a stated intense fear of weight gain may\nbe comparatively more common among Latino groups.Bulimia nervosa has been reported to occur with roughly similar frequencies in most in-\ndustrialized countries, including the United States, Canada, many European countries,\nAustralia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Africa. In clinical studies of bulimia nervosa in\nthe United States, individuals presenting with this disorder are primarily white. However,\nthe disorder also occurs in other ethnic groups and with prevalence comparable to esti-\nmated prevalences observed in white samples.Binge-eating disorder occurs with roughly similar frequencies in most industrialized\ncountries, including the United States, Canada, many European countries, Australia, and\nNew Zealand. In the United States, the prevalence of binge-eating disorder appears com-\nparable among non-Latino whites, Latinos, Asians, and African Americans.Enuresis has been reported in a variety of European, African, and Asian countries as well\nas in the United States. At a national level, prevalence rates are remarkably similar, and\nthere is great similarity in the developmental trajectories found in different countries.\nThere are very high rates of enuresis in orphanages and other residential institutions,\nlikely related to the mode and environment in which toilet training occurs.Narcolepsy has been described in all ethnic groups and in many cultures. Among African\nAmericans, more cases present without cataplexy or with atypical cataplexy, complicating\ndiagnosis, especially in the presence of obesity and obstructive sleep apnea.There is a potential for sleepiness and fatigue to be reported differently across cultures. In\nsome groups, snoring may be considered a sign of health and thus may not trigger con-\ncerns. Individuals of Asian ancestry may be at increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea despite relatively low BMI, possibly reflecting the influence of craniofacial risk\nfactors that narrow the nasopharynx.\nGender-Related Issues\nFemales may more commonly report fatigue rather than sleepiness and may underreport\nsnoring.African Americans may have a shorter circadian period and larger magnitude phase ad-\nvances to light than do Caucasians, possibly increasing the risk for development of ad-\nvanced sleep phase type in this population.The significance attributed to nightmares may vary by culture, and sensitivity to such be-\nliefs may facilitate disclosure.The consumption of substances, including prescribed medications, may depend in part on\ncultural background and specific local drug regulations.Complaints of ejaculatory delay vary across countries and cultures. Such complaints are\nmore common among men in Asian populations than in men living in Europe, Australia,\nor the United States. This variation may be attributable to cultural or genetic differences\nbetween cultures.Complaints of erectile disorder have been found to vary across countries. It is unclear to\nwhat extent these differences represent differences in cultural expectations as opposed to\ngenuine differences in the frequency of erectile failure.The degree to which lack of orgasm in women is regarded as a problem that requires treat-\nment may vary depending on cultural context. In addition, women differ in how important\norgasm is to their sexual satisfaction. There may be marked sociocultural and generational\ndifferences in women’s orgasmic ability. For example, the prevalence of inability to reach or-\ngasm has ranged from 17.7% (in Northern Europe) to 42.2% (in Southeast Asia).There is marked variability in prevalence rates of low desire across cultures. Lower rates of\nsexual desire may be more common among East Asian women compared with Euro-\nCanadian women. Although the lower levels of sexual desire and arousal found in men\nand women from East Asian countries compared with Euro-American groups may reflect\nless interest in sex in those cultures, the possibility remains that such group differences are\nan artifact of the measures used to quantify desire. A judgment about whether low sexual\n436\nSexual Dysfunctions\ndesire reported by a woman from a certain ethnocultural group meets criteria for female\nsexual interest/arousal disorder must take into account the fact that different cultures may\npathologize some behaviors and not others.In the past, inadequate sexual education and religious orthodoxy have often been consid-\nered to be culturally related predisposing factors to the DSM-IV diagnosis of vaginismus.\nThis perception appears to be confirmed by recent reports from Turkey, a primarily Mus-\nlim country, indicating a strikingly high prevalence for the disorder. However, most avail-\nable research, although limited in scope, does not support this notion (Lahaie et al. 2010).There is marked variability in prevalence rates of low desire across cultures, ranging from\n12.5% in Northern European men to 28% in Southeast Asian men ages 40–80 years. Just as\nthere are higher rates of low desire among East Asian subgroups of women, men of East\nAsian ancestry also have higher rates of low desire. Guilt about sex may mediate this as-\nsociation between East Asian ethnicity and sexual desire in men.Perception of what constitutes a normal ejaculatory latency is different in many cultures.\nMeasured ejaculatory latencies may differ in some countries. Such differences may be ex-\nplained by cultural or religious factors as well as genetic differences between populations.There may be an interaction among cultural factors, the influence of medications on sexual\nfunctioning, and the response of the individual to those changes.Individuals with gender dysphoria have been reported across many countries and cul-\ntures. The equivalent of gender dysphoria has also been reported in individuals living in\ncultures with institutionalized gender categories other than male or female. It is unclear\nwhether with these individuals the diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria would be met.The prevalence of the disorder in children and adolescents is relatively consistent across\ncountries that differ in race and ethnicity.The lower prevalence of intermittent explosive disorder in some regions (Asia, Middle\nEast) or countries (Romania, Nigeria), compared with the United States, suggests that in-\nformation about recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive behaviors either is not elic-\nited on questioning or is less likely to be present, because of cultural factors.Conduct disorder diagnosis may at times be potentially misapplied to individuals in set-\ntings where patterns of disruptive behavior are viewed as near-normative (e.g., in very\nthreatening, high-crime areas or war zones). Therefore, the context in which the undesir-\nable behaviors have occurred should be considered.", "gender_issues": "Specific learning disorder is more common in males than in females (ratios range from\nabout 2:1 to 3:1) and cannot be attributed to factors such as ascertainment bias, definitional\nor measurement variation, language, race, or socioeconomic status.Males are more commonly affected than females, but there are no gender differences in the\nkinds of tics, age at onset, or course. Women with persistent tic disorders may be more\nlikely to experience anxiety and depression.A number of features distinguish the clinical expression of schizophrenia in females and\nmales. The general incidence of schizophrenia tends to be slightly lower in females, par-\nticularly among treated cases. The age at onset is later in females, with a second mid-life\npeak as described earlier (see the section “Development and Course” for this disorder).\nSymptoms tend to be more affect-laden among females, and there are more psychotic\nsymptoms, as well as a greater propensity for psychotic symptoms to worsen in later life.\n104\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\nOther symptom differences include less frequent negative symptoms and disorganization.\nFinally, social functioning tends to remain better preserved in females. There are, how-\never, frequent exceptions to these general caveats.Females are more likely to experience rapid cycling and mixed states, and to have patterns ofWhereas the gender ratio for bipolar I disorder is equal, findings on gender differences in\nbipolar II disorder are mixed, differing by type of sample (i.e., registry, community, or\nclinical) and country of origin. There is little to no evidence of bipolar gender differences,\nwhereas some, but not all, clinical samples suggest that bipolar II disorder is more com-\nmon in females than in males, which may reflect gender differences in treatment seeking\nor other factors.\nPatterns of illness and comorbidity, however, seem to differ by gender, with females\nbeing more likely than males to report hypomania with mixed depressive features and a\nrapid-cycling course. Childbirth may be a specific trigger for a hypomanic episode, which\ncan occur in 10%–20% of females in nonclinical populations and most typically in the early\npostpartum period. Distinguishing hypomania from the elated mood and reduced sleep\nthat normally accompany the birth of a child may be challenging. Postpartum hypomania\nmay foreshadow the onset of a depression that occurs in about half of females who expe-\nrience postpartum “highs.” Accurate detection of bipolar II disorder may help in estab-\nlishing appropriate treatment of the depression, which may reduce the risk of suicide and\ninfanticide.\n138\nBipolar and Related DisordersGender differences pertain to those associated with the medical condition (e.g., systemic\nlupus erythematosus is more common in females; stroke is somewhat more common in\nmiddle-age males compared with females).Children presenting to clinics with features of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are\npredominantly male. Among community samples, a male preponderance appears to be\nsupported. This difference in prevalence between males and females differentiates disrup-\ntive mood dysregulation disorder from bipolar disorder, in which there is an equal genderAlthough the most reproducible finding in the epidemiology of major depressive disorder\nhas been a higher prevalence in females, there are no clear differences between genders in\nsymptoms, course, treatment response, or functional consequences. In women, the risk for\nsuicide attempts is higher, and the risk for suicide completion is lower. The disparity in\nsuicide rate by gender is not as great among those with depressive disorders as it is in the\npopulation as a whole.Gender differences pertain to those associated with the medical condition (e.g., systemic\nlupus erythematosus is more common in females; stroke is somewhat more common in\nmiddle-age males compared with females).Girls manifest greater reluctance to attend or avoidance of school than boys. Indirect ex-\npression of fear of separation may be more common in males than in females, for example,\nby limited independent activity, reluctance to be away from home alone, or distress when\nspouse or offspring do things independently or when contact with spouse or offspring is\nnot possible.Females with social anxiety disorder report a greater number of social fears and comorbid\ndepressive, bipolar, and anxiety disorders, whereas males are more likely to fear dating,\nhave oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder, and use alcohol and illicit drugs to\nrelieve symptoms of the disorder. Paruresis is more common in males.The clinical features of panic disorder do not appear to differ between males and females.\nThere is some evidence for sexual dimorphism, with an association between panic disor-\nder and the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene in females only.Panic attacks are more common in females than in males, but clinical features or symp-\ntoms of panic attacks do not differ between males and females.Females have different patterns of comorbid disorders than males. Consistent with gender\ndifferences in the prevalence of mental disorders, males have higher rates of comorbid\nsubstance use disorders.In clinical settings, generalized anxiety disorder is diagnosed somewhat more frequently\nin females than in males (about 55%–60% of those presenting with the disorder are\nfemale). In epidemiological studies, approximately two-thirds are female. Females and\nmales who experience generalized anxiety disorder appear to have similar symptoms but\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder\n225\ndemonstrate different patterns of comorbidity consistent with gender differences in theMales have an earlier age at onset of OCD than females and are more likely to have co-\nmorbid tic disorders. Gender differences in the pattern of symptom dimensions have been\nreported, with, for example, females more likely to have symptoms in the cleaning dimen-\nsion and males more likely to have symptoms in the forbidden thoughts and symmetry di-\nmensions. Onset or exacerbation of OCD, as well as symptoms that can interfere with the\nmother-infant relationship (e.g., aggressive obsessions leading to avoidance of the infant),\nhave been reported in the peripartum period.Females and males appear to have more similarities than differences in terms of most clin-\nical features— for example, disliked body areas, types of repetitive behaviors, symptom\nseverity, suicidality, comorbidity, illness course, and receipt of cosmetic procedures for\nbody dysmorphic disorder. However, males are more likely to have genital preoccupa-\ntions, and females are more likely to have a comorbid eating disorder. Muscle dysmorphia\noccurs almost exclusively in males.The key features of hoarding disorder (i.e., difficulties discarding, excessive amount of\nclutter) are generally comparable in males and females, but females tend to display more\nexcessive acquisition, particularly excessive buying, than do males.PTSD is more prevalent among females than among males across the lifespan. Females in\nthe general population experience PTSD for a longer duration than do males. At least some\nof the increased risk for PTSD in females appears to be attributable to a greater likelihood\nof exposure to traumatic events, such as rape, and other forms of interpersonal violence.\nWithin populations exposed specifically to such stressors, gender differences in risk for\nPTSD are attenuated or nonsignificant.Acute stress disorder is more prevalent among females than among males. Sex-linked neu-\nrobiological differences in stress response may contribute to females’ increased risk for\nacute stress disorder. The increased risk for the disorder in females may be attributable in\npart to a greater likelihood of exposure to the types of traumatic events with a high con-\nditional risk for acute stress disorder, such as rape and other interpersonal violence.Females with dissociative identity disorder predominate in adult clinical settings but not\nin child clinical settings. Adult males with dissociative identity disorder may deny their\nsymptoms and trauma histories, and this can lead to elevated rates of false negative di-\nagnosis. Females with dissociative identity disorder present more frequently with acute\ndissociative states (e.g., flashbacks, amnesia, fugue, functional neurological [conversion]\nsymptoms, hallucinations, self-mutilation). Males commonly exhibit more criminal or vi-\nolent behavior than females; among males, common triggers of acute dissociative states in-\nclude combat, prison conditions, and physical or sexual assaults.Conversion disorder is two to three times more common in females.\nConversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder)\n321Pica occurs in both males and females. It can occur in females during pregnancy; however,\nlittle is known about the course of pica in the postpartum period.Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is equally common in males and females in in-\nfancy and early childhood, but avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder comorbid with\nautism spectrum disorder has a male predominance. Food avoidance or restriction related\nto altered sensory sensitivities can occur in some physiological conditions, most notably\npregnancy, but is not usually extreme and does not meet full criteria for the disorder.Bulimia nervosa is far more common in females than in males. Males are especially under-\nrepresented in treatment-seeking samples, for reasons that have not yet been systemati-\ncally examined.Nocturnal enuresis is more common in males. Diurnal incontinence is more common in fe-\nmales. The relative risk of having a child who develops enuresis is greater for previously\nenuretic fathers than for previously enuretic mothers.Insomnia is a more prevalent complaint among females than among males, with first onset\noften associated with the birth of a new child or with menopause. Despite higher preva-\nlence among older females, polysomnographic studies suggest better preservation of\nsleep continuity and slow-wave sleep in older females than in older males.Gender distributions for sleep-related hypoventilation occurring in association with co-\nmorbid conditions reflect the gender distributions of the comorbid conditions. For exam-\nple, COPD is more frequently present in males and with increasing age.Violent or sexual activity during sleepwalking episodes is more likely to occur in adults.\nEating during sleepwalking episodes is more commonly seen in females. Sleepwalking oc-\ncurs more often in females during childhood but more often in males during adulthood.\nOlder children and adults provide a more detailed recollection of fearful images asso-\nciated with sleep terrors than do younger children, who are more likely to have complete\namnesia or report only a vague sense of fear. Among children, sleep terrors are more com-\nmon in males than in females. Among adults, the sex ratio is even.\n402\nSleep-Wake DisordersAdult females report having nightmares more frequently than do adult males. Nightmare\ncontent differs by sex, with adult females tending to report themes of sexual harassment or\nof loved ones disappearing/dying, and adult males tending to report themes of physical\naggression or war/terror.Although RLS is more prevalent in females than in males, there are no diagnostic differ-\nences according to gender. However, the prevalence of RLS during pregnancy is two to\nthree times greater than in the general population. RLS associated with pregnancy peaks\nduring the third trimester and improves or resolves in most cases soon after delivery. The\ngender difference in prevalence of RLS is explained at least in part by parity, with nullipa-\nrous females being at the same risk of RLS as age-matched males.Gender-specific prevalences (i.e., females affected more than males at a ratio of about 2:1) exist\nfor patterns of consumption of some substances (e.g., alcohol). The same amount and duration\nof consumption of a given substance may lead to highly different sleep-related outcomes in\nmales and females based on, for example, gender-specific differences in hepatic functioning.\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder\n419By definition, the diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder is only given to\nwomen. Distressing difficulties with sexual desire in men would be considered under\nmale hypoactive sexual desire disorder.By definition, the diagnosis of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder is only given to\nwomen. There is relatively new research concerning urological chronic pelvic pain syn-\ndrome in men, suggesting that men may experience some similar problems. The research\nand clinical experience are not sufficiently developed yet to justify the application of this\ndiagnosis to men. Other specified sexual dysfunction or unspecified sexual dysfunction\nmay be diagnosed in men appearing to fit this pattern.In contrast to the classification of sexual disorders in women, desire and arousal disorders\nhave been retained as separate constructs in men. Despite some similarities in the experi-\nPremature (Early) Ejaculation\n443\nence of desire across men and women, and the fact that desire fluctuates over time and is\ndependent on contextual factors, men do report a significantly higher intensity and fre-\nquency of sexual desire compared with women.Premature (early) ejaculation is a sexual disorder in males. Males and their sexual partners\nmay differ in their perception of what constitutes an acceptable ejaculatory latency. There\nmay be increasing concerns in females about early ejaculation in their sexual partners,\nwhich may be a reflection of changing societal attitudes concerning female sexual activity.Some gender differences in sexual side effects may exist.\n450\nSexual DysfunctionsIn some studies the prevalence of intermittent explosive disorder is greater in males than\nin females (odds ratio = 1.4–2.3); other studies have found no gender difference.Males with a diagnosis of conduct disorder frequently exhibit fighting, stealing, vandalism,\nand school discipline problems. Females with a diagnosis of conduct disorder are more likely\nto exhibit lying, truancy, running away, substance use, and prostitution. Whereas males tend\nto exhibit both physical aggression and relational aggression (behavior that harms social re-\nlationships of others), females tend to exhibit relatively more relational aggression.Pyromania occurs much more often in males, especially those with poorer social skills and\nlearning difficulties.", "diagnostic_markers": "With substances for which relevant blood levels are available (e.g., blood alcohol level,\nother quantifiable blood levels such as digoxin), the presence of a level consistent with tox-\nicity may increase diagnostic certainty.The diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition depends on the clin-\nical condition of each individual, and the diagnostic tests will vary according to that con-\ndition. A variety of medical conditions may cause psychotic symptoms. These include\nneurological conditions (e.g., neoplasms, cerebrovascular disease, Huntington's disease,\nmultiple sclerosis, epilepsy, auditory or visual nerve injury or impairment, deafness,\nmigraine, central nervous system infections), endocrine conditions (e.g., hyper- and hypo-\nthyroidism, hyper- and hypoparathyroidism, hyper- and hypoadrenocorticism), metabolic\nconditions (e.g., hypoxia, hypercarbia, hypoglycemia), fluid or electrolyte imbalances,\nhepatic or renal diseases, and autoimmune disorders with central nervous system involve-\nment (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus). The associated physical examination findings,\nlaboratory findings, and patterns of prevalence or onset reflect the etiological medical\ncondition.\n118\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic DisordersDetermination of the substance of use can be made through markers in the blood or urine\nto corroborate diagnosis.levels in blood or urine to help corroborate the diagnosis of Cushing’s disease, which can\nbe associated with manic or depressive syndromes; laboratory tests confirming the diag-\nnosis of multiple sclerosis).As indicated earlier, the diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is appropriately\nconfirmed by 2 months of prospective symptom ratings. A number of scales, including the\n174\nDepressive Disorders\nDaily Rating of Severity of Problems and the Visual Analogue Scales for Premenstrual\nMood Symptoms, have undergone validation and are commonly used in clinical trials for\npremenstrual dysphoric disorder. The Premenstrual Tension Syndrome Rating Scale has a\nself-report and an observer version, both of which have been validated and used widely to\nmeasure illness severity in women who have premenstrual dysphoric disorder.Determination of the substance of use can sometimes be made through laboratory assays\nof the suspected substance in the blood or urine to corroborate the diagnosis.levels in blood or urine to help corroborate the diagnosis of Cushing’s disease, which can\nbe associated with manic or depressive syndromes).Agents with disparate mechanisms of action, such as sodium lactate, caffeine, isoprotere-\nnol, yohimbine, carbon dioxide, and cholecystokinin, provoke panic attacks in individuals\nwith panic disorder to a much greater extent than in healthy control subjects (and in some\ncases, than in individuals with other anxiety, depressive, or bipolar disorders without\npanic attacks). Also, for a proportion of individuals with panic disorder, panic attacks are\nrelated to hypersensitive medullary carbon dioxide detectors, resulting in hypocapnia and\nother respiratory irregularities. However, none of these laboratory findings are consid-\nered diagnostic of panic disorder.Physiological recordings of naturally occurring panic attacks in individuals with panic\ndisorder indicate abrupt surges of arousal, usually of heart rate, that reach a peak within\nminutes and subside within minutes, and for a proportion of these individuals the panic\nattack may be preceded by cardiorespiratory instabilities.\nAgoraphobia\n217Laboratory assessments (e.g., urine toxicology) may be useful to measure substance intox-\nication as part of an assessment for substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder.Laboratory assessments and/or medical examinations are necessary to confirm the diag-\nnosis of the associated medical condition.Most individuals with trichotillomania admit to hair pulling; thus, dermatopathological\ndiagnosis is rarely required. Skin biopsy and dermoscopy (or trichoscopy) of trichotillo-\nmania are able to differentiate the disorder from other causes of alopecia. In trichotil-\nlomania, dermoscopy shows a range of characteristic features, including decreased hair\ndensity, short vellus hair, and broken hairs with different shaft lengths.Most individuals with excoriation disorder admit to skin picking; therefore, dermato-\npathological diagnosis is rarely required. However, the disorder may have characteristic\nfeatures on histopathology.\n256\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related DisordersLaboratory assessments and/or medical examinations are necessary to confirm the diag-\nnosis of another medical condition.Abdominal flat plate radiography, ultrasound, and other scanning methods may reveal\nobstructions related to pica. Blood tests and other laboratory tests can be used to ascertain\nlevels of poisoning or the nature of infection.tificial nutrition in the absence of any clear medical condition other than poor intake.The following laboratory abnormalities may be observed in anorexia nervosa; their pres-\nence may serve to increase diagnostic confidence.\nAnorexia Nervosa\n343\nHematology.\nLeukopenia is common, with the loss of all cell types but usually with ap-\nparent lymphocytosis. Mild anemia can occur, as well as thrombocytopenia and, rarely,\nbleeding problems.\nSerum chemistry.\nDehydration may be reflected by an elevated blood urea nitrogen\nlevel. Hypercholesterolemia is common. Hepatic enzyme levels may be elevated. Hypo-\nmagnesemia, hypozincemia, hypophosphatemia, and hyperamylasemia are occasionally\nobserved. Self-induced vomiting may lead to metabolic alkalosis (elevated serum bicarbon-\nate), hypochloremia, and hypokalemia; laxative abuse may cause a mild metabolic acidosis.\nEndocrine.\nSerum thyroxine (T4) levels are usually in the low-normal range; triiodothy-\nronine (T3) levels are decreased, while reverse T3 levels are elevated. Females have low se-\nrum estrogen levels, whereas males have low levels of serum testosterone.\nElectrocardiography.\nSinus bradycardia is common, and, rarely, arrhythmias are noted.\nSignificant prolongation of the QTc interval is observed in some individuals.\nBone mass.\nLow bone mineral density, with specific areas of osteopenia or osteoporo-\nsis, is often seen. The risk of fracture is significantly elevated.\nElectroencephalography.\nDiffuse abnormalities, reflecting a metabolic encephalopa-\nthy, may result from significant fluid and electrolyte disturbances.\nResting energy expenditure.\nThere is often a significant reduction in resting energy ex-\npenditure.\nPhysical signs and symptoms.\nMany of the physical signs and symptoms of anorexia\nnervosa are attributable to starvation. Amenorrhea is commonly present and appears to\nbe an indicator of physiological dysfunction. If present, amenorrhea is usually a conse-\nquence of the weight loss, but in a minority of individuals it may actually precede the\nweight loss. In prepubertal females, menarche may be delayed. In addition to amenorrhea,\nthere may be complaints of constipation, abdominal pain, cold intolerance, lethargy, and\nexcess energy.\nThe most remarkable finding on physical examination is emaciation. Commonly, there\nis also significant hypotension, hypothermia, and bradycardia. Some individuals develop\nlanugo, a fine downy body hair. Some develop peripheral edema, especially during\nweight restoration or upon cessation of laxative and diuretic abuse. Rarely, petechiae or\necchymoses, usually on the extremities, may indicate a bleeding diathesis. Some individ-\nuals evidence a yellowing of the skin associated with hypercarotenemia. As may be seen in\nindividuals with bulimia nervosa, individuals with anorexia nervosa who self-induce\nvomiting may have hypertrophy of the salivary glands, particularly the parotid glands, as\nwell as dental enamel erosion. Some individuals may have scars or calluses on the dorsal\nsurface of the hand from repeated contact with the teeth while inducing vomiting.No specific diagnostic test for bulimia nervosa currently exists. However, several labora-\ntory abnormalities may occur as a consequence of purging and may increase diagnostic\ncertainty. These include fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypokalemia (which\ncan provoke cardiac arrhythmias), hypochloremia, and hyponatremia. The loss of gastric\nacid through vomiting may produce a metabolic alkalosis (elevated serum bicarbonate),\nand the frequent induction of diarrhea or dehydration through laxative and diuretic abuse\ncan cause metabolic acidosis. Some individuals with bulimia nervosa exhibit mildly ele-\nvated levels of serum amylase, probably reflecting an increase in the salivary isoenzyme.\nPhysical examination usually yields no physical findings. However, inspection of the\nmouth may reveal significant and permanent loss of dental enamel, especially from lin-\ngual surfaces of the front teeth due to recurrent vomiting. These teeth may become\nchipped and appear ragged and “moth-eaten.” There may also be an increased frequency\nof dental caries. In some individuals, the salivary glands, particularly the parotid glands,\nmay become notably enlarged. Individuals who induce vomiting by manually stimulating\nthe gag reflex may develop calluses or scars on the dorsal surface of the hand from re-\npeated contact with the teeth. Serious cardiac and skeletal myopathies have been reported\namong individuals following repeated use of syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting.\nBulimia Nervosa\n349In addition to physical examination, gastrointestinal imaging (e.g., abdominal radiograph)\nmay be informative to assess retained stool and gas in the colon. Additional tests, such as\nbarium enema and anorectal manography, may be used to help exclude other medical\nconditions, such as Hirschsprung’s disease.Polysomnography usually shows impairments of sleep continuity (e.g., increased sleep la-\ntency and time awake after sleep onset and decreased sleep efficiency [percentage of time\nin bed asleep] and may show increased stage 1 sleep and decreased stages 3 and 4 sleep.\nThe severity of these sleep impairments does not always match the individual’s clinical\npresentation or subjective complaint of poor sleep, as individuals with insomnia often un-\nderestimate sleep duration and overestimate wakefulness relative to polysomnography.\nQuantitative electroencephalographic analyses may indicate that individuals with insom-\nnia have greater high-frequency electroencephalography power relative to good sleepers\nboth around the sleep onset period and during non–rapid eye movement sleep, a feature\nsuggestive of increased cortical arousal. Individuals with insomnia disorder may have a\nlower sleep propensity and typically do not show increased daytime sleepiness on objec-\ntive sleep laboratory measures compared with individuals without sleep disorders.\nOther laboratory measures show evidence, although not consistently, of increased\narousal and a generalized activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (e.g., in-\ncreased cortisol levels, heart rate variability, reactivity to stress, metabolic rate). In general,\nfindings are consistent with the hypothesis that increased physiological and cognitive\narousal plays a significant role in insomnia disorder.\nIndividuals with insomnia disorder may appear either fatigued or haggard or, con-\nversely, overaroused and “wired.” However, there are no consistent or characteristic\nabnormalities on physical examination. There may be an increased incidence of stress-\nInsomnia Disorder\n367\nrelated psychophysiological symptoms (e.g., tension headache, muscle tension or pain,\ngastrointestinal symptoms).Nocturnal polysomnography demonstrates a normal to prolonged sleep duration, short\nsleep latency, and normal to increased sleep continuity. The distribution of rapid eye\nmovement (REM) sleep is also normal. Sleep efficiency is mostly greater than 90%. Some\nindividuals with hypersomnolence disorder have increased amounts of slow-wave sleep.\nThe multiple sleep latency test documents sleep tendency, typically indicated by mean\nsleep latency values of less than 8 minutes. In hypersomnolence disorder, the mean sleep\nlatency is typically less than 10 minutes and frequently 8 minutes or less. Sleep-onset REM\nperiods (SOREMPs; i.e., the occurrence of REM sleep within 20 minutes of sleep onset)\nmay be present but occur less than two times in four to five nap opportunities.Functional imaging suggests impaired hypothalamic responses to humorous stimuli.\nNocturnal polysomnography followed by an MSLT is used to confirm the diagnosis of\nnarcolepsy, especially when the disorder is first being diagnosed and before treatment has\nbegun, and if hypocretin deficiency has not been documented biochemically. The poly-\nsomnography/MSLT should be performed after the individual is no longer taking any\npsychotropic drugs and after regular sleep-wake patterns, without shift work or sleep de-\nprivation, have been documented.\nA sleep-onset REM period during the polysomnography (REM sleep latency less than\nor equal to 15 minutes) is highly specific (approximately 1% positive in control subjects)\nbut moderately sensitive (approximately 50%). A positive MSLT result displays an aver-\nage sleep latency of less than or equal to 8 minutes, and sleep-onset REM periods in two or\nmore naps on a four- or five-nap test. The MSLT result is positive in 90%–95% of individ-\nuals with narcolepsy versus 2%–4% of control subjects or individuals with other sleep dis-\norders. Additional polysomnographic findings often include frequent arousals, decreased\nsleep efficiency, and increased stage 1 sleep. Periodic limb movements (found in about\n40% of individuals with narcolepsy) and sleep apnea are often noted.\nHypocretin deficiency is demonstrated by measuring CSF hypocretin-1 immunoreac-\ntivity. The test is particularly useful in individuals with suspected conversion disorder\nand those without typical cataplexy, or in treatment-refractory cases. The diagnostic value\nof the test is not affected by medications, sleep deprivation, or circadian time, but the find-\nings are uninterpretable when the individual is severely ill with a concurrent infection or\nhead trauma or is comatose. CSF cytology, protein, and glucose are within normal range\neven when sampled within weeks of rapid onset. CSF hypocretin-1 in these incipient cases\nis typically already very diminished or undetectable.Polysomnography provides quantitative data on frequency of sleep-related respiratory\ndisturbances and associated changes in oxygen saturation and sleep continuity. Polysom-\nnographic findings in children differ from those in adults in that children demonstrate\nlabored breathing, partial obstructive hypoventilation with cyclical desaturations, hyper-\ncapnia and paradoxical movements. Apnea hypopnea index levels as low as 2 are used to\ndefine thresholds of abnormality in children.\nArterial blood gas measurements while the individual is awake are usually normal, but\nsome individuals can have waking hypoxemia or hypercapnia. This pattern should alert the\nclinician to the possibility of coexisting lung disease or hypoventilation. Imaging procedures\nmay reveal narrowing of the upper airway. Cardiac testing may show evidence of impaired\nventricular function. Individuals with severe nocturnal oxygen desaturation may also have el-\nevated hemoglobin or hematocrit values. Validated sleep measures (e.g., multiple sleep la-\ntency test [MSLT], maintenance of wakefulness test) may identify sleepiness.Physical findings seen in individuals with a Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern relate to its\nrisk factors. Findings consistent with heart failure, such as jugular venous distension, S3\nheart sound, lung crackles, and lower extremity edema, may be present. Polysomnogra-\nphy is used to characterize the breathing characteristics of each breathing-related sleep\ndisorder subtype. Central sleep apneas are recorded when periods of breathing cessation\nfor longer than 10 seconds occur. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is characterized by a pattern of\nperiodic crescendo-decrescendo variation in tidal volume that results in central apneas\nand hypopneas occurring at a frequency of at least five events per hour that are accompa-\nnied by frequent arousals. The cycle length of Cheyne-Stokes breathing (or time from end\nof one central apnea to the end of the next apnea) is about 60 seconds.\n386\nSleep-Wake DisordersSleep-related hypoventilation is diagnosed using polysomnography showing sleep-related\nhypoxemia and hypercapnia that is not better explained by another breathing-related sleep\ndisorder. The documentation of increased arterial pCO2 levels to greater than 55 mmHg\nduring sleep or a 10 mmHg or greater increase in pCO2 levels (to a level that also exceeds\n50 mmHg) during sleep in comparison to awake supine values, for 10 minutes or longer, is\nthe gold standard for diagnosis. However, obtaining arterial blood gas determinations dur-\ning sleep is impractical, and non-invasive measures of pCO2 have not been adequately val-\nidated during sleep and are not widely used during polysomnography in adults. Prolonged\nand sustained decreases in oxygen saturation (oxygen saturation of less than 90% for more\nthan 5 minutes with a nadir of at least 85%, or oxygen saturation of less than 90% for at least\n30% of sleep time) in the absence of evidence of upper airway obstruction are often used as\nan indication of sleep-related hypoventilation; however, this finding is not specific, as there\nare other potential causes of hypoxemia, such as that due to lung disease.Confirmation of the diagnosis includes a complete history and use of a sleep diary or actigra-\nphy (i.e., a wrist-worn motion detector that monitors motor activity for prolonged periods and\ncan be used as a proxy for sleep-wake patterns for at least 7 days). The period covered should\ninclude weekends, when social and occupational obligations are less strict, to ensure that the\nindividual exhibits a consistently delayed sleep-wake pattern. Biomarkers such as salivary\ndim light melatonin onset should be obtained only when the diagnosis is unclear.A sleep diary and actigraphy may be used as diagnostic markers, as described earlier for\ndelayed sleep phase type.A detailed sleep history and a sleep diary (by a caregiver) or actigraphy help confirm the\nirregular sleep-wake pattern.Diagnosis is confirmed by history and sleep diary or actigraphy for an extended period.\nSequential measurement of phase markers (e.g., melatonin) can help determine circadian\nphase in both sighted and blind individuals.A history and sleep diary or actigraphy may be useful in diagnosis, as discussed earlier for\ndelayed sleep phase type.NREM sleep arousal disorders arise from any stage of NREM sleep but most commonly\nfrom deep NREM sleep (slow-wave sleep). They are most likely to appear in the first third\nof the night and do not commonly occur during daytime naps. During the episode, the\npolysomnogram may be obscured with movement artifact. In the absence of such artifact,\nthe electroencephalogram typically shows theta or alpha frequency activity during the ep-\nisode, indicating partial or incomplete arousal.\nPolysomnography in conjunction with audiovisual monitoring can be used to document\nepisodes of sleepwalking. In the absence of actually capturing an event during a polysomno-\ngraphic recording, there are no polysomnographic features that can serve as a marker for\nsleepwalking. Sleep deprivation may increase the likelihood of capturing an event. As a group,\nindividuals who sleepwalk show instability of deep NREM sleep, but the overlap in findings\nwith individuals who do not sleepwalk is great enough to preclude use of this indicator in es-\ntablishing a diagnosis. Unlike arousals from REM sleep associated with nightmares, in which\nthere is an increase in heart rate and respiration prior to the arousal, the NREM sleep arousals\nof sleep terrors begin precipitously from sleep, without anticipatory autonomic changes. The\narousals are associated with impressive autonomic activity, with doubling or tripling of\nthe heart rate. The pathophysiology is poorly understood, but there appears to be instability in\nthe deeper stages of NREM sleep. Absent capturing an event during a formal sleep study,\nthere are no reliable polysomnographic indicators of the tendency to experience sleep terrors.Polysomnographic studies demonstrate abrupt awakenings from REM sleep, usually during\nthe second half of the night, prior to report of a nightmare. Heart, respiratory, and eye move-\nment rates may quicken or increase in variability before awakening. Nightmares following\ntraumatic events may also arise during non-REM (NREM), particularly stage 2, sleep. The typ-\nical sleep of individuals with nightmares is mildly impaired (e.g., reduced efficiency, less slow-\nwave sleep, more awakenings), with more frequent periodic leg movements in sleep and rel-\native sympathetic nervous system activation after REM sleep deprivation.Associated laboratory findings from polysomnography indicate increased tonic and/or\nphasic electromyographic activity during REM sleep that is normally associated with mus-\ncle atonia. The increased muscle activity variably affects different muscle groups, mandating\nmore extensive electromyographic monitoring than is employed in conventional sleep stud-\nies. For this reason, it is suggested that electromyographic monitoring include the submen-\ntalis, bilateral extensor digitorum, and bilateral anterior tibialis muscle groups. Continuous\nvideo monitoring is mandatory. Other polysomnographic findings may include very fre-\nquent periodic and aperiodic extremity electromyography activity during non-REM\n(NREM) sleep. This polysomnography observation, termed REM sleep without atonia, is pres-\nent in virtually all cases of REM sleep behavior disorder but may also be an asymptomatic\npolysomnographic finding. Clinical dream-enacting behaviors coupled with the polysom-\nnographic finding of REM without atonia is necessary for the diagnosis of REM sleep behav-\nior disorder. REM sleep without atonia without a clinical history of dream-enacting\nbehaviors is simply an asymptomatic polysomnographic observation. It is not known\nwhether isolated REM sleep without atonia is a precursor to REM sleep behavior disorder.Polysomnography demonstrates significant abnormalities in RLS, commonly increased\nlatency to sleep, and higher arousal index. Polysomnography with a preceding immobili-\nzation test may provide an indicator of the motor sign of RLS, periodic limb movements,\nunder standard conditions of sleep and during quiet resting, both of which can provoke RLS\nsymptoms.Each of the substance/medication-induced sleep disorders produces electroencephalo-\ngraphic sleep patterns that are associated with, but cannot be considered diagnostic of, other\ndisorders. The electroencephalographic sleep profile for each substance is related to the\nstage of use, whether intake/intoxication, chronic use, or withdrawal following discontinu-\nation of the substance. All-night polysomnography can help define the severity of insomnia\ncomplaints, while the multiple sleep latency test provides information about the severity of\ndaytime sleepiness. Monitoring of nocturnal respiration and periodic limb movements with\npolysomnography may verify a substance’s impact on nocturnal breathing and motor be-\nhavior. Sleep diaries for 2 weeks and actigraphy are considered helpful in confirming the\npresence of substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. Drug screening can be of use\nwhen the individual is not aware or unwilling to relate information about substance intake.Nocturnal penile tumescence testing and measured erectile turgidity during sleep can be\nemployed to help differentiate organic from psychogenic erectile problems on the as-\nsumption that adequate erections during rapid eye movement sleep indicate a psycholog-\nical etiology to the problem. A number of other diagnostic procedures may be employed\ndepending on the clinician’s assessment of their relevance given the individual’s age, co-\nmorbid medical problems, and clinical presentation. Doppler ultrasonography and intra-\nvascular injection of vasoactive drugs, as well as invasive diagnostic procedures such as\ndynamic infusion cavernosography, can be used to assess vascular integrity. Pudendal\nnerve conduction studies, including somatosensory evoked potentials, can be employed\nwhen a peripheral neuropathy is suspected. In men also complaining of decreased sexual\ndesire, serum bioavailable or free testosterone is frequently assessed to determine if the\ndifficulty is secondary to endocrinological factors. Thyroid function may also be assessed.\nDetermination of fasting serum glucose is useful to screen for the presence of diabetes mel-\nlitus. The assessment of serum lipids is important, as erectile disorder in men 40 years and\nolder is predictive of the future risk of coronary artery disease.Although measurable physiological changes occur during female orgasm, including\nchanges in hormones, pelvic floor musculature, and brain activation, there is significant\nvariability in these indicators of orgasm across women. In clinical situations, the diagnosis\nof female orgasmic disorder is based on a woman’s self-report.Ejaculatory latency is usually monitored in research settings by the sexual partner utilizing\na timing device (e.g., stopwatch), though this is not ideal in real-life sexual situations. For\nvaginal intercourse, the time between intravaginal penetration and ejaculation is measured.Individuals with a somatic disorder of sex development show some correlation of final\ngender identity outcome with the degree of prenatal androgen production and utilization.\nHowever, the correlation is not robust enough for the biological factor, where ascertain-\nable, to replace a detailed and comprehensive diagnostic interview evaluation for gender\ndysphoria.", "suicide_risk": "Approximately 5%–6% of individuals with schizophrenia die by suicide, about 20% attempt\nsuicide on one or more occasions, and many more have significant suicidal ideation. Suicidal\nbehavior is sometimes in response to command hallucinations to harm oneself or others.especially high for younger males with comorbid substance use. Other risk factors include\nhaving depressive symptoms or feelings of hopelessness and being unemployed, and the\nrisk is higher, also, in the period after a psychotic episode or hospital discharge.The lifetime risk of suicide for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder is 5%, and the\npresence of depressive symptoms is correlated with a higher risk for suicide. There is ev-\nidence that suicide rates are higher in North American populations than in European,\nEastern European, South American, and Indian populations of individuals with schizo-\nphrenia or schizoaffective disorder.clearly delineated, although certain conditions such as epilepsy and multiple sclerosis are\nassociated with increased rates of suicide, which may be further increased in the presence\nof psychosis.The lifetime risk of suicide in individuals with bipolar disorder is estimated to be at least\n15 times that of the general population. In fact, bipolar disorder may account for one-quar-\nter of all completed suicides. A past history of suicide attempt and percent days spent de-\npressed in the past year are associated with greater risk of suicide attempts or completions.polar II disorder report a lifetime history of suicide attempt. The prevalence rates of life-\ntime attempted suicide in bipolar II and bipolar I disorder appear to be similar (32.4% and\n36.3%, respectively). However, the lethality of attempts, as defined by a lower ratio of at-\ntempts to completed suicides, may be higher in individuals with bipolar II disorder com-\npared with individuals with bipolar I disorder. There may be an association between\ngenetic markers and increased risk for suicidal behavior in individuals with bipolar dis-\norder, including a 6.5-fold higher risk of suicide among first-degree relatives of bipolar II\nprobands compared with those with bipolar I disorder.In general, evidence documenting suicidal behavior and aggression, as well as other se-\nvere functional consequences, in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be noted\nwhen evaluating children with chronic irritability.The evaluation of the symptoms of a major depressive episode is especially difficult\nwhen they occur in an individual who also has a general medical condition (e.g., cancer,\nstroke, myocardial infarction, diabetes, pregnancy). Some of the criterion signs and symp-\ntoms of a major depressive episode are identical to those of general medical conditions\n(e.g., weight loss with untreated diabetes; fatigue with cancer; hypersomnia early in preg-\nnancy; insomnia later in pregnancy or the postpartum). Such symptoms count toward a\nmajor depressive diagnosis except when they are clearly and fully attributable to a general\nmedical condition. Nonvegetative symptoms of dysphoria, anhedonia, guilt or worthless-\nness, impaired concentration or indecision, and suicidal thoughts should be assessed with\nparticular care in such cases. Definitions of major depressive episodes that have been mod-\nified to include only these nonvegetative symptoms appear to identify nearly the same in-\ndividuals as do the full criteria.The possibility of suicidal behavior exists at all times during major depressive episodes.\nThe most consistently described risk factor is a past history of suicide attempts or threats,\nbut it should be remembered that most completed suicides are not preceded by unsuccess-\nful attempts. Other features associated with an increased risk for completed suicide\ninclude male sex, being single or living alone, and having prominent feelings of hopeless-\nness. The presence of borderline personality disorder markedly increases risk for future\nsuicide attempts.Drug-induced or treatment-emergent suicidality represents a marked change in thoughts\nand behavior from the person’s baseline, is usually temporally associated with initiation of\na substance, and must be distinguished from the underlying primary mental disorders.\nIn regard to the treatment-emergent suicidality associated with antidepressants, a U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee considered meta-analyses of\n99,839 participants enrolled in 372 randomized clinical trials of antidepressants in trials for\nmental disorders. The analyses showed that when the data were pooled across all adult\nage groups, there was no perceptible increased risk of suicidal behavior or ideation. How-\never, in age-stratified analyses, the risk for patients ages 18–24 years was elevated, albeit\nnot significantly (odds ratio [OR] = 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.91–2.70). The\nFDA meta-analyses reveal an absolute risk of suicide in patients taking investigational an-\ntidepressants of 0.01%. In conclusion, suicide is clearly an extremely rare treatment-emer-\ngent phenomenon, but the outcome of suicide was serious enough to prompt the FDA to\nissue an expanded black-box warning in 2007 regarding the importance of careful moni-\ntoring of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation in patients receiving antidepressants.There are no epidemiological studies that provide evidence to differentiate the risk of sui-\ncide from a major depressive episode due to another medical condition compared with the\nrisk from a major depressive episode in general. There are case reports of suicides in\nassociation with major depressive episodes associated with another medical condition.\nThere is a clear association between serious medical illnesses and suicide, particularly\nshortly after onset or diagnosis of the illness. Thus, it would be prudent to assume that the\nrisk of suicide for major depressive episodes associated with medical conditions is not less\nthan that for other forms of major depressive episode, and might even be greater.Separation anxiety disorder in children may be associated with an increased risk for sui-\ncide. In a community sample, the presence of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, or sub-\nstance use has been associated with suicidal ideation and attempts. However, this\nassociation is not specific to separation anxiety disorder and is found in several anxiety\ndisorders.Individuals with specific phobia are up to 60% more likely to make a suicide attempt than\nare individuals without the diagnosis. However, it is likely that these elevated rates are\nprimarily due to comorbidity with personality disorders and other anxiety disorders.Panic attacks and a diagnosis of panic disorder in the past 12 months are related to a higher\nrate of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation in the past 12 months even when comorbid-\nity and a history of childhood abuse and other suicide risk factors are taken into account.Suicidal thoughts occur at some point in as many as about half of individuals with OCD.\nSuicide attempts are also reported in up to one-quarter of individuals with OCD; the pres-\nence of comorbid major depressive disorder increases the risk.Rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are high in both adults and children/ado-\nlescents with body dysmorphic disorder. Furthermore, risk for suicide appears high in ad-\nolescents. A substantial proportion of individuals attribute suicidal ideation or suicide\nattempts primarily to their appearance concerns. Individuals with body dysmorphic dis-\norder have many risk factors for completed suicide, such as high rates of suicidal ideation\nand suicide attempts, demographic characteristics associated with suicide, and high rates\nof comorbid major depressive disorder.Traumatic events such as childhood abuse increase a person’s suicide risk. PTSD is associated\nwith suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, and presence of the disorder may indicate which\nindividuals with ideation eventually make a suicide plan or actually attempt suicide.Over 70% of outpatients with dissociative identity disorder have attempted suicide; mul-\ntiple attempts are common, and other self-injurious behavior is frequent. Assessment ofthe presenting identity does not feel suicidal and is unaware that other dissociated iden-\ntities do.Suicidal and other self-destructive behaviors are common in individuals with dissociative\namnesia. Suicidal behavior may be a particular risk when the amnesia remits suddenly\nand overwhelms the individual with intolerable memories.Comprehensive evaluation of individuals with anorexia nervosa should include assess-\nment of suicide-related ideation and behaviors as well as other risk factors for suicide, in-\ncluding a history of suicide attempt(s).this disorder should include assessment of suicide-related ideation and behaviors as well\nas other risk factors for suicide, including a history of suicide attempts.", "functional_consequences": "Specific Learning Disorder\nSpecific learning disorder can have negative functional consequences across the lifespan,\nincluding lower academic attainment, higher rates of high school dropout, lower rates of\npostsecondary education, high levels of psychological distress and poorer overall mental\nhealth, higher rates of unemployment and under-employment, and lower incomes. School\ndropout and co-occurring depressive symptoms increase the risk for poor mental health\noutcomes, including suicidality, whereas high levels of social or emotional support predict\nbetter mental health outcomes.Developmental Coordination Disorder\nDevelopmental coordination disorder leads to impaired functional performance in activ-\nities of daily living (Criterion B), and the impairment is increased with co-occurring con-\nditions. Consequences of developmental coordination disorder include reduced\nparticipation in team play and sports; poor self-esteem and sense of self-worth; emotional\nor behavior problems; impaired academic achievement; poor physical fitness; and re-\nduced physical activity and obesity.Many individuals with mild to moderate tic severity experience no distress or impairment\nin functioning and may even be unaware of their tics. Individuals with more severe symp-\ntoms generally have more impairment in daily living, but even individuals with moderate\nor even severe tic disorders may function well. The presence of a co-occurring condition,\nsuch as ADHD or OCD, can have greater impact on functioning. Less commonly, tics dis-\nrupt functioning in daily activities and result in social isolation, interpersonal conflict,\npeer victimization, inability to work or to go to school, and lower quality of life. The indi-\nvidual also may experience substantial psychological distress. Rare complications of Tou-\nrette’s disorder include physical injury, such as eye injury (from hitting oneself in the face),\nand orthopedic and neurological injury (e.g., disc disease related to forceful head and neck\nmovements).The functional impairment is usually more circumscribed than that seen with other psy-\nchotic disorders, although in some cases, the impairment may be substantial and include\npoor occupational functioning and social isolation. When poor psychosocial functioning is\npresent, delusional beliefs themselves often play a significant role. A common character-\nistic of individuals with delusional disorder is the apparent normality of their behavior\nand appearance when their delusional ideas are not being discussed or acted on.Despite high rates of relapse, for most individuals, outcome is excellent in terms of social\nfunctioning and symptomatology.\n96\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic DisordersSchizophreniform Disorder\nFor the majority of individuals with schizophreniform disorder who eventually receive a\ndiagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the functional consequences are\nsimilar to the consequences of those disorders. Most individuals experience dysfunction in\nseveral areas of daily functioning, such as school or work, interpersonal relationships, and\nself-care. Individuals who recover from schizophreniform disorder have better functional\noutcomes.Schizophrenia is associated with significant social and occupational dysfunction. Making\neducational progress and maintaining employment are frequently impaired by avolition\nor other disorder manifestations, even when the cognitive skills are sufficient for the tasks\nat hand. Most individuals are employed at a lower level than their parents, and most, par-\nticularly men, do not marry or have limited social contacts outside of their family.Schizoaffective disorder is associated with social and occupational dysfunction, but dys-\nfunction is not a diagnostic criterion (as it is for schizophrenia), and there is substantial\nvariability between individuals diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder.Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder\nSubstance/medication-induced psychotic disorder is typically severely disabling and\nconsequently is observed most frequently in emergency rooms, as individuals are often\nbrought to the acute-care setting when it occurs. However, the disability is typically self-\nlimited and resolves upon removal of the offending agent.Due to Another Medical Condition\nFunctional disability is typically severe in the context of psychotic disorder due to another\nmedical condition but will vary considerably by the type of condition and likely improve\nwith successful resolution of the condition.Although many individuals with bipolar disorder return to a fully functional level be-\ntween episodes, approximately 30% show severe impairment in work role function. Func-\ntional recovery lags substantially behind recovery from symptoms, especially with respect\nto occupational recovery, resulting in lower socioeconomic status despite equivalent lev-\nels of education when compared with the general population. Individuals with bipolar I\ndisorder perform more poorly than healthy individuals on cognitive tests. Cognitive im-\npairments may contribute to vocational and interpersonal difficulties and persist through\nthe lifespan, even during euthymic periods.Although many individuals with bipolar II disorder return to a fully functional level be-\ntween mood episodes, at least 15% continue to have some inter-episode dysfunction, and\n20% transition directly into another mood episode without inter-episode recovery. Func-\ntional recovery lags substantially behind recovery from symptoms of bipolar II disorder,\nespecially in regard to occupational recovery, resulting in lower socioeconomic status de-\nspite equivalent levels of education with the general population. Individuals with bipolar\nII disorder perform more poorly than healthy individuals on cognitive tests and, with the\nexception of memory and semantic fluency, have similar cognitive impairment as do in-\ndividuals with bipolar I disorder. Cognitive impairments associated with bipolar II disor-\nder may contribute to vocational difficulties. Prolonged unemployment in individuals\nwith bipolar disorder is associated with more episodes of depression, older age, increased\nrates of current panic disorder, and lifetime history of alcohol use disorder.Disorder Due to Another Medical Conditionated with the medical condition and may incur worse outcomes due to interference with\nmedical treatment. In general, it is believed, but not established, that the illness, when in-\nduced by Cushing’s disease, will not recur if the Cushing’s disease is cured or arrested.\nHowever, it is also suggested, but not established, that mood syndromes, including de-\npressive and manic/hypomanic ones, may be episodic (i.e., recurring) with static brain in-\njuries and other central nervous system diseases.Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder\nChronic, severe irritability, such as is seen in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, is\nassociated with marked disruption in a child’s family and peer relationships, as well as in\nschool performance. Because of their extremely low frustration tolerance, such children\ngenerally have difficulty succeeding in school; they are often unable to participate in the\nactivities typically enjoyed by healthy children; their family life is severely disrupted by\ntheir outbursts and irritability; and they have trouble initiating or sustaining friendships.\nLevels of dysfunction in children with bipolar disorder and disruptive mood dysregulation\ndisorder are generally comparable. Both conditions cause severe disruption in the lives of\nthe affected individual and their families. In both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder\nand pediatric bipolar disorder, dangerous behavior, suicidal ideation or suicide attempts,\nsevere aggression, and psychiatric hospitalization are common.Major Depressive Disorder\nMany of the functional consequences of major depressive disorder derive from individual\nsymptoms. Impairment can be very mild, such that many of those who interact with the af-\nfected individual are unaware of depressive symptoms. Impairment may, however, range\nto complete incapacity such that the depressed individual is unable to attend to basic self-\ncare needs or is mute or catatonic. Among individuals seen in general medical settings,\nthose with major depressive disorder have more pain and physical illness and greater de-\ncreases in physical, social, and role functioning.Persistent Depressive Disorder\nThe degree to which persistent depressive disorder impacts social and occupational func-\ntioning is likely to vary widely, but effects can be as great as or greater than those of major\ndepressive disorder.Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder\nSymptoms must be associated with clinically meaningful distress and/or an obvious and\nmarked impairment in the ability to function socially or occupationally in the week prior\nto menses. Impairment in social functioning may be manifested by marital discord and\nproblems with children, other family members, or friends. Chronic marital or job prob-\nlems should not be confused with dysfunction that occurs only in association with pre-\nmenstrual dysphoric disorder.Due to Another Medical Conditioneral, it is believed, but not established, that a major depressive episode induced by Cush-\ning’s disease will not recur if the Cushing’s disease is cured or arrested. However, it is also\nsuggested, but not established, that mood syndromes, including depressive and manic/\nhypomanic ones, may be episodic (i.e., recurring) in some individuals with static brain in-\njuries and other central nervous system diseases.Individuals with separation anxiety disorder often limit independent activities away from\nhome or attachment figures (e.g., in children, avoiding school, not going to camp, having\n194\nAnxiety Disorders\ndifficulty sleeping alone; in adolescents, not going away to college; in adults, not leaving the\nparental home, not traveling, not working outside the home).Selective mutism may result in social impairment, as children may be too anxious to en-\ngage in reciprocal social interaction with other children. As children with selective mutism\nmature, they may face increasing social isolation. In school settings, these children may\nsuffer academic impairment, because often they do not communicate with teachers re-\ngarding their academic or personal needs (e.g., not understanding a class assignment, not\nSpecific Phobia\n197\nasking to use the restroom). Severe impairment in school and social functioning, including\nthat resulting from teasing by peers, is common. In certain instances, selective mutism\nmay serve as a compensatory strategy to decrease anxious arousal in social encounters.Individuals with specific phobia show similar patterns of impairment in psychosocial\nfunctioning and decreased quality of life as individuals with other anxiety disorders and\nalcohol and substance use disorders, including impairments in occupational and inter-\npersonal functioning. In older adults, impairment may be seen in caregiving duties and\nvolunteer activities. Also, fear of falling in older adults can lead to reduced mobility and\nreduced physical and social functioning, and may lead to receiving formal or informal\nhome support. The distress and impairment caused by specific phobias tend to increase\nwith the number of feared objects and situations. Thus, an individual who fears four ob-\njects or situations is likely to have more impairment in his or her occupational and social\nroles and a lower quality of life than an individual who fears only one object or situation.\nIndividuals with blood-injection-injury specific phobia are often reluctant to obtain med-\nical care even when a medical concern is present. Additionally, fear of vomiting and chok-\ning may substantially reduce dietary intake.Social anxiety disorder is associated with elevated rates of school dropout and with de-\ncreased well-being, employment, workplace productivity, socioeconomic status, and quality\nof life. Social anxiety disorder is also associated with being single, unmarried, or divorced\nand with not having children, particularly among men. In older adults, there may be impair-\nment in caregiving duties and volunteer activities. Social anxiety disorder also impedes lei-\nsure activities. Despite the extent of distress and social impairment associated with social\nanxiety disorder, only about half of individuals with the disorder in Western societies ever\nseek treatment, and they tend to do so only after 15–20 years of experiencing symptoms. Not\nbeing employed is a strong predictor for the persistence of social anxiety disorder.Panic disorder is associated with high levels of social, occupational, and physical disabil-\nity; considerable economic costs; and the highest number of medical visits among the anx-\niety disorders, although the effects are strongest with the presence of agoraphobia.\nIndividuals with panic disorder may be frequently absent from work or school for doctor\nand emergency room visits, which can lead to unemployment or dropping out of school.\nIn older adults, impairment may be seen in caregiving duties or volunteer activities. Full-\nsymptom panic attacks typically are associated with greater morbidity (e.g., greater health\ncare utilization, more disability, poorer quality of life) than limited-symptom attacks.In the context of co-occurring mental disorders, including anxiety disorders, depressive\ndisorders, bipolar disorder, substance use disorders, psychotic disorders, and personality\ndisorders, panic attacks are associated with increased symptom severity, higher rates ofAgoraphobia is associated with considerable impairment and disability in terms of role\nfunctioning, work productivity, and disability days. Agoraphobia severity is a strong de-\nterminant of the degree of disability, irrespective of the presence of comorbid panic disor-\nder, panic attacks, and other comorbid conditions. More than one-third of individuals\nwith agoraphobia are completely homebound and unable to work.Generalized Anxiety Disorder\nExcessive worrying impairs the individual’s capacity to do things quickly and efficiently,\nwhether at home or at work. The worrying takes time and energy; the associated symp-\ntoms of muscle tension and feeling keyed up or on edge, tiredness, difficulty concentrat-\ning, and disturbed sleep contribute to the impairment. Importantly the excessive worrying\nmay impair the ability of individuals with generalized anxiety disorder to encourage con-\nfidence in their children.\nGeneralized anxiety disorder is associated with significant disability and distress that is\nindependent of comorbid disorders, and most non-institutionalized adults with the disorder\nare moderately to seriously disabled. Generalized anxiety disorder accounts for 110 mil-\nlion disability days per annum in the U.S. population.Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\nOCD is associated with reduced quality of life as well as high levels of social and occupa-\ntional impairment. Impairment occurs across many different domains of life and is asso-\nciated with symptom severity. Impairment can be caused by the time spent obsessing and\ndoing compulsions. Avoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions or compulsions\ncan also severely restrict functioning. In addition, specific symptoms can create specific\nobstacles. For example, obsessions about harm can make relationships with family and\nfriends feel hazardous; the result can be avoidance of these relationships. Obsessions\nabout symmetry can derail the timely completion of school or work projects because the\nproject never feels “just right,” potentially resulting in school failure or job loss. Health\nconsequences can also occur. For example, individuals with contamination concerns may\navoid doctors’ offices and hospitals (e.g., because of fears of exposure to germs) or develop\ndermatological problems (e.g., skin lesions due to excessive washing). Sometimes the\nsymptoms of the disorder interfere with its own treatment (e.g., when medications are con-\nsidered contaminated). When the disorder starts in childhood or adolescence, individuals\nmay experience developmental difficulties. For example, adolescents may avoid socializ-\ning with peers; young adults may struggle when they leave home to live independently.\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder\n241\nThe result can be few significant relationships outside the family and a lack of autonomy\nand financial independence from their family of origin. In addition, some individuals with\nOCD try to impose rules and prohibitions on family members because of their disorder\n(e.g., no one in the family can have visitors to the house for fear of contamination), and this\ncan lead to family dysfunction.Body Dysmorphic Disorder\nNearly all individuals with body dysmorphic disorder experience impaired psychosocial\nfunctioning because of their appearance concerns. Impairment can range from moderate\n(e.g., avoidance of some social situations) to extreme and incapacitating (e.g., being com-\npletely housebound). On average, psychosocial functioning and quality of life are mark-\nedly poor. More severe body dysmorphic disorder symptoms are associated with poorer\nfunctioning and quality of life. Most individuals experience impairment in their job, aca-\ndemic, or role functioning (e.g., as a parent or caregiver), which is often severe (e.g., per-\nforming poorly, missing school or work, not working). About 20% of youths with body\ndysmorphic disorder report dropping out of school primarily because of their body dys-\nmorphic disorder symptoms. Impairment in social functioning (e.g., social activities, rela-\ntionships, intimacy), including avoidance, is common. Individuals may be housebound\nbecause of their body dysmorphic disorder symptoms, sometimes for years. A high pro-\nportion of adults and adolescents have been psychiatrically hospitalized.Clutter impairs basic activities, such as moving through the house, cooking, cleaning, per-\nsonal hygiene, and even sleeping. Appliances may be broken, and utilities such as water\nand electricity may be disconnected, as access for repair work may be difficult. Quality of\nlife is often considerably impaired. In severe cases, hoarding can put individuals at risk for\nfire, falling (especially elderly individuals), poor sanitation, and other health risks. Hoard-\ning disorder is associated with occupational impairment, poor physical health, and high\nsocial service utilization. Family relationships are frequently under great strain. Conflict\nwith neighbors and local authorities is common, and a substantial proportion of individ-\nuals with severe hoarding disorder have been involved in legal eviction proceedings, and\nsome have a history of eviction.Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)\nTrichotillomania is associated with distress as well as with social and occupational impair-\nment. There may be irreversible damage to hair growth and hair quality. Infrequent med-\nical consequences of trichotillomania include digit purpura, musculoskeletal injury (e.g.,\ncarpal tunnel syndrome; back, shoulder and neck pain), blepharitis, and dental damage\n(e.g., worn or broken teeth due to hair biting). Swallowing of hair (trichophagia) may lead\nto trichobezoars, with subsequent anemia, abdominal pain, hematemesis, nausea and\nvomiting, bowel obstruction, and even perforation.Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder\nExcoriation disorder is associated with distress as well as with social and occupational im-\npairment. The majority of individuals with this condition spend at least 1 hour per day\npicking, thinking about picking, and resisting urges to pick. Many individuals report\navoiding social or entertainment events as well as going out in public. A majority of indi-\nviduals with the disorder also report experiencing work interference from skin picking on\nat least a daily or weekly basis. A significant proportion of students with excoriation disor-\nder report having missed school, having experienced difficulties managing responsibilities\nat school, or having had difficulties studying because of skin picking. Medical complica-\ntions of skin picking include tissue damage, scarring, and infection and can be life-threaten-\ning. Rarely, synovitis of the wrists due to chronic picking has been reported. Skin picking\noften results in significant tissue damage and scarring. It frequently requires antibiotic treat-\nment for infection, and on occasion it may require surgery.Reactive Attachment Disorder\nReactive attachment disorder significantly impairs young children’s abilities to relate in-\nterpersonally to adults or peers and is associated with functional impairment across many\ndomains of early childhood.Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder\nDisinhibited social engagement disorder significantly impairs young children’s abilities to\nrelate interpersonally to adults and peers.Posttraumatic Stress Disorder\nPTSD is associated with high levels of social, occupational, and physical disability, as well\nas considerable economic costs and high levels of medical utilization. Impaired function-\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder\n279\ning is exhibited across social, interpersonal, developmental, educational, physical health,\nand occupational domains. In community and veteran samples, PTSD is associated with\npoor social and family relationships, absenteeism from work, lower income, and lower ed-\nucational and occupational success.Impaired functioning in social, interpersonal, or occupational domains has been shown\nacross survivors of accidents, assault, and rape who develop acute stress disorder. The ex-\ntreme levels of anxiety that may be associated with acute stress disorder may interfere\nwith sleep, energy levels, and capacity to attend to tasks. Avoidance in acute stress dis-\norder can result in generalized withdrawal from many situations that are perceived as\npotentially threatening, which can lead to nonattendance of medical appointments, avoid-\nance of driving to important appointments, and absenteeism from work.The subjective distress or impairment in functioning associated with adjustment disorders\nis frequently manifested as decreased performance at work or school and temporary\nchanges in social relationships. An adjustment disorder may complicate the course of ill-\nness in individuals who have a general medical condition (e.g., decreased compliance with\nthe recommended medical regimen; increased length of hospital stay).Dissociative Identity Disorder\nImpairment varies widely, from apparently minimal (e.g., in high-functioning profession-\nals) to profound. Regardless of level of disability, individuals with dissociative identity\ndisorder commonly minimize the impact of their dissociative and posttraumatic symp-\ntoms. The symptoms of higher-functioning individuals may impair their relational, mar-\nital, family, and parenting functions more than their occupational and professional life\n(although the latter also may be affected). With appropriate treatment, many impaired in-\ndividuals show marked improvement in occupational and personal functioning. How-\never, some remain highly impaired in most activities of living. These individuals may only\nrespond to treatment very slowly, with gradual reduction in or improved tolerance of\n296\nDissociative Disorders\ntheir dissociative and posttraumatic symptoms. Long-term supportive treatment may\nslowly increase these individuals’ ability to manage their symptoms and decrease use of\nmore restrictive levels of care.The impairment of individuals with localized, selective, or systematized dissociative am-\nnesia ranges from limited to severe. Individuals with chronic generalized dissociative am-\nnesia usually have impairment in all aspects of functioning. Even when these individuals\n“re-learn” aspects of their life history, autobiographical memory remains very impaired.\nMost become vocationally and interpersonally disabled.Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder\nSymptoms of depersonalization/derealization disorder are highly distressing and are as-\nsociated with major morbidity. The affectively flattened and robotic demeanor that these\nDepersonalization/Derealization Disorder\n305\nindividuals often demonstrate may appear incongruent with the extreme emotional pain\nreported by those with the disorder. Impairment is often experienced in both interpersonal\nand occupational spheres, largely due to the hypoemotionality with others, subjective diffi-\nculty in focusing and retaining information, and a general sense of disconnectedness from\nlife.The disorder is associated with marked impairment of health status. Many individuals\nwith severe somatic symptom disorder are likely to have impaired health status scores\nmore than 2 standard deviations below population norms.\n314\nSomatic Symptom and Related DisordersIllness anxiety disorder causes substantial role impairment and decrements in physical\nfunction and health-related quality of life. Health concerns often interfere with interper-\nsonal relationships, disrupt family life, and damage occupational performance.Individuals with conversion symptoms may have substantial disability. The severity of dis-\nability can be similar to that experienced by individuals with comparable medical diseases.Affecting Other Medical Conditions\nPsychological and behavioral factors have been demonstrated to affect the course of many\nmedical diseases.Pica can significantly impair physical functioning, but it is rarely the sole cause of impair-\nment in social functioning. Pica often occurs with other disorders associated with im-\npaired social functioning.Malnutrition secondary to repeated regurgitation may be associated with growth delay\nand have a negative effect on development and learning potential. Some older individuals\nwith rumination disorder deliberately restrict their food intake because of the social un-\ndesirability of regurgitation. They may therefore present with weight loss or low weight.\nIn older children, adolescents, and adults, social functioning is more likely to be adversely\naffected.Food Intake Disorder\nAssociated developmental and functional limitations include impairment of physical de-\nvelopment and social difficulties that can have a significant negative impact on family\nfunction.Individuals with anorexia nervosa may exhibit a range of functional limitations associated\nwith the disorder. While some individuals remain active in social and professional func-\ntioning, others demonstrate significant social isolation and/or failure to fulfill academic or\ncareer potential.\n344\nFeeding and Eating DisordersIndividuals with bulimia nervosa may exhibit a range of functional limitations associated\nwith the disorder. A minority of individuals report severe role impairment, with the so-\ncial-life domain most likely to be adversely affected by bulimia nervosa.Binge-eating disorder is associated with a range of functional consequences, including so-\ncial role adjustment problems, impaired health-related quality of life and life satisfaction,\nincreased medical morbidity and mortality, and associated increased health care utiliza-\ntion compared with body mass index (BMI)–matched control subjects. It may also be as-\nsociated with an increased risk for weight gain and the development of obesity.The amount of impairment associated with enuresis is a function of the limitation on the\nchild’s social activities (e.g., ineligibility for sleep-away camp) or its effect on the child’s\nself-esteem, the degree of social ostracism by peers, and the anger, punishment, and rejec-\ntion on the part of caregivers.Interpersonal, social, and occupational problems may develop as a result of insomnia or\nexcessive concern with sleep, increased daytime irritability, and poor concentration. De-\ncreased attention and concentration are common and may be related to higher rates of ac-\ncidents observed in insomnia. Persistent insomnia is also associated with long-term\nconsequences, including increased risks of major depressive disorder, hypertension, and\nmyocardial infarction; increased absenteeism and reduced productivity at work; reduced\nquality of life; and increased economic burden.The low level of alertness that occurs while an individual fights the need for sleep can lead\nto reduced efficiency, diminished concentration, and poor memory during daytime activ-\nities. Hypersomnolence can lead to significant distress and dysfunction in work and social\nrelationships. Prolonged nocturnal sleep and difficulty awakening can result in difficulty\nin meeting morning obligations, such as arriving at work on time. Unintentional daytime\nsleep episodes can be embarrassing and even dangerous, if, for instance, the individual is\ndriving or operating machinery when the episode occurs.Driving and working are impaired, and individuals with narcolepsy should avoid jobs\nthat place themselves (e.g., working with machinery) or others (e.g., bus driver, pilot) in\ndanger. Once the narcolepsy is controlled with therapy, patients can usually drive, al-\nthough rarely long distances alone. Untreated individuals are also at risk for social isola-\ntion and accidental injury to themselves or others. Social relations may suffer as these\nindividuals strive to avert cataplexy by exerting control over emotions.Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea\nMore than 50% of individuals with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea\nreport symptoms of daytime sleepiness. A twofold increased risk of occupational accidents\nhas been reported in association with symptoms of snoring and sleepiness. Motor vehicle\ncrashes also have been reported to be as much as sevenfold higher among individuals with\nelevated apnea hypopnea index values. Clinicians should be cognizant of state govern-\nment requirements for reporting this disorder, especially in relationship to commercial\ndrivers. Reduced scores on measures of health-related quality of life are common in individ-\nuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, with the largest decrements observed in the\nphysical and vitality subscales.Idiopathic central sleep apnea has been reported to cause symptoms of disrupted sleep, in-\ncluding insomnia and sleepiness. Cheyne-Stokes breathing with comorbid heart failure\nhas been associated with excessive sleepiness, fatigue, and insomnia, although many in-\ndividuals may be asymptomatic. Coexistence of heart failure and Cheyne-Stokes breath-\ning may be associated with increased cardiac arrhythmias and increased mortality or\ncardiac transplantation. Individuals with central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use\nmay present with symptoms of sleepiness or insomnia.Sleep-Related Hypoventilation\nThe consequences of sleep-related hypoventilation are related to the effects of chronic ex-\nposure to hypercapnia and hypoxemia. These blood gas derangements cause vasocon-\nstriction of the pulmonary vasculature leading to pulmonary hypertension, which, if\nsevere, can result in right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale). Hypoxemia can lead to dys-\nfunction of organs such as the brain, blood, and heart, leading to outcomes such as cog-\nnitive dysfunction, polycythemia, and cardiac arrhythmias. Hypercapnia can depress\nventilatory drive, leading to progressive respiratory failure.Excessive early day sleepiness is prominent. Extreme and prolonged difficulty awakening\nwith morning confusion (i.e., sleep inertia) is also common. The severity of insomnia and\nexcessive sleepiness symptoms varies substantially among individuals and largely de-\npends on the occupational and social demands on the individual.Excessive sleepiness associated with advanced sleep phase can have a negative effect on\ncognitive performance, social interaction, and safety. Use of wake-promoting agents to\ncombat sleepiness or sedatives for early morning awakening may increase potential for\nsubstance abuse.Irregular Sleep-Wake Type\nLack of a clearly discernible major sleep and wake period in irregular sleep-wake type re-\nsults in insomnia or excessive sleepiness, depending on the time of day. Disruption of the\ncaregiver’s sleep also often occurs and is an important consideration.Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Type\nComplaints of insomnia (sleep onset and sleep maintenance), excessive sleepiness, or both\nare prominent. The unpredictability of sleep and wake times (typically a daily delay drift)\nresults in an inability to attend school or maintain a steady job and may increase potential\nfor social isolation.Individuals with shift work type not only may perform poorly at work but also appear to\nbe at risk for accidents both at work and on the drive home. They may also be at risk for\npoor mental health (e.g., alcohol use disorder, substance use disorder, depression) and\nphysical health (e.g., gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer).\nIndividuals with a history of bipolar disorder are particularly vulnerable to shift work\ntype–related episodes of mania resulting from missed nights of sleep. Shift work type of-\nten results in interpersonal problems.Non-REM Sleep Arousal Disorders\nFor the diagnosis of a NREM sleep arousal disorder to be made, the individual or house-\nhold members must experience clinically significant distress or impairment, although pa-\nrasomnia symptoms may occur occasionally in nonclinical populations and would be\nsubthreshold for the diagnosis. Embarrassment concerning the episodes can impair social\nrelationships. Social isolation or occupational difficulties can result. The determination of a\n“disorder” depends on a number of factors, which may vary on an individual basis and\nwill depend on the frequency of events, potential for violence or injurious behaviors, em-\nbarrassment, or disruption/distress of other household members. Severity determination\nis best made based on the nature or consequence of the behaviors rather than simply on fre-\nquency. Uncommonly, NREM sleep arousal disorders may result in serious injury to the\nindividual or to someone trying to console the individual. Injuries to others are confined to\nthose in close proximity; individuals are not “sought out.” Typically, sleepwalking in both\nchildren and adults is not associated with significant mental disorders. For individuals\nwith sleep-related eating behaviors, unknowingly preparing or eating food during the\nsleep period may create problems such as poor diabetes control, weight gain, injury (cuts\nand burns), or consequences of eating dangerous or toxic inedibles. NREM sleep arousal\ndisorders may rarely result in violent or injurious behaviors with forensic implications.Nightmares cause more significant subjective distress than demonstrable social or occu-\npational impairment. However, if awakenings are frequent or result in sleep avoidance,\nindividuals may experience excessive daytime sleepiness, poor concentration, depression,\nanxiety, or irritability. Frequent childhood nightmares (e.g., several per week), may cause\nsignificant distress to parents and child.Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder\nREM sleep behavior disorder may occur in isolated occasions in otherwise unaffected in-\ndividuals. Embarrassment concerning the episodes can impair social relationships. Indi-\nviduals may avoid situations in which others might become aware of the disturbance,\nvisiting friends overnight, or sleeping with bed partners. Social isolation or occupational\ndifficulties can result. Uncommonly, REM sleep behavior disorder may result in serious\ninjury to the victim or to the bed partner.Forms of RLS severe enough to significantly impair functioning or associated with mental dis-\norders, including depression and anxiety, occur in approximately 2%–3% of the population.\nAlthough the impact of milder symptoms is less well characterized, individuals with\nRLS complain of disruption in at least one activity of daily living, with up to 50% reporting\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder\n413\na negative impact on mood, and 47.6% reporting a lack of energy. The most common conse-\nquences of RLS are sleep disturbance, including reduced sleep time, sleep fragmentation,\nand overall disturbance; depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and post-\ntraumatic stress disorder; and quality-of-life impairments. RLS can result in daytime sleep-\niness or fatigue and is frequently accompanied by significant distress or impairment in\naffective, social, occupational, educational, academic, behavioral, or cognitive functioning.Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder\nWhile there are many functional consequences associated with sleep disorders, the only\nunique consequence for substance/medication-induced sleep disorder is increased risk\nfor relapse. The degree of sleep disturbance during alcohol withdrawal (e.g., REM sleep\nrebound predicts risk of relapse of drinking). Monitoring of sleep quality and daytime\nsleepiness during and after withdrawal may provide clinically meaningful information on\nwhether an individual is at increased risk for relapse.Difficulty with ejaculation may contribute to difficulties in conception. Delayed ejacula-\ntion is often associated with considerable psychological distress in one or both partners.Erectile disorder can interfere with fertility and produce both individual and interpersonal\ndistress. Fear and/or avoidance of sexual encounters may interfere with the ability to de-\nvelop intimate relationships.The functional consequences of female orgasmic disorder are unclear. Although there is a\nstrong association between relationship problems and orgasmic difficulties in women, it is\nunclear whether relationship factors are risk factors for orgasmic difficulties or are conse-\nquences of those difficulties.Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder\nDifficulties in sexual interest/arousal are often associated with decreased relationship sat-\nisfaction.Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder\nFunctional difficulties in genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder are often associated\nwith interference in relationship satisfaction and sometimes with the ability to conceive\nvia penile/vaginal intercourse.\n440\nSexual DysfunctionsPremature (Early) Ejaculation\nA pattern of premature (early) ejaculation may be associated with decreased self-esteem, a\nsense of lack of control, and adverse consequences for partner relationships. It may also\ncause personal distress in the sexual partner and decreased sexual satisfaction in the sexual\npartner. Ejaculation prior to penetration may be associated with difficulties in conception.Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction\nMedication-induced sexual dysfunction may result in medication noncompliance.Preoccupation with cross-gender wishes may develop at all ages after the first 2–3 years of\nchildhood and often interfere with daily activities. In older children, failure to develop\nage-typical same-sex peer relationships and skills may lead to isolation from peer groups\nand to distress. Some children may refuse to attend school because of teasing and harass-\n458\nGender Dysphoria\nment or pressure to dress in attire associated with their assigned sex. Also in adolescents\nand adults, preoccupation with cross-gender wishes often interferes with daily activities.\nRelationship difficulties, including sexual relationship problems, are common, and func-\ntioning at school or at work may be impaired. Gender dysphoria, along with atypical\ngender expression, is associated with high levels of stigmatization, discrimination, and\nvictimization, leading to negative self-concept, increased rates of mental disorder comor-\nbidity, school dropout, and economic marginalization, including unemployment, with at-\ntendant social and mental health risks, especially in individuals from resource-poor family\nbackgrounds. In addition, these individuals’ access to health services and mental health\nservices may be impeded by structural barriers, such as institutional discomfort or inex-\nperience in working with this patient population.Oppositional Defiant Disorder\nWhen oppositional defiant disorder is persistent throughout development, individuals\nwith the disorder experience frequent conflicts with parents, teachers, supervisors, peers,\nand romantic partners. Such problems often result in significant impairments in the indi-\nvidual’s emotional, social, academic, and occupational adjustment.Intermittent Explosive Disorder\nSocial (e.g., loss of friends, relatives, marital instability), occupational (e.g., demotion, loss\nof employment), financial (e.g., due to value of objects destroyed), and legal (e.g., civil\nsuits as a result of aggressive behavior against person or property; criminal charges for as-\nsault) problems often develop as a result of intermittent explosive disorder.Conduct disorder behaviors may lead to school suspension or expulsion, problems in\nwork adjustment, legal difficulties, sexually transmitted diseases, unplanned pregnancy,\nand physical injury from accidents or fights. These problems may preclude attendance in\nordinary schools or living in a parental or foster home. Conduct disorder is often associ-\nated with an early onset of sexual behavior, alcohol use, tobacco smoking, use of illegal\nsubstances, and reckless and risk-taking acts. Accident rates appear to be higher among in-\ndividuals with conduct disorder compared with those without the disorder. These func-\ntional consequences of conduct disorder may predict health difficulties when individuals\nreach midlife. It is not uncommon for individuals with conduct disorder to come into con-\ntact with the criminal justice system for engaging in illegal behavior. Conduct disorder is\na common reason for treatment referral and is frequently diagnosed in mental health fa-\ncilities for children, especially in forensic practice. It is associated with impairment that is\nmore severe and chronic than that experienced by other clinic-referred children.The disorder may cause legal, family, career, and personal difficulties.Induced Mental Disorders\nThe same consequences related to the relevant independent mental disorder (e.g., suicide\nattempts) are likely to apply to the substance/medication-induced mental disorders, but\nthese are likely to disappear within 1 month after abstinence. Similarly, the same func-\ntional consequences associated with the relevant substance use disorder are likely to be seen\nfor the substance-induced mental disorders.", "differential_diagnosis": "Oppositional defiant disorder.\nIndividuals with oppositional defiant disorder may re-\nsist work or school tasks that require self-application because they resist conforming to\nothers' demands. Their behavior is characterized by negativity, hostility, and defiance.\nThese symptoms must be differentiated from aversion to school or mentally demanding\ntasks due to difficulty in sustaining mental effort, forgetting instructions, and impulsivity\nin individuals with ADHD. Complicating the differential diagnosis is the fact that some\nindividuals with ADHD may develop secondary oppositional attitudes toward such tasks\nand devalue their importance.\nIntermittent explosive disorder.\nADHD and intermittent explosive disorder share high\nlevels of impulsive behavior. However, individuals with intermittent explosive disorder\nshow serious aggression toward others, which is not characteristic of ADHD, and they do\nnot experience problems with sustaining attention as seen in ADHD. In addition, intermit-\ntent explosive disorder is rare in childhood. Intermittent explosive disorder may be diag-\nnosed in the presence of ADHD.\nOther neurodevelopmental disorders.\nThe increased motoric activity that may occur in\nADHD must be distinguished from the repetitive motor behavior that characterizes stereo-\ntypic movement disorder and some cases of autism spectrum disorder. In stereotypic\nmovement disorder, the motoric behavior is generally fixed and repetitive (e.g., body rock-\ning, self-biting), whereas the fidgetiness and restlessness in ADHD are typically general-\nized and not characterized by repetitive stereotypic movements. In Tourette’s disorder,\n64\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nfrequent multiple tics can be mistaken for the generalized fidgetiness of ADHD. Prolonged\nobservation may be needed to differentiate fidgetiness from bouts of multiple tics.\nSpecific learning disorder.\nChildren with specific learning disorder may appear inat-\ntentive because of frustration, lack of interest, or limited ability. However, inattention in\nindividuals with a specific learning disorder who do not have ADHD is not impairing out-\nside of academic work.\nIntellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).\nSymptoms of ADHD are\ncommon among children placed in academic settings that are inappropriate to their intel-\nlectual ability. In such cases, the symptoms are not evident during non-academic tasks. A\ndiagnosis of ADHD in intellectual disability requires that inattention or hyperactivity be\nexcessive for mental age.\nAutism spectrum disorder.\nIndividuals with ADHD and those with autism spectrum\ndisorder exhibit inattention, social dysfunction, and difficult-to-manage behavior. The so-\ncial dysfunction and peer rejection seen in individuals with ADHD must be distinguished\nfrom the social disengagement, isolation, and indifference to facial and tonal communica-\ntion cues seen in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Children with autism spec-\ntrum disorder may display tantrums because of an inability to tolerate a change from their\nexpected course of events. In contrast, children with ADHD may misbehave or have a tan-\ntrum during a major transition because of impulsivity or poor self-control.\nReactive attachment disorder.\nChildren with reactive attachment disorder may show\nsocial disinhibition, but not the full ADHD symptom cluster, and display other features\nsuch as a lack of enduring relationships that are not characteristic of ADHD.\nAnxiety disorders.\nADHD shares symptoms of inattention with anxiety disorders. Indi-\nviduals with ADHD are inattentive because of their attraction to external stimuli, new\nactivities, or preoccupation with enjoyable activities. This is distinguished from the inat-\ntention due to worry and rumination seen in anxiety disorders. Restlessness might be seen\nin anxiety disorders. However, in ADHD, the symptom is not associated with worry and\nrumination.\nDepressive disorders.\nIndividuals with depressive disorders may present with inabil-\nity to concentrate. However, poor concentration in mood disorders becomes prominent\nonly during a depressive episode.\nBipolar disorder.\nIndividuals with bipolar disorder may have increased activity, poor\nconcentration, and increased impulsivity, but these features are episodic, occurring sev-\neral days at a time. In bipolar disorder, increased impulsivity or inattention is accompa-\nnied by elevated mood, grandiosity, and other specific bipolar features. Children with\nADHD may show significant changes in mood within the same day; such lability is dis-\ntinct from a manic episode, which must last 4 or more days to be a clinical indicator of bi-\npolar disorder, even in children. Bipolar disorder is rare in preadolescents, even when\nsevere irritability and anger are prominent, whereas ADHD is common among children\nand adolescents who display excessive anger and irritability.\nDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder.\nDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder is\ncharacterized by pervasive irritability, and intolerance of frustration, but impulsiveness\nand disorganized attention are not essential features. However, most children and adoles-\ncents with the disorder have symptoms that also meet criteria for ADHD, which is diag-\nnosed separately.\nSubstance use disorders.\nDifferentiating ADHD from substance use disorders may be\nproblematic if the first presentation of ADHD symptoms follows the onset of abuse or fre-\nquent use. Clear evidence of ADHD before substance misuse from informants or previous\nrecords may be essential for differential diagnosis.\nOther Specified Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder\n65\nPersonality disorders.\nIn adolescents and adults, it may be difficult to distinguish ADHD\nfrom borderline, narcissistic, and other personality disorders. All these disorders tend to\nshare the features of disorganization, social intrusiveness, emotional dysregulation, and\ncognitive dysregulation. However, ADHD is not characterized by fear of abandonment,\nself-injury, extreme ambivalence, or other features of personality disorder. It may take\nextended clinical observation, informant interview, or detailed history to distinguish im-\npulsive, socially intrusive, or inappropriate behavior from narcissistic, aggressive, or dom-\nineering behavior to make this differential diagnosis.\nPsychotic disorders.\nADHD is not diagnosed if the symptoms of inattention and hyperac-\ntivity occur exclusively during the course of a psychotic disorder.\nMedication-induced symptoms of ADHD.\nSymptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or\nimpulsivity attributable to the use of medication (e.g., bronchodilators, isoniazid, neuro-\nleptics [resulting in akathisia], thyroid replacement medication) are diagnosed as other\nspecified or unspecified other (or unknown) substance–related disorders.\nNeurocognitive disorders.\nEarly major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) and/or\nmild neurocognitive disorder are not known to be associated with ADHD but may present\nwith similar clinical features. These conditions are distinguished from ADHD by their late\nonset.Normal variations in academic attainment.\nSpecific learning disorder is distinguished\nfrom normal variations in academic attainment due to external factors (e.g., lack of edu-\ncational opportunity, consistently poor instruction, learning in a second language), be-\ncause the learning difficulties persist in the presence of adequate educational opportunity\nand exposure to the same instruction as the peer group, and competency in the language of\ninstruction, even when it is different from one’s primary spoken language.\nIntellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).\nSpecific learning disorder\ndiffers from general learning difficulties associated with intellectual disability, because the\nlearning difficulties occur in the presence of normal levels of intellectual functioning (i.e.,\nIQ score of at least 70 ± 5). If intellectual disability is present, specific learning disorder can\nbe diagnosed only when the learning difficulties are in excess of those usually associated\nwith the intellectual disability.\nLearning difficulties due to neurological or sensory disorders.\nSpecific learning dis-\norder is distinguished from learning difficulties due to neurological or sensory disorders\n(e.g., pediatric stroke, traumatic brain injury, hearing impairment, vision impairment), be-\ncause in these cases there are abnormal findings on neurological examination.\nNeurocognitive disorders.\nSpecific learning disorder is distinguished from learning\nproblems associated with neurodegenerative cognitive disorders, because in specific\nlearning disorder the clinical expression of specific learning difficulties occurs during the\ndevelopmental period, and the difficulties do not manifest as a marked decline from a for-\nmer state.\n74\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nSpecific learning disorder is distinguished from\nthe poor academic performance associated with ADHD, because in the latter condition the\nproblems may not necessarily reflect specific difficulties in learning academic skills but\nrather may reflect difficulties in performing those skills. However, the co-occurrence of\nspecific learning disorder and ADHD is more frequent than expected by chance. If criteria\nfor both disorders are met, both diagnoses can be given.\nPsychotic disorders.\nSpecific learning disorder is distinguished from the academic and\ncognitive-processing difficulties associated with schizophrenia or psychosis, because with\nthese disorders there is a decline (often rapid) in these functional domains.Motor impairments due to another medical condition.\nProblems in coordination may\nbe associated with visual function impairment and specific neurological disorders (e.g.,\ncerebral palsy, progressive lesions of the cerebellum, neuromuscular disorders). In such\ncases, there are additional findings on neurological examination.\nIntellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).\nIf intellectual disability is\npresent, motor competences may be impaired in accordance with the intellectual disabil-\nStereotypic Movement Disorder\n77\nity. However, if the motor difficulties are in excess of what could be accounted for by the\nintellectual disability, and criteria for developmental coordination disorder are met, de-\nvelopmental coordination disorder can be diagnosed as well.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nIndividuals with ADHD may fall, bump into\nobjects, or knock things over. Careful observation across different contexts is required to\nascertain if lack of motor competence is attributable to distractibility and impulsiveness\nrather than to developmental coordination disorder. If criteria for both ADHD and devel-\nopmental coordination disorder are met, both diagnoses can be given.\nAutism spectrum disorder.\nIndividuals with autism spectrum disorder may be uninter-\nested in participating in tasks requiring complex coordination skills, such as ball sports,\nwhich will affect test performance and function but not reflect core motor competence. Co-\noccurrence of developmental coordination disorder and autism spectrum disorder is com-\nmon. If criteria for both disorders are met, both diagnoses can be given.\nJoint hypermobility syndrome.\nIndividuals with syndromes causing hyperextensible\njoints (found on physical examination; often with a complaint of pain) may present with\nsymptoms similar to those of developmental coordination disorder.Normal development.\nSimple stereotypic movements are common in infancy and early\nchildhood. Rocking may occur in the transition from sleep to awake, a behavior that usu-\n80\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nally resolves with age. Complex stereotypies are less common in typically developing\nchildren and can usually be suppressed by distraction or sensory stimulation. The indi-\nvidual’s daily routine is rarely affected, and the movements generally do not cause the\nchild distress. The diagnosis would not be appropriate in these circumstances.\nAutism spectrum disorder.\nStereotypic movements may be a presenting symptom of\nautism spectrum disorder and should be considered when repetitive movements and be-\nhaviors are being evaluated. Deficits of social communication and reciprocity manifesting\nin autism spectrum disorder are generally absent in stereotypic movement disorder, and\nthus social interaction, social communication, and rigid repetitive behaviors and interests\nare distinguishing features. When autism spectrum disorder is present, stereotypic move-\nment disorder is diagnosed only when there is self-injury or when the stereotypic behav-\niors are sufficiently severe to become a focus of treatment.\nTic disorders.\nTypically, stereotypies have an earlier age at onset (before 3 years) than\ndo tics, which have a mean age at onset of 5–7 years. They are consistent and fixed in their\npattern or topography compared with tics, which are variable in their presentation. Ste-\nreotypies may involve arms, hands, or the entire body, while tics commonly involve eyes,\nface, head, and shoulders. Stereotypies are more fixed, rhythmic, and prolonged in dura-\ntion than tics, which, generally, are brief, rapid, random, and fluctuating. Tics and stereo-\ntypic movements are both reduced by distraction.\nObsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nStereotypic movement disorder is dis-\ntinguished from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) by the absence of obsessions, as\nwell as by the nature of the repetitive behaviors. In OCD the individual feels driven to per-\nform repetitive behaviors in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be ap-\nplied rigidly, whereas in stereotypic movement disorder the behaviors are seemingly\ndriven but apparently purposeless. Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) and excoria-\ntion (skin-picking) disorder are characterized by body-focused repetitive behaviors (i.e.,\nhair pulling and skin picking) that may be seemingly driven but that are not apparently\npurposeless, and that may not be patterned or rhythmical. Furthermore, onset in tricho-\ntillomania and excoriation disorder is not typically in the early developmental period, but\nrather around puberty or later.\nOther neurological and medical conditions.\nThe diagnosis of stereotypic movements\nrequires the exclusion of habits, mannerisms, paroxysmal dyskinesias, and benign he-\nreditary chorea. A neurological history and examination are required to assess features\nsuggestive of other disorders, such as myoclonus, dystonia, tics, and chorea. Involuntary\nmovements associated with a neurological condition may be distinguished by their signs\nand symptoms. For example, repetitive, stereotypic movements in tardive dyskinesia can\nbe distinguished by a history of chronic neuroleptic use and characteristic oral or facial\ndyskinesia or irregular trunk or limb movements. These types of movements do not result\nin self-injury. A diagnosis of stereotypic movement disorder is not appropriate for repet-\nitive skin picking or scratching associated with amphetamine intoxication or abuse (e.g.,\npatients are diagnosed with substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and re-\nlated disorder) and repetitive choreoathetoid movements associated with other neurolog-\nical disorders.Abnormal movements that may accompany other medical conditions and stereotypic\nmovement disorder.\nMotor stereotypies are defined as involuntary rhythmic, repetitive,\npredictable movements that appear purposeful but serve no obvious adaptive function or\npurpose and stop with distraction. Examples include repetitive hand waving/rotating,\narm flapping, and finger wiggling. Motor stereotypies can be differentiated from tics based\non the former’s earlier age at onset (younger than 3 years), prolonged duration (seconds to\nminutes), constant repetitive fixed form and location, exacerbation when engrossed in ac-\ntivities, lack of a premonitory urge, and cessation with distraction (e.g., name called or\ntouched). Chorea represents rapid, random, continual, abrupt, irregular, unpredictable,\nnonstereotyped actions that are usually bilateral and affect all parts of the body (i.e., face,\ntrunk, and limbs). The timing, direction, and distribution of movements vary from mo-\nment to moment, and movements usually worsen during attempted voluntary action. Dys-\ntonia is the simultaneous sustained contracture of both agonist and antagonist muscles,\nresulting in a distorted posture or movement of parts of the body. Dystonic postures are of-\nten triggered by attempts at voluntary movements and are not seen during sleep.\nSubstance-induced and paroxysmal dyskinesias.\nParoxysmal dyskinesias usually oc-\ncur as dystonic or choreoathetoid movements that are precipitated by voluntary move-\nment or exertion and less commonly arise from normal background activity.\nMyoclonus.\nMyoclonus is characterized by a sudden unidirectional movement that is\noften nonrhythmic. It may be worsened by movement and occur during sleep. Myoclonus\nis differentiated from tics by its rapidity, lack of suppressibility, and absence of a premon-\nitory urge.\nObsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nDifferentiating obsessive-compulsive\nbehaviors from tics may be difficult. Clues favoring an obsessive-compulsive behavior in-\nclude a cognitive-based drive (e.g., fear of contamination) and the need to perform the ac-\ntion in a particular fashion a certain number of times, equally on both sides of the body, or\nuntil a “just right” feeling is achieved. Impulse-control problems and other repetitive be-\nhaviors, including persistent hair pulling, skin picking, and nail biting, appear more goal\ndirected and complex than tics.\nOther Specified Tic Disorder\n85Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nIf an individual with obsessive-compul-\nsive disorder is completely convinced that his or her obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs\nare true, then the diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder, with absent insight/delu-\nsional beliefs specifier, should be given rather than a diagnosis of delusional disorder.\nSimilarly, if an individual with body dysmorphic disorder is completely convinced that\nhis or her body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true, then the diagnosis of body dysmor-\nphic disorder, with absent insight/delusional beliefs specifier, should be given rather than\na diagnosis of delusional disorder.\nDelirium, major neurocognitive disorder, psychotic disorder due to another medical con-\ndition, and substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder.\nIndividuals with these\ndisorders may present with symptoms that suggest delusional disorder. For example, sim-\nple persecutory delusions in the context of major neurocognitive disorder would be di-\nagnosed as major neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral disturbance. A substance/\nmedication-induced psychotic disorder cross-sectionally may be identical in symptom-\natology to delusional disorder but can be distinguished by the chronological relationship\nof substance use to the onset and remission of the delusional beliefs.\nSchizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder.\nDelusional disorder can be distinguished\nfrom schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder by the absence of the other character-\nistic symptoms of the active phase of schizophrenia.\nDepressive and bipolar disorders and schizoaffective disorder.\nThese disorders may\nbe distinguished from delusional disorder by the temporal relationship between the mood\ndisturbance and the delusions and by the severity of the mood symptoms. If delusions oc-\ncur exclusively during mood episodes, the diagnosis is depressive or bipolar disorder with\npsychotic features. Mood symptoms that meet full criteria for a mood episode can be su-\nperimposed on delusional disorder. Delusional disorder can be diagnosed only if the total\nduration of all mood episodes remains brief relative to the total duration of the delusional\ndisturbance. If not, then a diagnosis of other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spec-\ntrum and other psychotic disorder accompanied by other specified depressive disorder,\nunspecified depressive disorder, other specified bipolar and related disorder, or unspeci-\nfied bipolar and related disorder is appropriate.\n94\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\nBrief Psychotic DisorderOther medical conditions.\nA variety of medical disorders can manifest with psychotic\nsymptoms of short duration. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition or a de-\nlirium is diagnosed when there is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab-\noratory tests that the delusions or hallucinations are the direct physiological consequence\nof a specific medical condition (e.g., Cushing’s syndrome, brain tumor) (see “Psychotic\nDisorder Due to Another Medical Condition” later in this chapter).\nSubstance-related disorders.\nSubstance/medication-induced psychotic disorder, sub-\nstance-induced delirium, and substance intoxication are distinguished from brief psychotic\ndisorder by the fact that a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, exposure to a toxin)\nis judged to be etiologically related to the psychotic symptoms (see “Substance/Medication-\nInduced Psychotic Disorder” later in this chapter). Laboratory tests, such as a urine drug\nscreen or a blood alcohol level, may be helpful in making this determination, as may a care-\nful history of substance use with attention to temporal relationships between substance in-\ntake and onset of the symptoms and to the nature of the substance being used.\nDepressive and bipolar disorders.\nThe diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder cannot be\nmade if the psychotic symptoms are better explained by a mood episode (i.e., the psychotic\nsymptoms occur exclusively during a full major depressive, manic, or mixed episode).\nOther psychotic disorders.\nIf the psychotic symptoms persist for 1 month or longer, the\ndiagnosis is either schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, depressive disorder\nwith psychotic features, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, or other specified or un-\nspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, depending on the other\nsymptoms in the presentation. The differential diagnosis between brief psychotic disorder\nand schizophreniform disorder is difficult when the psychotic symptoms have remitted be-\nfore 1 month in response to successful treatment with medication. Careful attention should\nbe given to the possibility that a recurrent disorder (e.g., bipolar disorder, recurrent acute ex-\nacerbations of schizophrenia) may be responsible for any recurring psychotic episodes.\nMalingering and factitious disorders.\nAn episode of factitious disorder, with predomi-\nnantly psychological signs and symptoms, may have the appearance of brief psychotic\ndisorder, but in such cases there is evidence that the symptoms are intentionally produced.\nWhen malingering involves apparently psychotic symptoms, there is usually evidence\nthat the illness is being feigned for an understandable goal.\nPersonality disorders.\nIn certain individuals with personality disorders, psychosocial\nstressors may precipitate brief periods of psychotic symptoms. These symptoms are usu-\nally transient and do not warrant a separate diagnosis. If psychotic symptoms persist for at\nleast 1 day, an additional diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder may be appropriate.\nSchizophreniform DisorderOther mental disorders and medical conditions.\nA wide variety of mental and medical\nconditions can manifest with psychotic symptoms that must be considered in the differ-\nential diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder. These include psychotic disorder due to\nanother medical condition or its treatment; delirium or major neurocognitive disorder;\nsubstance/medication-induced psychotic disorder or delirium; depressive or bipolar\ndisorder with psychotic features; schizoaffective disorder; other specified or unspecified bi-\npolar and related disorder; depressive or bipolar disorder with catatonic features; schizophre-\nSchizophrenia\n99\nnia; brief psychotic disorder; delusional disorder; other specified or unspecified schizo-\nphrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder; schizotypal, schizoid, or paranoid\npersonality disorders; autism spectrum disorder; disorders presenting in childhood with\ndisorganized speech; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; obsessive-compulsive dis-\norder; posttraumatic stress disorder; and traumatic brain injury.\nSince the diagnostic criteria for schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia differ\nprimarily in duration of illness, the discussion of the differential diagnosis of schizophre-\nnia also applies to schizophreniform disorder.\nBrief psychotic disorder.\nSchizophreniform disorder differs in duration from brief psy-\nchotic disorder, which has a duration of less than 1 month.\nSchizophreniaMajor depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic or catatonic features.\nThe distinc-\ntion between schizophrenia and major depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic\nfeatures or with catatonia depends on the temporal relationship between the mood distur-\nbance and the psychosis, and on the severity of the depressive or manic symptoms. If de-\nlusions or hallucinations occur exclusively during a major depressive or manic episode,\nthe diagnosis is depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features.\nSchizoaffective disorder.\nA diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that a major\ndepressive or manic episode occur concurrently with the active-phase symptoms and that\nthe mood symptoms be present for a majority of the total duration of the active periods.\nSchizophreniform disorder and brief psychotic disorder.\nThese disorders are of shorter\nduration than schizophrenia as specified in Criterion C, which requires 6 months of symp-\ntoms. In schizophreniform disorder, the disturbance is present less than 6 months, and in\nbrief psychotic disorder, symptoms are present at least 1 day but less than 1 month.\nDelusional disorder.\nDelusional disorder can be distinguished from schizophrenia by\nthe absence of the other symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia (e.g., delusions, prom-\ninent auditory or visual hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or cata-\ntonic behavior, negative symptoms).\nSchizotypal personality disorder.\nSchizotypal personality disorder may be distinguished\nfrom schizophrenia by subthreshold symptoms that are associated with persistent person-\nality features.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder.\nIndividuals with\nobsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder may present with poor or\nabsent insight, and the preoccupations may reach delusional proportions. But these\ndisorders are distinguished from schizophrenia by their prominent obsessions, compul-\nsions, preoccupations with appearance or body odor, hoarding, or body-focused repeti-\ntive behaviors.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder may include flashbacks that\nhave a hallucinatory quality, and hypervigilance may reach paranoid proportions. But a trau-\nSchizoaffective Disorder\n105\nmatic event and characteristic symptom features relating to reliving or reacting to the event\nare required to make the diagnosis.\nAutism spectrum disorder or communication disorders.\nThese disorders may also have\nsymptoms resembling a psychotic episode but are distinguished by their respective defi-\ncits in social interaction with repetitive and restricted behaviors and other cognitive and\ncommunication deficits. An individual with autism spectrum disorder or communication\ndisorder must have symptoms that meet full criteria for schizophrenia, with prominent\nhallucinations or delusions for at least 1 month, in order to be diagnosed with schizophre-\nnia as a comorbid condition.\nOther mental disorders associated with a psychotic episode.\nThe diagnosis of schizo-\nphrenia is made only when the psychotic episode is persistent and not attributable to the\nphysiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. Individuals with a de-\nlirium or major or minor neurocognitive disorder may present with psychotic symptoms,\nbut these would have a temporal relationship to the onset of cognitive changes consistent\nwith those disorders. Individuals with substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder\nmay present with symptoms characteristic of Criterion A for schizophrenia, but the sub-\nstance/medication-induced psychotic disorder can usually be distinguished by the chron-\nological relationship of substance use to the onset and remission of the psychosis in the\nabsence of substance use.Other mental disorders and medical conditions.\nA wide variety of psychiatric and med-\nical conditions can manifest with psychotic and mood symptoms that must be considered\nin the differential diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. These include psychotic disorder\ndue to another medical condition; delirium; major neurocognitive disorder; substance/\nmedication-induced psychotic disorder or neurocognitive disorder; bipolar disorders\nwith psychotic features; major depressive disorder with psychotic features; depressive or\nbipolar disorders with catatonic features; schizotypal, schizoid, or paranoid personality\ndisorder; brief psychotic disorder; schizophreniform disorder; schizophrenia; delusional\ndisorder; and other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic\ndisorders. Medical conditions and substance use can present with a combination of psy-\nchotic and mood symptoms, and thus psychotic disorder due to another medical condition\nneeds to be excluded. Distinguishing schizoaffective disorder from schizophrenia and\nfrom depressive and bipolar disorders with psychotic features is often difficult. Criterion\nC is designed to separate schizoaffective disorder from schizophrenia, and Criterion B is\ndesigned to distinguish schizoaffective disorder from a depressive or bipolar disorder\nwith psychotic features. More specifically, schizoaffective disorder can be distinguished\nfrom a depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features due to the presence of prom-\ninent delusions and/or hallucinations for at least 2 weeks in the absence of a major mood\nepisode. In contrast, in depressive or bipolar disorders with psychotic features, the psy-\nchotic features primarily occur during the mood episode(s). Because the relative propor-\ntion of mood to psychotic symptoms may change over time, the appropriate diagnosis\nmay change from and to schizoaffective disorder (e.g., a diagnosis of schizoaffective dis-\norder for a severe and prominent major depressive episode lasting 3 months during the\nfirst 6 months of a persistent psychotic illness would be changed to schizophrenia if active\npsychotic or prominent residual symptoms persist over several years without a recurrence\nof another mood episode).\nPsychotic disorder due to another medical condition.\nOther medical conditions and\nsubstance use can manifest with a combination of psychotic and mood symptoms, and\nthus psychotic disorder due to another medical condition needs to be excluded.\nSchizophrenia, bipolar, and depressive disorders.\nDistinguishing schizoaffective dis-\norder from schizophrenia and from depressive and bipolar disorders with psychotic fea-\ntures is often difficult. Criterion C is designed to separate schizoaffective disorder from\nschizophrenia, and Criterion B is designed to distinguish schizoaffective disorder from a\n110\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\ndepressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features. More specifically, schizoaffective\ndisorder can be distinguished from a depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features\nbased on the presence of prominent delusions and/or hallucinations for at least 2 weeks in\nthe absence of a major mood episode. In contrast, in depressive or bipolar disorder with\npsychotic features, the psychotic features primarily occur during the mood episode(s). Be-\ncause the relative proportion of mood to psychotic symptoms may change over time, the\nappropriate diagnosis may change from and to schizoaffective disorder. (For example, a\ndiagnosis of schizoaffective disorder for a severe and prominent major depressive episode\nlasting 3 months during the first 6 months of a chronic psychotic illness would be changed\nto schizophrenia if active psychotic or prominent residual symptoms persist over several\nyears without a recurrence of another mood episode.)Substance intoxication or substance withdrawal.\nIndividuals intoxicated with stimu-\nlants, cannabis, the opioid meperidine, or phencyclidine, or those withdrawing from alco-\nhol or sedatives, may experience altered perceptions that they recognize as drug effects. If\nreality testing for these experiences remains intact (i.e., the individual recognizes that the\nperception is substance induced and neither believes in nor acts on it), the diagnosis is not\nsubstance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. Instead, substance intoxication or\nsubstance withdrawal, with perceptual disturbances, is diagnosed (e.g., cocaine intoxica-\ntion, with perceptual disturbances). “Flashback” hallucinations that can occur long after\nthe use of hallucinogens has stopped are diagnosed as hallucinogen persisting perception\ndisorder. If substance/medication-induced psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during\nthe course of a delirium, as in severe forms of alcohol withdrawal, the psychotic symptoms\nare considered to be an associated feature of the delirium and are not diagnosed sepa-\nrately. Delusions in the context of a major or mild neurocognitive disorder would be di-\nagnosed as major or mild neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral disturbance.\nPsychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\n115\nPrimary psychotic disorder.\nA substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder is\ndistinguished from a primary psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective\ndisorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, other specified schizophrenia\nspectrum and other psychotic disorder, or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other\npsychotic disorder, by the fact that a substance is judged to be etiologically related to the\nsymptoms.\nPsychotic disorder due to another medical condition.\nA substance/medication-induced\npsychotic disorder due to a prescribed treatment for a mental or medical condition must\nhave its onset while the individual is receiving the medication (or during withdrawal, if\nthere is a withdrawal syndrome associated with the medication). Because individuals with\nmedical conditions often take medications for those conditions, the clinician must con-\nsider the possibility that the psychotic symptoms are caused by the physiological conse-\nquences of the medical condition rather than the medication, in which case psychotic\ndisorder due to another medical condition is diagnosed. The history often provides the\nprimary basis for such a judgment. At times, a change in the treatment for the medical con-\ndition (e.g., medication substitution or discontinuation) may be needed to determine em-\npirically for that individual whether the medication is the causative agent. If the clinician\nhas ascertained that the disturbance is attributable to both a medical condition and sub-\nstance/medication use, both diagnoses (i.e., psychotic disorder due to another medical\ncondition and substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder) may be given.\nPsychotic Disorder\nDue to Another Medical ConditionDelirium.\nHallucinations and delusions commonly occur in the context of a delirium;\nhowever, a separate diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition is\nnot given if the disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium. Delusions\nin the context of a major or mild neurocognitive disorder would be diagnosed as major or\nmild neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral disturbance.\nSubstance/medication-induced psychotic disorder.\nIf there is evidence of recent or\nprolonged substance use (including medications with psychoactive effects), withdrawal\nfrom a substance, or exposure to a toxin (e.g., LSD [lysergic acid diethylamide] intoxica-\ntion, alcohol withdrawal), a substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder should be\nconsidered. Symptoms that occur during or shortly after (i.e., within 4 weeks) of substance\nintoxication or withdrawal or after medication use may be especially indicative of a sub-\nstance-induced psychotic disorder, depending on the character, duration, or amount of\nthe substance used. If the clinician has ascertained that the disturbance is due to both a\nmedical condition and substance use, both diagnoses (i.e., psychotic disorder due to an-\nother medical condition and substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder) can be\ngiven.\nPsychotic disorder.\nPsychotic disorder due to another medical condition must be distin-\nguished from a psychotic disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, delusional disorder, schizoaffective\ndisorder) or a depressive or bipolar disorder, with psychotic features. In psychotic disor-\nders and in depressive or bipolar disorders, with psychotic features, no specific and direct\ncausative physiological mechanisms associated with a medical condition can be demon-\nstrated. Late age at onset and the absence of a personal or family history of schizophrenia\nor delusional disorder suggest the need for a thorough assessment to rule out the diagno-\nsis of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition. Auditory hallucinations that\ninvolve voices speaking complex sentences are more characteristic of schizophrenia than\nof psychotic disorder due to a medical condition. Other types of hallucinations (e.g., vi-\nsual, olfactory) commonly signal a psychotic disorder due to another medical condition or\na substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder.A separate diagnosis of catatonic disorder due to another medical condition is not given if\nthe catatonia occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium or neuroleptic malignant\nsyndrome. If the individual is currently taking neuroleptic medication, consideration\nshould be given to medication-induced movement disorders (e.g., abnormal positioning\nmay be due to neuroleptic-induced acute dystonia) or neuroleptic malignant syndrome\n(e.g., catatonic-like features may be present, along with associated vital sign and/or labo-\nratory abnormalities). Catatonic symptoms may be present in any of the following five\npsychotic disorders: brief psychotic disorder, schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia,\nschizoaffective disorder, and substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. It may\nalso be present in some of the neurodevelopmental disorders, in all of the bipolar and de-\npressive disorders, and in other mental disorders.\nUnspecified Catatonia\n\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of catatonia\ncause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other impor-\ntant areas of functioning but either the nature of the underlying mental disorder or other\nmedical condition is unclear, full criteria for catatonia are not met, or there is insufficient\ninformation to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).\nCoding note: Code first 781.99 (R29.818) other symptoms involving nervous and muscu-\nloskeletal systems, followed by 293.89 (F06.1) unspecified catatonia.\n122\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\nOther Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and\nOther Psychotic Disorder\n298.8 (F28)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a schizophre-\nnia spectrum and other psychotic disorder that cause clinically significant distress or im-\npairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but\ndo not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the schizophrenia spectrum and other\npsychotic disorders diagnostic class. The other specified schizophrenia spectrum and oth-\ner psychotic disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to com-\nmunicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any\nspecific schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder. This is done by recording “oth-\ner specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder” followed by the specific\nreason (e.g., “persistent auditory hallucinations”).\nExamples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation\ninclude the following:\n1. Persistent auditory hallucinations occurring in the absence of any other features.\n2. Delusions with significant overlapping mood episodes: This includes persistent\ndelusions with periods of overlapping mood episodes that are present for a substantial\nportion of the delusional disturbance (such that the criterion stipulating only brief mood\ndisturbance in delusional disorder is not met).\n3. Attenuated psychosis syndrome: This syndrome is characterized by psychotic-like\nsymptoms that are below a threshold for full psychosis (e.g., the symptoms are less\nsevere and more transient, and insight is relatively maintained).\n4. Delusional symptoms in partner of individual with delusional disorder: In the\ncontext of a relationship, the delusional material from the dominant partner provides\ncontent for delusional belief by the individual who may not otherwise entirely meet cri-\nteria for delusional disorder.\nUnspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and\nOther Psychotic Disorder\n298.9 (F29)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a schizophre-\nnia spectrum and other psychotic disorder that cause clinically significant distress or im-\npairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but\ndo not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the schizophrenia spectrum and oth-\ner psychotic disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and oth-\ner psychotic disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to\nspecify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific schizophrenia spectrum and\nother psychotic disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient informa-\ntion to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).\n123\nBipolar and\nRelated Disorders\nBipolar and related disorders are separated from the depressive disorders in\nDSM-5 and placed between the chapters on schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic\ndisorders and depressive disorders in recognition of their place as a bridge between the\ntwo diagnostic classes in terms of symptomatology, family history, and genetics. The di-\nagnoses included in this chapter are bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, cyclothymic\ndisorder, substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder, bipolar and relat-\ned disorder due to another medical condition, other specified bipolar and related disor-\nder, and unspecified bipolar and related disorder.\nThe bipolar I disorder criteria represent the modern understanding of the classic\nmanic-depressive disorder or affective psychosis described in the nineteenth century, dif-\nfering from that classic description only to the extent that neither psychosis nor the lifetime\nexperience of a major depressive episode is a requirement. However, the vast majority of\nindividuals whose symptoms meet the criteria for a fully syndromal manic episode also\nexperience major depressive episodes during the course of their lives.\nBipolar II disorder, requiring the lifetime experience of at least one episode of major de-\npression and at least one hypomanic episode, is no longer thought to be a “milder” condition\nthan bipolar I disorder, largely because of the amount of time individuals with this con-\ndition spend in depression and because the instability of mood experienced by individuals\nwith bipolar II disorder is typically accompanied by serious impairment in work and social\nfunctioning.\nThe diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder is given to adults who experience at least 2 years\n(for children, a full year) of both hypomanic and depressive periods without ever fulfilling\nthe criteria for an episode of mania, hypomania, or major depression.\nA large number of substances of abuse, some prescribed medications, and several\nmedical conditions can be associated with manic-like phenomena. This fact is recognized\nin the diagnoses of substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder and bipo-\nlar and related disorder due to another medical condition.\nThe recognition that many individuals, particularly children and, to a lesser extent, ad-\nolescents, experience bipolar-like phenomena that do not meet the criteria for bipolar I, bi-\npolar II, or cyclothymic disorder is reflected in the availability of the other specified\nbipolar and related disorder category. Indeed, specific criteria for a disorder involving\nshort-duration hypomania are provided in Section III in the hope of encouraging further\nstudy of this disorder.\nBipolar I DisorderMajor depressive disorder.\nMajor depressive disorder may also be accompanied by hy-\npomanic or manic symptoms (i.e., fewer symptoms or for a shorter duration than required\nfor mania or hypomania). When the individual presents in an episode of major depression,\none must depend on corroborating history regarding past episodes of mania or hypoma-\nnia. Symptoms of irritability may be associated with either major depressive disorder or\nbipolar disorder, adding to diagnostic complexity.\nOther bipolar disorders.\nDiagnosis of bipolar I disorder is differentiated from bipolar II\ndisorder by determining whether there have been any past episodes of mania. Other spec-\nified and unspecified bipolar and related disorders should be differentiated from bipolar I\nand II disorders by considering whether either the episodes involving manic or hypo-\nmanic symptoms or the episodes of depressive symptoms fail to meet the full criteria for\nthose conditions.\nBipolar disorder due to another medical condition may be distinguished from bipolar\nI and II disorders by identifying, based on best clinical evidence, a causally related medical\ncondition.\nGeneralized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, or other\nanxiety disorders.\nThese disorders need to be considered in the differential diagnosis as\neither the primary disorder or, in some cases, a comorbid disorder. A careful history of\nsymptoms is needed to differentiate generalized anxiety disorder from bipolar disorder,\nas anxious ruminations may be mistaken for racing thoughts, and efforts to minimize anx-\nious feelings may be taken as impulsive behavior. Similarly, symptoms of posttraumatic\nstress disorder need to be differentiated from bipolar disorder. It is helpful to assess the ep-\nisodic nature of the symptoms described, as well as to consider symptom triggers, in mak-\ning this differential diagnosis.\nSubstance/medication-induced bipolar disorder.\nSubstance use disorders may mani-\nfest with substance.medication-induced manic symptoms that must be distinguished\nfrom bipolar I disorder; response to mood stabilizers during a substance/medication-\ninduced mania may not necessarily be diagnostic for bipolar disorder. There may be sub-\nstantial overlap in view of the tendency for individuals with bipolar I disorder to overuse\nsubstances during an episode. A primary diagnosis of bipolar disorder must be estab-\nlished based on symptoms that remain once substances are no longer being used.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nThis disorder may be misdiagnosed as bipolar\ndisorder, especially in adolescents and children. Many symptoms overlap with the symp-\n132\nBipolar and Related Disorders\ntoms of mania, such as rapid speech, racing thoughts, distractibility, and less need for\nsleep. The “double counting” of symptoms toward both ADHD and bipolar disorder can\nbe avoided if the clinician clarifies whether the symptom(s) represents a distinct episode.\nPersonality disorders.\nPersonality disorders such as borderline personality disorder\nmay have substantial symptomatic overlap with bipolar disorders, since mood lability\nand impulsivity are common in both conditions. Symptoms must represent a distinct ep-\nisode, and the noticeable increase over baseline required for the diagnosis of bipolar dis-\norder must be present. A diagnosis of a personality disorder should not be made during an\nuntreated mood episode.\nDisorders with prominent irritability.\nIn individuals with severe irritability, particularly\nchildren and adolescents, care must be taken to apply the diagnosis of bipolar disorder\nonly to those who have had a clear episode of mania or hypomania—that is, a distinct time\nperiod, of the required duration, during which the irritability was clearly different from\nthe individual’s baseline and was accompanied by the onset of Criterion B symptoms.\nWhen a child’s irritability is persistent and particularly severe, the diagnosis of disruptive\nmood dysregulation disorder would be more appropriate. Indeed, when any child is being\nassessed for mania, it is essential that the symptoms represent a clear change from the\nchild’s typical behavior.Major depressive disorder.\nPerhaps the most challenging differential diagnosis to con-\nsider is major depressive disorder, which may be accompanied by hypomanic or manic\nsymptoms that do not meet full criteria (i.e., either fewer symptoms or a shorter duration\nthan required for a hypomanic episode). This is especially true in evaluating individuals\nwith symptoms of irritability, which may be associated with either major depressive dis-\norder or bipolar II disorder.\nCyclothymic disorder.\nIn cyclothymic disorder, there are numerous periods of hypo-\nmanic symptoms and numerous periods of depressive symptoms that do not meet symp-\ntom or duration criteria for a major depressive episode. Bipolar II disorder is distinguished\nfrom cyclothymic disorder by the presence of one or more major depressive episodes. If a\nmajor depressive episode occurs after the first 2 years of cyclothymic disorder, the addi-\ntional diagnosis of bipolar II disorder is given.\nSchizophrenia spectrum and other related psychotic disorders.\nBipolar II disorder must\nbe distinguished from psychotic disorders (e.g., schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia,\nand delusional disorder). Schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and delusional disor-\nder are all characterized by periods of psychotic symptoms that occur in the absence of\nprominent mood symptoms. Other helpful considerations include the accompanying\nsymptoms, previous course, and family history.\nPanic disorder or other anxiety disorders.\nAnxiety disorders need to be considered in\nthe differential diagnosis and may frequently be present as co-occurring disorders.\nSubstance use disorders.\nSubstance use disorders are included in the differential diag-\nnosis.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\nmay be misdiagnosed as bipolar II disorder, especially in adolescents and children. Many\nCyclothymic Disorder\n139\nsymptoms of ADHD, such as rapid speech, racing thoughts, distractibility, and less need\nfor sleep, overlap with the symptoms of hypomania. The double counting of symptoms to-\nward both ADHD and bipolar II disorder can be avoided if the clinician clarifies whether\nthe symptoms represent a distinct episode and if the noticeable increase over baseline re-\nquired for the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder is present.\nPersonality disorders.\nThe same convention as applies for ADHD also applies when\nevaluating an individual for a personality disorder such as borderline personality disor-\nder, since mood lability and impulsivity are common in both personality disorders and bi-\npolar II disorder. Symptoms must represent a distinct episode, and the noticeable increase\nover baseline required for the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder must be present. A diagnosis\nof a personality disorder should not be made during an untreated mood episode unless\nthe lifetime history supports the presence of a personality disorder.\nOther bipolar disorders.\nDiagnosis of bipolar II disorder should be differentiated from\nbipolar I disorder by carefully considering whether there have been any past episodes of\nmania and from other specified and unspecified bipolar and related disorders by confirm-\ning the presence of fully syndromal hypomania and depression.Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition and depressive disorder\ndue to another medical condition.\nThe diagnosis of bipolar and related disorder due to\nanother medical condition or depressive disorder due to another medical condition is\nmade when the mood disturbance is judged to be attributable to the physiological effect of\na specific, usually chronic medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism). This determination\nis based on the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. If it is judged that the\nhypomanic and depressive symptoms are not the physiological consequence of the med-\nical condition, then the primary mental disorder (i.e., cyclothymic disorder) and the med-\nical condition are coded. For example, this would be the case if the mood symptoms are\nconsidered to be the psychological (not the physiological) consequence of having a chronic\nmedical condition, or if there is no etiological relationship between the hypomanic and de-\npressive symptoms and the medical condition.\nSubstance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder and substance/medica-\ntion-induced depressive disorder.\nSubstance/medication-induced bipolar and related\ndisorder and substance/medication-induced depressive disorder are distinguished from\ncyclothymic disorder by the judgment that a substance/medication (especially stimu-\nlants) is etiologically related to the mood disturbance. The frequent mood swings in these\ndisorders that are suggestive of cyclothymic disorder usually resolve following cessation\nof substance/medication use.\nBipolar I disorder, with rapid cycling, and bipolar II disorder, with rapid cycling.\nBoth disorders may resemble cyclothymic disorder by virtue of the frequent marked shifts\nin mood. By definition, in cyclothymic disorder the criteria for a major depressive, manic,\nor hypomanic episode has never been met, whereas the bipolar I disorder and bipolar II\ndisorder specifier “with rapid cycling” requires that full mood episodes be present.\nBorderline personality disorder.\nBorderline personality disorder is associated with\nmarked shifts in mood that may suggest cyclothymic disorder. If the criteria are met for\nboth disorders, both borderline personality disorder and cyclothymic disorder may be di-\nagnosed.Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder should be differentiated\nfrom other bipolar disorders, substance intoxication or substance-induced delirium, and\nmedication side effects (as noted earlier). A full manic episode that emerges during anti-\ndepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully\nsyndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for\na bipolar I diagnosis. A full hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant treat-\nment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level\nbeyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a bipolar II di-\nagnosis only if preceded by a major depressive episode.Symptoms of delirium, catatonia, and acute anxiety.\nIt is important to differentiate\nsymptoms of mania from excited or hypervigilant delirious symptoms; from excited cata-\ntonic symptoms; and from agitation related to acute anxiety states.\nMedication-induced depressive or manic symptoms.\nAn important differential diag-\nnostic observation is that the other medical condition may be treated with medications\n(e.g., steroids or alpha-interferon) that can induce depressive or manic symptoms. In these\ncases, clinical judgment using all of the evidence in hand is the best way to try to separate\nthe most likely and/or the most important of two etiological factors (i.e., association with\nthe medical condition vs. a substance/medication-induced syndrome). The differential di-\nagnosis of the associated medical conditions is relevant but largely beyond the scope of the\npresent manual.Because chronically irritable children and adolescents typically present with complex histo-\nries, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder must be made while consid-\nering the presence or absence of multiple other conditions. Despite the need to consider\nDisruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder\n159\nmany other syndromes, differentiation of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from bi-\npolar disorder and oppositional defiant disorder requires particularly careful assessment.\nBipolar disorders.\nThe central feature differentiating disruptive mood dysregulation disor-\nder and bipolar disorders in children involves the longitudinal course of the core symptoms. In\nchildren, as in adults, bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder manifest as an episodic illness\nwith discrete episodes of mood perturbation that can be differentiated from the child’s typical\npresentation. The mood perturbation that occurs during a manic episode is distinctly different\nfrom the child’s usual mood. In addition, during a manic episode, the change in mood must be\naccompanied by the onset, or worsening, of associated cognitive, behavioral, and physical\nsymptoms (e.g., distractibility, increased goal-directed activity), which are also present to a de-\ngree that is distinctly different from the child’s usual baseline. Thus, in the case of a manic ep-\nisode, parents (and, depending on developmental level, children) should be able to identify a\ndistinct time period during which the child’s mood and behavior were markedly different\nfrom usual. In contrast, the irritability of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is persistent\nand is present over many months; while it may wax and wane to a certain degree, severe irri-\ntability is characteristic of the child with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Thus, while\nbipolar disorders are episodic conditions, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is not. In\nfact, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder cannot be assigned to a child\nwho has ever experienced a full-duration hypomanic or manic episode (irritable or euphoric)\nor who has ever had a manic or hypomanic episode lasting more than 1 day. Another central\ndifferentiating feature between bipolar disorders and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder\nis the presence of elevated or expansive mood and grandiosity. These symptoms are common\nfeatures of mania but are not characteristic of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.\nOppositional defiant disorder.\nWhile symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder typi-\ncally do occur in children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, mood symptoms\nof disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are relatively rare in children with opposi-\ntional defiant disorder. The key features that warrant the diagnosis of disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder in children whose symptoms also meet criteria for oppositional de-\nfiant disorder are the presence of severe and frequently recurrent outbursts and a persis-\ntent disruption in mood between outbursts. In addition, the diagnosis of disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder requires severe impairment in at least one setting (i.e., home,\nschool, or among peers) and mild to moderate impairment in a second setting. For this rea-\nson, while most children whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregula-\ntion disorder will also have a presentation that meets criteria for oppositional defiant\ndisorder, the reverse is not the case. That is, in only approximately 15% of individuals with\noppositional defiant disorder would criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder\nbe met. Moreover, even for children in whom criteria for both disorders are met, only the\ndiagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made. Finally, both the\nprominent mood symptoms in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and the high risk\nfor depressive and anxiety disorders in follow-up studies justify placement of disruptive\nmood dysregulation disorder among the depressive disorders in DSM-5. (Oppositional\ndefiant disorder is included in the chapter “Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct\nDisorders.”) This reflects the more prominent mood component among individuals with\ndisruptive mood dysregulation disorder, as compared with individuals with oppositional\ndefiant disorder. Nevertheless, it also should be noted that disruptive mood dysregulation\ndisorder appears to carry a high risk for behavioral problems as well as mood problems.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders,\nand autism spectrum disorder.\nUnlike children diagnosed with bipolar disorder or op-\npositional defiant disorder, a child whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder also can receive a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD, major depressive\ndisorder, and/or anxiety disorder. However, children whose irritability is present only in\nthe context of a major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)\n160\nDepressive Disorders\nshould receive one of those diagnoses rather than disruptive mood dysregulation disor-\nder. Children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder may have symptoms that also\nmeet criteria for an anxiety disorder and can receive both diagnoses, but children whose ir-\nritability is manifest only in the context of exacerbation of an anxiety disorder should re-\nceive the relevant anxiety disorder diagnosis rather than disruptive mood dysregulation\ndisorder. In addition, children with autism spectrum disorders frequently present with\ntemper outbursts when, for example, their routines are disturbed. In that instance, the\ntemper outbursts would be considered secondary to the autism spectrum disorder, and\nthe child should not receive the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.\nIntermittent explosive disorder.\nChildren with symptoms suggestive of intermittent\nexplosive disorder present with instances of severe temper outbursts, much like children\nwith disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. However, unlike disruptive mood dysreg-\nulation disorder, intermittent explosive disorder does not require persistent disruption in\nmood between outbursts. In addition, intermittent explosive disorder requires only 3 months\nof active symptoms, in contrast to the 12-month requirement for disruptive mood dys-\nregulation disorder. Thus, these two diagnoses should not be made in the same child. For\nchildren with outbursts and intercurrent, persistent irritability, only the diagnosis of dis-\nruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made.Manic episodes with irritable mood or mixed episodes.\nMajor depressive episodes\nwith prominent irritable mood may be difficult to distinguish from manic episodes with\nirritable mood or from mixed episodes. This distinction requires a careful clinical evalua-\ntion of the presence of manic symptoms.\nMood disorder due to another medical condition.\nA major depressive episode is the\nappropriate diagnosis if the mood disturbance is not judged, based on individual history,\nphysical examination, and laboratory findings, to be the direct pathophysiological conse-\nquence of a specific medical condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis, stroke, hypothyroidism).\nSubstance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar disorder.\nThis disorder is distin-\nguished from major depressive disorder by the fact that a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse,\na medication, a toxin) appears to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance. For ex-\nample, depressed mood that occurs only in the context of withdrawal from cocaine would\nbe diagnosed as cocaine-induced depressive disorder.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nDistractibility and low frustration tolerance\ncan occur in both attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder and a major depressive epi-\nsode; if the criteria are met for both, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may be diag-\nnosed in addition to the mood disorder. However, the clinician must be cautious not to\noverdiagnose a major depressive episode in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity\ndisorder whose disturbance in mood is characterized by irritability rather than by sadness\nor loss of interest.\n168\nDepressive Disorders\nAdjustment disorder with depressed mood.\nA major depressive episode that occurs in\nresponse to a psychosocial stressor is distinguished from adjustment disorder with de-\npressed mood by the fact that the full criteria for a major depressive episode are not met in\nadjustment disorder.\nSadness.\nFinally, periods of sadness are inherent aspects of the human experience.\nThese periods should not be diagnosed as a major depressive episode unless criteria are\nmet for severity (i.e., five out of nine symptoms), duration (i.e., most of the day, nearly ev-\nery day for at least 2 weeks), and clinically significant distress or impairment. The diagno-\nsis other specified depressive disorder may be appropriate for presentations of depressed\nmood with clinically significant impairment that do not meet criteria for duration or se-\nverity.Major depressive disorder.\nIf there is a depressed mood plus two or more symptoms\nmeeting criteria for a persistent depressive episode for 2 years or more, then the diagnosis of\npersistent depressive disorder is made. The diagnosis depends on the 2-year duration,\nwhich distinguishes it from episodes of depression that do not last 2 years. If the symptom\nPremenstrual Dysphoric Disorder\n171\ncriteria are sufficient for a diagnosis of a major depressive episode at any time during this pe-\nriod, then the diagnosis of major depression should be noted, but it is coded not as a separate\ndiagnosis but rather as a specifier with the diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder. If the\nindividual’s symptoms currently meet full criteria for a major depressive episode, then the\nspecifier of “with intermittent major depressive episodes, with current episode” would be\nmade. If the major depressive episode has persisted for at least a 2-year duration and re-\nmains present, then the specifier “with persistent major depressive episode” is used. When\nfull major depressive episode criteria are not currently met but there has been at least one\nprevious episode of major depression in the context of at least 2 years of persistent depres-\nsive symptoms, then the specifier of “with intermittent major depressive episodes, without\ncurrent episode” is used. If the individual has not experienced an episode of major depres-\nsion in the last 2 years, then the specifier “with pure dysthymic syndrome” is used.\nPsychotic disorders.\nDepressive symptoms are a common associated feature of chronic\npsychotic disorders (e.g., schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, delusional disorder). A\nseparate diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder is not made if the symptoms occur\nonly during the course of the psychotic disorder (including residual phases).\nDepressive or bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition.\nPersistent\ndepressive disorder must be distinguished from a depressive or bipolar and related dis-\norder due to another medical condition. The diagnosis is depressive or bipolar and related\ndisorder due to another medical condition if the mood disturbance is judged, based on his-\ntory, physical examination, or laboratory findings, to be attributable to the direct patho-\nphysiological effects of a specific, usually chronic, medical condition (e.g., multiple\nsclerosis). If it is judged that the depressive symptoms are not attributable to the physiolog-\nical effects of another medical condition, then the primary mental disorder (e.g., persistent\ndepressive disorder) is recorded, and the medical condition is noted as a concomitant med-\nical condition (e.g., diabetes mellitus).\nSubstance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar disorder.\nA substance/medi-\ncation-induced depressive or bipolar and related disorder is distinguished from persis-\ntent depressive disorder when a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, a toxin) is\njudged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance.\nPersonality disorders.\nOften, there is evidence of a coexisting personality disturbance.\nWhen an individual’s presentation meets the criteria for both persistent depressive disor-\nder and a personality disorder, both diagnoses are given.Premenstrual syndrome.\nPremenstrual syndrome differs from premenstrual dysphoric\ndisorder in that a minimum of five symptoms is not required, and there is no stipulation of\naffective symptoms for individuals who have premenstrual syndrome. This condition\nmay be more common than premenstrual dysphoric disorder, although the estimatedSubstance intoxication and withdrawal.\nDepressive symptoms occur commonly in sub-\nstance intoxication and substance withdrawal, and the diagnosis of the substance-specific\nintoxication or withdrawal will usually suffice to categorize the symptom presentation. A\ndiagnosis of substance-induced depressive disorder should be made instead of a diag-\nnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal when the mood symptoms are\nsufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention. For example, dysphoric\nmood is a characteristic feature of cocaine withdrawal. Substance/medication-induced\ndepressive disorder should be diagnosed instead of cocaine withdrawal only if the mood\ndisturbance is substantially more intense or longer lasting than what is usually encountered\nwith cocaine withdrawal and is sufficiently severe to be a separate focus of attention and\ntreatment.\n180\nDepressive Disorders\nPrimary depressive disorder.\nA substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is\ndistinguished from a primary depressive disorder by the fact that a substance is judged to\nbe etiologically related to the symptoms, as described earlier (see section “Development\nand Course” for this disorder).\nDepressive disorder due to another medical condition.\nBecause individuals with other\nmedical conditions often take medications for those conditions, the clinician must consider the\npossibility that the mood symptoms are caused by the physiological consequences of the med-\nical condition rather than the medication, in which case depressive disorder due to another\nmedical condition is diagnosed. The history often provides the primary basis for such a judg-\nment. At times, a change in the treatment for the other medical condition (e.g., medication sub-\nstitution or discontinuation) may be needed to determine empirically whether the medication\nis the causative agent. If the clinician has ascertained that the disturbance is a function of both\nanother medical condition and substance use or withdrawal, both diagnoses (i.e., depressive\ndisorder due to another medical condition and substance/medication-induced depressive\ndisorder) may be given. When there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the depres-\nsive symptoms are associated with substance (including a medication) ingestion or with-\ndrawal or with another medical condition or are primary (i.e., not a function of either a\nsubstance or another medical condition), a diagnosis of other specified depressive disorder or\nunspecified depressive disorder would be indicated.Depressive disorders not due to another medical condition.\nDetermination of whether\na medical condition accompanying a depressive disorder is causing the disorder depends\non a) the absence of an episode(s) of depressive episodes prior to the onset of the medical\nOther Specified Depressive Disorder\n183\ncondition, b) the probability that the associated medical condition has a potential to pro-\nmote or cause a depressive disorder, and c) a course of the depressive symptoms shortly\nafter the onset or worsening of the medical condition, especially if the depressive symp-\ntoms remit near the time that the medical disorder is effectively treated or remits.\nMedication-induced depressive disorder.\nAn important caveat is that some medical con-\nditions are treated with medications (e.g., steroids or alpha-interferon) that can induce depres-\nsive or manic symptoms. In these cases, clinical judgment, based on all the evidence in hand, is\nthe best way to try to separate the most likely and/or the most important of two etiological fac-\ntors (i.e., association with the medical condition vs. a substance-induced syndrome).\nAdjustment disorders.\nIt is important to differentiate a depressive episode from an ad-\njustment disorder, as the onset of the medical condition is in itself a life stressor that could\nbring on either an adjustment disorder or an episode of major depression. The major dif-\nferentiating elements are the pervasiveness the depressive picture and the number and\nquality of the depressive symptoms that the patient reports or demonstrates on the mental\nstatus examination. The differential diagnosis of the associated medical conditions is rel-\nevant but largely beyond the scope of the present manual.Generalized anxiety disorder.\nSeparation anxiety disorder is distinguished from gener-\nalized anxiety disorder in that the anxiety predominantly concerns separation from attach-\nment figures, and if other worries occur, they do not predominate the clinical picture.\nPanic disorder.\nThreats of separation may lead to extreme anxiety and even a panic at-\ntack. In separation anxiety disorder, in contrast to panic disorder, the anxiety concerns the\npossibility of being away from attachment figures and worry about untoward events be-\nfalling them, rather than being incapacitated by an unexpected panic attack.\nAgoraphobia.\nUnlike individuals with agoraphobia, those with separation anxiety dis-\norder are not anxious about being trapped or incapacitated in situations from which es-\ncape is perceived as difficult in the event of panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating\nsymptoms.\nConduct disorder.\nSchool avoidance (truancy) is common in conduct disorder, but anx-\niety about separation is not responsible for school absences, and the child or adolescent\nusually stays away from, rather than returns to, the home.\nSocial anxiety disorder.\nSchool refusal may be due to social anxiety disorder (social pho-\nbia). In such instances, the school avoidance is due to fear of being judged negatively by oth-\ners rather than to worries about being separated from the attachment figures.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder.\nFear of separation from loved ones is common after trau-\nmatic events such as a disasters, particularly when periods of separation from loved ones\nwere experienced during the traumatic event. In posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the\ncentral symptoms concern intrusions about, and avoidance of, memories associated with\nthe traumatic event itself, whereas in separation anxiety disorder, the worries and avoid-\nance concern the well-being of attachment figures and separation from them.\nIllness anxiety disorder.\nIndividuals with illness anxiety disorder worry about specific\nillnesses they may have, but the main concern is about the medical diagnosis itself, not\nabout being separated from attachment figures.\nBereavement.\nIntense yearning or longing for the deceased, intense sorrow and emo-\ntional pain, and preoccupation with the deceased or the circumstances of the death are ex-\npected responses occurring in bereavement, whereas fear of separation from other\nattachment figures is central in separation anxiety disorder.\nDepressive and bipolar disorders.\nThese disorders may be associated with reluctance\nto leave home, but the main concern is not worry or fear of untoward events befalling at-\ntachment figures, but rather low motivation for engaging with the outside world. How-\never, individuals with separation anxiety disorder may become depressed while being\nseparated or in anticipation of separation.\nOppositional defiant disorder.\nChildren and adolescents with separation anxiety disor-\nder may be oppositional in the context of being forced to separate from attachment figures.\nOppositional defiant disorder should be considered only when there is persistent opposi-\ntional behavior unrelated to the anticipation or occurrence of separation from attachment\nfigures.\nPsychotic disorders.\nUnlike the hallucinations in psychotic disorders, the unusual per-\nceptual experiences that may occur in separation anxiety disorder are usually based on a\nmisperception of an actual stimulus, occur only in certain situations (e.g., nighttime), and\nare reversed by the presence of an attachment figure.\nSelective Mutism\n195\nPersonality disorders.\nDependent personality disorder is characterized by an indis-\ncriminate tendency to rely on others, whereas separation anxiety disorder involves con-\ncern about the proximity and safety of main attachment figures. Borderline personality\ndisorder is characterized by fear of abandonment by loved ones, but problems in identity,\nself-direction, interpersonal functioning, and impulsivity are additionally central to that\ndisorder, whereas they are not central to separation anxiety disorder.Communication disorders.\nSelective mutism should be distinguished from speech dis-\nturbances that are better explained by a communication disorder, such as language\ndisorder, speech sound disorder (previously phonological disorder), childhood-onset\nfluency disorder (stuttering), or pragmatic (social) communication disorder. Unlike selec-\ntive mutism, the speech disturbance in these conditions is not restricted to a specific social\nsituation.\nNeurodevelopmental disorders and schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.\nIndividuals with an autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia or another psychotic disor-\nder, or severe intellectual disability may have problems in social communication and be\nunable to speak appropriately in social situations. In contrast, selective mutism should be\ndiagnosed only when a child has an established capacity to speak in some social situations\n(e.g., typically at home).\nSocial anxiety disorder (social phobia).\nThe social anxiety and social avoidance in so-\ncial anxiety disorder may be associated with selective mutism. In such cases, both diagno-\nses may be given.Agoraphobia.\nSituational specific phobia may resemble agoraphobia in its clinical pre-\nsentation, given the overlap in feared situations (e.g., flying, enclosed places, elevators). If\nan individual fears only one of the agoraphobia situations, then specific phobia, situa-\ntional, may be diagnosed. If two or more agoraphobic situations are feared, a diagnosis of\nagoraphobia is likely warranted. For example, an individual who fears airplanes and ele-\nvators (which overlap with the “public transportation” agoraphobic situation) but does\nnot fear other agoraphobic situations would be diagnosed with specific phobia, situa-\ntional, whereas an individual who fears airplanes, elevators, and crowds (which overlap\nwith two agoraphobic situations, “using public transportation” and “standing in line and\nor being in a crowd”) would be diagnosed with agoraphobia. Criterion B of agoraphobia\n(the situations are feared or avoided “because of thoughts that escape might be difficult or\nhelp might not be available in the event of developing panic-like symptoms or other inca-\npacitating or embarrassing symptoms”) can also be useful in differentiating agoraphobia\nfrom specific phobia. If the situations are feared for other reasons, such as fear of being\nharmed directly by the object or situations (e.g., fear of the plane crashing, fear of the an-\nimal biting), a specific phobia diagnosis may be more appropriate.\nSocial anxiety disorder.\nIf the situations are feared because of negative evaluation, so-\ncial anxiety disorder should be diagnosed instead of specific phobia.\nSeparation anxiety disorder.\nIf the situations are feared because of separation from a\nprimary caregiver or attachment figure, separation anxiety disorder should be diagnosed\ninstead of specific phobia.\n202\nAnxiety Disorders\nPanic disorder.\nIndividuals with specific phobia may experience panic attacks when con-\nfronted with their feared situation or object. A diagnosis of specific phobia would be given if\nthe panic attacks only occurred in response to the specific object or situation, whereas a di-\nagnosis of panic disorder would be given if the individual also experienced panic attacks\nthat were unexpected (i.e., not in response to the specific phobia object or situation).\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nIf an individual’s primary fear or anxiety is of an ob-\nject or situation as a result of obsessions (e.g., fear of blood due to obsessive thoughts about\ncontamination from blood-borne pathogens [i.e., HIV]; fear of driving due to obsessive im-\nages of harming others), and if other diagnostic criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder\nare met, then obsessive-compulsive disorder should be diagnosed.\nTrauma- and stressor-related disorders.\nIf the phobia develops following a traumatic\nevent, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) should be considered as a diagnosis. How-\never, traumatic events can precede the onset of PTSD and specific phobia. In this case, a di-\nagnosis of specific phobia would be assigned only if all of the criteria for PTSD are not met.\nEating disorders.\nA diagnosis of specific phobia is not given if the avoidance behavior is\nexclusively limited to avoidance of food and food-related cues, in which case a diagnosis\nof anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa should be considered.\nSchizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.\nWhen the fear and avoidance\nare due to delusional thinking (as in schizophrenia or other schizophrenia spectrum and\nother psychotic disorders), a diagnosis of specific phobia is not warranted.Normative shyness.\nShyness (i.e., social reticence) is a common personality trait and is\nnot by itself pathological. In some societies, shyness is even evaluated positively. How-\never, when there is a significant adverse impact on social, occupational, and other impor-\ntant areas of functioning, a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder should be considered, and\nwhen full diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder are met, the disorder should be di-\nagnosed. Only a minority (12%) of self-identified shy individuals in the United States have\nsymptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder.\nAgoraphobia.\nIndividuals with agoraphobia may fear and avoid social situations (e.g., go-\ning to a movie) because escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of\nincapacitation or panic-like symptoms, whereas individuals with social anxiety disorder are\nmost fearful of scrutiny by others. Moreover, individuals with social anxiety disorder are likely\nto be calm when left entirely alone, which is often not the case in agoraphobia.\nPanic disorder.\nIndividuals with social anxiety disorder may have panic attacks, but the\nconcern is about fear of negative evaluation, whereas in panic disorder the concern is\nabout the panic attacks themselves.\nGeneralized anxiety disorder.\nSocial worries are common in generalized anxiety disorder,\nbut the focus is more on the nature of ongoing relationships rather than on fear of negative\nevaluation. Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder, particularly children, may have ex-\ncessive worries about the quality of their social performance, but these worries also pertain to\nnonsocial performance and when the individual is not being evaluated by others. In social anx-\niety disorder, the worries focus on social performance and others’ evaluation.\nSeparation anxiety disorder.\nIndividuals with separation anxiety disorder may avoid\nsocial settings (including school refusal) because of concerns about being separated from\nattachment figures or, in children, about requiring the presence of a parent when it is not\ndevelopmentally appropriate. Individuals with separation anxiety disorder are usually\ncomfortable in social settings when their attachment figure is present or when they are at\nSocial Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)\n207\nhome, whereas those with social anxiety disorder may be uncomfortable when social sit-\nuations occur at home or in the presence of attachment figures.\nSpecific phobias.\nIndividuals with specific phobias may fear embarrassment or humil-\niation (e.g., embarrassment about fainting when they have their blood drawn), but they do\nnot generally fear negative evaluation in other social situations.\nSelective mutism.\nIndividuals with selective mutism may fail to speak because of fear of\nnegative evaluation, but they do not fear negative evaluation in social situations where no\nspeaking is required (e.g., nonverbal play).\nMajor depressive disorder.\nIndividuals with major depressive disorder may be con-\ncerned about being negatively evaluated by others because they feel they are bad or not\nworthy of being liked. In contrast, individuals with social anxiety disorder are worried\nabout being negatively evaluated because of certain social behaviors or physical symptoms.\nBody dysmorphic disorder.\nIndividuals with body dysmorphic disorder are preoccu-\npied with one or more perceived defects or flaws in their physical appearance that are not\nobservable or appear slight to others; this preoccupation often causes social anxiety and\navoidance. If their social fears and avoidance are caused only by their beliefs about their\nappearance, a separate diagnosis of social anxiety disorder is not warranted.\nDelusional disorder.\nIndividuals with delusional disorder may have nonbizarre delu-\nsions and/or hallucinations related to the delusional theme that focus on being rejected by\nor offending others. Although extent of insight into beliefs about social situations may\nvary, many individuals with social anxiety disorder have good insight that their beliefs are\nout of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation.\nAutism spectrum disorder.\nSocial anxiety and social communication deficits are hall-\nmarks of autism spectrum disorder. Individuals with social anxiety disorder typically\nhave adequate age-appropriate social relationships and social communication capacity,\nalthough they may appear to have impairment in these areas when first interacting with\nunfamiliar peers or adults.\nPersonality disorders.\nGiven its frequent onset in childhood and its persistence into and\nthrough adulthood, social anxiety disorder may resemble a personality disorder. The most\napparent overlap is with avoidant personality disorder. Individuals with avoidant person-\nality disorder have a broader avoidance pattern than those with social anxiety disorder.\nNonetheless, social anxiety disorder is typically more comorbid with avoidant personality\ndisorder than with other personality disorders, and avoidant personality disorder is more\ncomorbid with social anxiety disorder than with other anxiety disorders.\nOther mental disorders.\nSocial fears and discomfort can occur as part of schizophrenia,\nbut other evidence for psychotic symptoms is usually present. In individuals with an eat-\ning disorder, it is important to determine that fear of negative evaluation about eating\ndisorder symptoms or behaviors (e.g., purging and vomiting) is not the sole source of so-\ncial anxiety before applying a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder. Similarly, obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder may be associated with social anxiety, but the additional diagnosis of\nsocial anxiety disorder is used only when social fears and avoidance are independent of\nthe foci of the obsessions and compulsions.\nOther medical conditions.\nMedical conditions may produce symptoms that may be em-\nbarrassing (e.g. trembling in Parkinson’s disease). When the fear of negative evaluation\ndue to other medical conditions is excessive, a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder should\nbe considered.\nOppositional defiant disorder.\nRefusal to speak due to opposition to authority figures\nshould be differentiated from failure to speak due to fear of negative evaluation.\n208\nAnxiety DisordersOther specified anxiety disorder or unspecified anxiety disorder.\nPanic disorder should\nnot be diagnosed if full-symptom (unexpected) panic attacks have never been experienced. In\nPanic Disorder\n213\nthe case of only limited-symptom unexpected panic attacks, an other specified anxiety dis-\norder or unspecified anxiety disorder diagnosis should be considered.\nAnxiety disorder due to another medical condition.\nPanic disorder is not diagnosed if\nthe panic attacks are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of another medical\ncondition. Examples of medical conditions that can cause panic attacks include hyperthy-\nroidism, hyperparathyroidism, pheochromocytoma, vestibular dysfunctions, seizure dis-\norders, and cardiopulmonary conditions (e.g., arrhythmias, supraventricular tachycardia,\nasthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]). Appropriate laboratory tests\n(e.g., serum calcium levels for hyperparathyroidism; Holter monitor for arrhythmias) or\nphysical examinations (e.g., for cardiac conditions) may be helpful in determining the eti-\nological role of another medical condition.\nSubstance/medication-induced anxiety disorder.\nPanic disorder is not diagnosed if\nthe panic attacks are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a substance. In-\ntoxication with central nervous system stimulants (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines, caffeine)\nor cannabis and withdrawal from central nervous system depressants (e.g., alcohol, bar-\nbiturates) can precipitate a panic attack. However, if panic attacks continue to occur out-\nside of the context of substance use (e.g., long after the effects of intoxication or withdrawal\nhave ended), a diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered. In addition, because\npanic disorder may precede substance use in some individuals and may be associated\nwith increased substance use, especially for purposes of self-medication, a detailed history\nshould be taken to determine if the individual had panic attacks prior to excessive sub-\nstance use. If this is the case, a diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered in addition\nto a diagnosis of substance use disorder. Features such as onset after age 45 years or the\npresence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack (e.g., vertigo, loss of consciousness,\nloss of bladder or bowel control, slurred speech, amnesia) suggest the possibility that an-\nother medical condition or a substance may be causing the panic attack symptoms.\nOther mental disorders with panic attacks as an associated feature (e.g., other anxiety\ndisorders and psychotic disorders).\nPanic attacks that occur as a symptom of other anx-\niety disorders are expected (e.g., triggered by social situations in social anxiety disorder, by\nphobic objects or situations in specific phobia or agoraphobia, by worry in generalized anx-\niety disorder, by separation from home or attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder)\nand thus would not meet criteria for panic disorder. (Note: Sometimes an unexpected panic\nattack is associated with the onset of another anxiety disorder, but then the attacks become\nexpected, whereas panic disorder is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks.) If\nthe panic attacks occur only in response to specific triggers, then only the relevant anxiety\ndisorder is assigned. However, if the individual experiences unexpected panic attacks as\nwell and shows persistent concern and worry or behavioral change because of the attacks,\nthen an additional diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered.Other paroxysmal episodes (e.g., “anger attacks”).\nPanic attacks should not be diag-\nnosed if the episodes do not involve the essential feature of an abrupt surge of intense fear\nor intense discomfort, but rather other emotional states (e.g., anger, grief).\nAnxiety disorder due to another medical condition.\nMedical conditions that can cause\nor be misdiagnosed as panic attacks include hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, pheo-\nchromocytoma, vestibular dysfunctions, seizure disorders, and cardiopulmonary con-\nditions (e.g., arrhythmias, supraventricular tachycardia, asthma, chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease). Appropriate laboratory tests (e.g., serum calcium levels for hyperpara-\nthyroidism; Holter monitor for arrhythmias) or physical examinations (e.g., for cardiac con-\nditions) may be helpful in determining the etiological role of another medical condition.\nSubstance/medication-induced anxiety disorder.\nIntoxication with central nervous\nsystem stimulants (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines, caffeine) or cannabis and withdrawal\nfrom central nervous system depressants (e.g., alcohol, barbiturates) can precipitate a\npanic attack. A detailed history should be taken to determine if the individual had panic\nattacks prior to excessive substance use. Features such as onset after age 45 years or the\npresence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack (e.g., vertigo, loss of consciousness,\nloss of bladder or bowel control, slurred speech, or amnesia) suggest the possibility that a\nmedical condition or a substance may be causing the panic attack symptoms.\nPanic disorder.\nRepeated unexpected panic attacks are required but are not sufficient for\nthe diagnosis of panic disorder (i.e., full diagnostic criteria for panic disorder must be met).When diagnostic criteria for agoraphobia and another disorder are fully met, both diagnoses\nshould be assigned, unless the fear, anxiety, or avoidance of agoraphobia is attributable to the\nother disorder. Weighting of criteria and clinical judgment may be helpful in some cases.\nAgoraphobia\n221\nSpecific phobia, situational type.\nDifferentiating agoraphobia from situational specific\nphobia can be challenging in some cases, because these conditions share several symptom\ncharacteristics and criteria. Specific phobia, situational type, should be diagnosed versus ago-\nraphobia if the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is limited to one of the agoraphobic situations.\nRequiring fears from two or more of the agoraphobic situations is a robust means for differen-\ntiating agoraphobia from specific phobias, particularly the situational subtype. Additional dif-\nferentiating features include the cognitive ideation. Thus, if the situation is feared for reasons\nother than panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms (e.g., fears\nof being directly harmed by the situation itself, such as fear of the plane crashing for individ-\nuals who fear flying), then a diagnosis of specific phobia may be more appropriate.\nSeparation anxiety disorder.\nSeparation anxiety disorder can be best differentiated\nfrom agoraphobia by examining cognitive ideation. In separation anxiety disorder, the\nthoughts are about detachment from significant others and the home environment (i.e.,\nparents or other attachment figures), whereas in agoraphobia the focus is on panic-like\nsymptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms in the feared situations.\nSocial anxiety disorder (social phobia).\nAgoraphobia should be differentiated from so-\ncial anxiety disorder based primarily on the situational clusters that trigger fear, anxiety,\nor avoidance and the cognitive ideation. In social anxiety disorder, the focus is on fear of\nbeing negatively evaluated.\nPanic disorder.\nWhen criteria for panic disorder are met, agoraphobia should not be di-\nagnosed if the avoidance behaviors associated with the panic attacks do not extend to avoid-\nance of two or more agoraphobic situations.\nAcute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder.\nAcute stress disorder and\nposttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be differentiated from agoraphobia by examin-\ning whether the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is related only to situations that remind the\nindividual of a traumatic event. If the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is restricted to trauma re-\nminders, and if the avoidance behavior does not extend to two or more agoraphobic situ-\nations, then a diagnosis of agoraphobia is not warranted.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nIn major depressive disorder, the individual may avoid leav-\ning home because of apathy, loss of energy, low self-esteem, and anhedonia. If the avoid-\nance is unrelated to fears of panic-like or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms,\nthen agoraphobia should not be diagnosed.\nOther medical conditions.\nAgoraphobia is not diagnosed if the avoidance of situations\nis judged to be a physiological consequence of a medical condition. This determination is\nbased on history, laboratory findings, and a physical examination. Other relevant medical\nconditions may include neurodegenerative disorders with associated motor disturbances\n(e.g., Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis), as well as cardiovascular disorders. Individ-\nuals with certain medical conditions may avoid situations because of realistic concerns\nabout being incapacitated (e.g., fainting in an individual with transient ischemic attacks)\nor being embarrassed (e.g., diarrhea in an individual with Crohn’s disease). The diagnosis\nof agoraphobia should be given only when the fear or avoidance is clearly in excess of that\nusually associated with these medical conditions.Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition.\nThe diagnosis of anxiety disorder\nassociated with another medical condition should be assigned if the individual’s anxiety\nand worry are judged, based on history, laboratory findings, or physical examination, to\nbe a physiological effect of another specific medical condition (e.g., pheochromocytoma,\nhyperthyroidism).\nSubstance/medication-induced anxiety disorder.\nA substance/medication-induced\nanxiety disorder is distinguished from generalized anxiety disorder by the fact that a sub-\nstance or medication (e.g., a drug of abuse, exposure to a toxin) is judged to be etiologically\nrelated to the anxiety. For example, severe anxiety that occurs only in the context of heavy\ncoffee consumption would be diagnosed as caffeine-induced anxiety disorder.\nSocial anxiety disorder.\nIndividuals with social anxiety disorder often have anticipa-\ntory anxiety that is focused on upcoming social situations in which they must perform or\nbe evaluated by others, whereas individuals with generalized anxiety disorder worry,\nwhether or not they are being evaluated.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nSeveral features distinguish the excessive worry of\ngeneralized anxiety disorder from the obsessional thoughts of obsessive-compulsive dis-\norder. In generalized anxiety disorder the focus of the worry is about forthcoming prob-\nlems, and it is the excessiveness of the worry about future events that is abnormal. In\nobsessive-compulsive disorder, the obsessions are inappropriate ideas that take the form of\nintrusive and unwanted thoughts, urges, or images.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder and adjustment disorders.\nAnxiety is invariably pres-\nent in posttraumatic stress disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder is not diagnosed if the\nanxiety and worry are better explained by symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder.\nAnxiety may also be present in adjustment disorder, but this residual category should be\nused only when the criteria are not met for any other disorder (including generalized anx-\niety disorder). Moreover, in adjustment disorders, the anxiety occurs in response to an\nidentifiable stressor within 3 months of the onset of the stressor and does not persist for\nmore than 6 months after the termination of the stressor or its consequences.\nDepressive, bipolar, and psychotic disorders.\nGeneralized anxiety/worry is a common\nassociated feature of depressive, bipolar, and psychotic disorders and should not be di-\n226\nAnxiety Disorders\nagnosed separately if the excessive worry has occurred only during the course of these\nconditions.Substance intoxication and substance withdrawal.\nAnxiety symptoms commonly oc-\ncur in substance intoxication and substance withdrawal. The diagnosis of the substance-\nspecific intoxication or substance-specific withdrawal will usually suffice to categorize the\nsymptom presentation. A diagnosis of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder\nshould be made in addition to substance intoxication or substance withdrawal when the\npanic or anxiety symptoms are predominant in the clinical picture and are sufficiently se-\nvere to warrant independent clinical attention. For example, panic or anxiety symptoms\nare characteristic of alcohol withdrawal.\nAnxiety disorder (i.e., not induced by a substance/medication).\nSubstance/medication-\ninduced anxiety disorder is judged to be etiologically related to the substance/medication.\nSubstance/medication-induced anxiety disorder is distinguished from a primary anxiety\ndisorder based on the onset, course, and other factors with respect to substances/medica-\ntions. For drugs of abuse, there must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or\nlaboratory findings for use, intoxication, or withdrawal. Substance/medication-induced\nanxiety disorders arise only in association with intoxication or withdrawal states, whereas\nprimary anxiety disorders may precede the onset of substance/medication use. The pres-\nence of features that are atypical of a primary anxiety disorder, such as atypical age at onset\n(e.g., onset of panic disorder after age 45 years) or symptoms (e.g., atypical panic attack\nsymptoms such as true vertigo, loss of balance, loss of consciousness, loss of bladder con-\ntrol, headaches, slurred speech) may suggest a substance/medication-induced etiology. A\nprimary anxiety disorder diagnosis is warranted if the panic or anxiety symptoms persist\nfor a substantial period of time (about 1 month or longer) after the end of the substance in-\ntoxication or acute withdrawal or there is a history of an anxiety disorder.\nDelirium.\nIf panic or anxiety symptoms occur exclusively during the course of delirium,\nthey are considered to be an associated feature of the delirium and are not diagnosed sep-\narately.\nAnxiety disorder due to another medical condition.\nIf the panic or anxiety symptoms\nare attributed to the physiological consequences of another medical condition (i.e., rather\nthan to the medication taken for the medical condition), anxiety disorder due to another\n230\nAnxiety Disorders\nmedical condition should be diagnosed. The history often provides the basis for such a\njudgment. At times, a change in the treatment for the other medical condition (e.g., med-\nication substitution or discontinuation) may be needed to determine whether the medica-\ntion is the causative agent (in which case the symptoms may be better explained by\nsubstance/medication-induced anxiety disorder). If the disturbance is attributable to both\nanother medical condition and substance use, both diagnoses (i.e., anxiety disorder due to\nanother medical condition and substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder) may be\ngiven. When there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the panic or anxiety symp-\ntoms are attributable to a substance/medication or to another medical condition or are pri-\nmary (i.e., not attributable to either a substance or another medical condition), a diagnosis\nof other specified or unspecified anxiety disorder would be indicated.\nAnxiety Disorder Due to\nAnother Medical ConditionDelirium.\nA separate diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition is\nnot given if the anxiety disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium.\nHowever, a diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition may be given\nin addition to a diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) if the etiology of\nanxiety is judged to be a physiological consequence of the pathological process causing the\nneurocognitive disorder and if anxiety is a prominent part of the clinical presentation.\nMixed presentation of symptoms (e.g., mood and anxiety).\nIf the presentation includes\na mix of different types of symptoms, the specific mental disorder due to another medical\ncondition depends on which symptoms predominate in the clinical picture.\nSubstance/medication-induced anxiety disorder.\nIf there is evidence of recent or pro-\nlonged substance use (including medications with psychoactive effects), withdrawal from\n232\nAnxiety Disorders\na substance, or exposure to a toxin, a substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder\nshould be considered. Certain medications are known to increase anxiety (e.g., corticoste-\nroids, estrogens, metoclopramide), and when this is the case, the medication may be the\nmost likely etiology, although it may be difficult to distinguish whether the anxiety is at-\ntributable to the medications or to the medical illness itself. When a diagnosis of substance-\ninduced anxiety is being made in relation to recreational or nonprescribed drugs, it may be\nuseful to obtain a urine or blood drug screen or other appropriate laboratory evaluation.\nSymptoms that occur during or shortly after (i.e., within 4 weeks of) substance intoxication\nor withdrawal or after medication use may be especially indicative of a substance/medi-\ncation-induced anxiety disorder, depending on the type, duration, or amount of the sub-\nstance used. If the disturbance is associated with both another medical condition and\nsubstance use, both diagnoses (i.e., anxiety disorder due to another medical condition and\nsubstance/medication-induced anxiety disorder) can be given. Features such as onset af-\nter age 45 years or the presence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack (e.g., vertigo,\nloss of consciousness, loss of bladder or bowel control, slurred speech, amnesia) suggest\nthe possibility that another medical condition or a substance may be causing the panic at-\ntack symptoms.\nAnxiety disorder (not due to a known medical condition).\nAnxiety disorder due to an-\nother medical condition should be distinguished from other anxiety disorders (especially\npanic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder). In other anxiety disorders, no specific\nand direct causative physiological mechanisms associated with another medical condition\ncan be demonstrated. Late age at onset, atypical symptoms, and the absence of a personal\nor family history of anxiety disorders suggest the need for a thorough assessment to rule\nout the diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition. Anxiety disorders\ncan exacerbate or pose increased risk for medical conditions such as cardiovascular events\nand myocardial infarction and should not be diagnosed as anxiety disorder due to another\nmedical condition in these cases.\nIllness anxiety disorder.\nAnxiety disorder due to another medical condition should be\ndistinguished from illness anxiety disorder. Illness anxiety disorder is characterized by\nworry about illness, concern about pain, and bodily preoccupations. In the case of illness\nanxiety disorder, individuals may or may not have diagnosed medical conditions. Al-\nthough an individual with illness anxiety disorder and a diagnosed medical condition is\nlikely to experience anxiety about the medical condition, the medical condition is not\nphysiologically related to the anxiety symptoms.\nAdjustment disorders.\nAnxiety disorder due to another medical condition should be\ndistinguished from adjustment disorders, with anxiety, or with anxiety and depressed\nmood. Adjustment disorder is warranted when individuals experience a maladaptive re-\nsponse to the stress of having another medical condition. The reaction to stress usually\nconcerns the meaning or consequences of the stress, as compared with the experience of\nanxiety or mood symptoms that occur as a physiological consequence of the other medical\ncondition. In adjustment disorder, the anxiety symptoms are typically related to coping\nwith the stress of having a general medical condition, whereas in anxiety disorder due to\nanother medical condition, individuals are more likely to have prominent physical symp-\ntoms and to be focused on issues other than the stress of the illness itself.\nAssociated feature of another mental disorder.\nAnxiety symptoms may be an associ-\nated feature of another mental disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa).\nOther specified or unspecified anxiety disorder.\nThis diagnosis is given if it cannot be\ndetermined whether the anxiety symptoms are primary, substance-induced, or associated\nwith another medical condition.\nOther Specified Anxiety Disorder\n233\nOther Specified Anxiety Disorder\n300.09 (F41.8)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an anxiety dis-\norder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or oth-\ner important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the\ndisorders in the anxiety disorders diagnostic class. The other specified anxiety disorder\ncategory is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific\nreason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific anxiety disorder.\nThis is done by recording “other specified anxiety disorder” followed by the specific reason\n(e.g., “generalized anxiety not occurring more days than not”).\nExamples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation\ninclude the following:\n1. Limited-symptom attacks.\n2. Generalized anxiety not occurring more days than not.\n3. Khyâl cap (wind attacks): See “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the Ap-\npendix.\n4. Ataque de nervios (attack of nerves): See “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress”\nin the Appendix.\nUnspecified Anxiety Disorder\n300.00 (F41.9)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an anxiety dis-\norder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or oth-\ner important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the\ndisorders in the anxiety disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified anxiety disorder cate-\ngory is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the\ncriteria are not met for a specific anxiety disorder, and includes presentations in which\nthere is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room\nsettings).\nThis page intentionally left blank\n235\nObsessive-Compulsive and\nRelated Disorders\nObsessive-compulsive and related disorders include obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder (OCD), body dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder, trichotillomania (hair-\npulling disorder), excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, substance/medication-induced ob-\nsessive-compulsive and related disorder, obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due\nto another medical condition, and other specified obsessive-compulsive and related dis-\norder and unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (e.g., body-focused re-\npetitive behavior disorder, obsessional jealousy).\nOCD is characterized by the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions\nare recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced as intrusive\nand unwanted, whereas compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that an indi-\nvidual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must\nbe applied rigidly. Some other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders are also char-\nacterized by preoccupations and by repetitive behaviors or mental acts in response to the\npreoccupations. Other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders are characterized pri-\nmarily by recurrent body-focused repetitive behaviors (e.g., hair pulling, skin picking) and\nrepeated attempts to decrease or stop the behaviors.\nThe inclusion of a chapter on obsessive-compulsive and related disorders in DSM-5 re-\nflects the increasing evidence of these disorders’ relatedness to one another in terms of a\nrange of diagnostic validators as well as the clinical utility of grouping these disorders in\nthe same chapter. Clinicians are encouraged to screen for these conditions in individuals\nwho present with one of them and be aware of overlaps between these conditions. At the\nsame time, there are important differences in diagnostic validators and treatment ap-\nproaches across these disorders. Moreover, there are close relationships between the anx-\niety disorders and some of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (e.g., OCD),\nwhich is reflected in the sequence of DSM-5 chapters, with obsessive-compulsive and re-\nlated disorders following anxiety disorders.\nThe obsessive-compulsive and related disorders differ from developmentally norma-\ntive preoccupations and rituals by being excessive or persisting beyond developmentally\nappropriate periods. The distinction between the presence of subclinical symptoms and a\nclinical disorder requires assessment of a number of factors, including the individual’s\nlevel of distress and impairment in functioning.\nThe chapter begins with OCD. It then covers body dysmorphic disorder and hoarding\ndisorder, which are characterized by cognitive symptoms such as perceived defects or\nflaws in physical appearance or the perceived need to save possessions, respectively. The\nchapter then covers trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) and excoriation (skin-picking)\ndisorder, which are characterized by recurrent body-focused repetitive behaviors. Finally,\nit covers substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder,\nobsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition, and other\nspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder and unspecified obsessive-compul-\nsive and related disorder.\nWhile the specific content of obsessions and compulsions varies among individuals,\ncertain symptom dimensions are common in OCD, including those of cleaning (contami-\nnation obsessions and cleaning compulsions); symmetry (symmetry obsessions and repeat-\n236\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\ning, ordering, and counting compulsions); forbidden or taboo thoughts (e.g., aggressive,\nsexual, and religious obsessions and related compulsions); and harm (e.g., fears of harm to\noneself or others and related checking compulsions). The tic-related specifier of OCD is\nused when an individual has a current or past history of a tic disorder.\nBody dysmorphic disorder is characterized by preoccupation with one or more per-\nceived defects or flaws in physical appearance that are not observable or appear only slight\nto others, and by repetitive behaviors (e.g., mirror checking, excessive grooming, skin\npicking, or reassurance seeking) or mental acts (e.g., comparing one’s appearance with that\nof other people) in response to the appearance concerns. The appearance preoccupations\nare not better explained by concerns with body fat or weight in an individual with an eat-\ning disorder. Muscle dysmorphia is a form of body dysmorphic disorder that is character-\nized by the belief that one’s body build is too small or is insufficiently muscular.\nHoarding disorder is characterized by persistent difficulty discarding or parting with\npossessions, regardless of their actual value, as a result of a strong perceived need to save\nthe items and to distress associated with discarding them. Hoarding disorder differs from\nnormal collecting. For example, symptoms of hoarding disorder result in the accumula-\ntion of a large number of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas to the ex-\ntent that their intended use is substantially compromised. The excessive acquisition form\nof hoarding disorder, which characterizes most but not all individuals with hoarding dis-\norder, consists of excessive collecting, buying, or stealing of items that are not needed or\nfor which there is no available space.\nTrichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) is characterized by recurrent pulling out of\none's hair resulting in hair loss, and repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling.\nExcoriation (skin-picking) disorder is characterized by recurrent picking of one’s skin re-\nsulting in skin lesions and repeated attempts to decrease or stop skin picking. The body-\nfocused repetitive behaviors that characterize these two disorders are not triggered by ob-\nsessions or preoccupations; however, they may be preceded or accompanied by various\nemotional states, such as feelings of anxiety or boredom. They may also be preceded by an\nincreasing sense of tension or may lead to gratification, pleasure, or a sense of relief when\nthe hair is pulled out or the skin is picked. Individuals with these disorders may have vary-\ning degrees of conscious awareness of the behavior while engaging in it, with some indi-\nviduals displaying more focused attention on the behavior (with preceding tension and\nsubsequent relief) and other individuals displaying more automatic behavior (with the be-\nhaviors seeming to occur without full awareness).\nSubstance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder consists of\nsymptoms that are due to substance intoxication or withdrawal or to a medication. Obses-\nsive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition involves symptoms\ncharacteristic of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders that are the direct pathophysio-\nlogical consequence of a medical disorder. Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related\ndisorder and unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder consist of symptoms\nthat do not meet criteria for a specific obsessive-compulsive and related disorder because of\natypical presentation or uncertain etiology; these categories are also used for other specific\nsyndromes that are not listed in Section II and when insufficient information is available to di-\nagnose the presentation as another obsessive-compulsive and related disorder. Examples of\nspecific syndromes not listed in Section II, and therefore diagnosed as other specified obses-\nsive-compulsive and related disorder or as unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related\ndisorder include body-focused repetitive behavior disorder and obsessional jealousy.\nObsessive-compulsive and related disorders that have a cognitive component have in-\nsight as the basis for specifiers; in each of these disorders, insight ranges from “good or fair\ninsight” to “poor insight” to “absent insight/delusional beliefs” with respect to disorder-\nrelated beliefs. For individuals whose obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symp-\ntoms warrant the “with absent insight/delusional beliefs” specifier, these symptoms\nshould not be diagnosed as a psychotic disorder.\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder\n237\nObsessive-Compulsive DisorderAnxiety disorders.\nRecurrent thoughts, avoidant behaviors, and repetitive requests for\nreassurance can also occur in anxiety disorders. However, the recurrent thoughts that are\npresent in generalized anxiety disorder (i.e., worries) are usually about real-life concerns,\nwhereas the obsessions of OCD usually do not involve real-life concerns and can include\ncontent that is odd, irrational, or of a seemingly magical nature; moreover, compulsions\nare often present and usually linked to the obsessions. Like individuals with OCD, indi-\nviduals with specific phobia can have a fear reaction to specific objects or situations; how-\never, in specific phobia the feared object is usually much more circumscribed, and rituals\nare not present. In social anxiety disorder (social phobia), the feared objects or situations\nare limited to social interactions, and avoidance or reassurance seeking is focused on re-\nducing this social fear.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nOCD can be distinguished from the rumination of major\ndepressive disorder, in which thoughts are usually mood-congruent and not necessarily\nexperienced as intrusive or distressing; moreover, ruminations are not linked to compul-\nsions, as is typical in OCD.\nOther obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nIn body dysmorphic disorder, the\nobsessions and compulsions are limited to concerns about physical appearance; and in\ntrichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), the compulsive behavior is limited to hair pulling\nin the absence of obsessions. Hoarding disorder symptoms focus exclusively on the per-\nsistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, marked distress associated with\ndiscarding items, and excessive accumulation of objects. However, if an individual has ob-\nsessions that are typical of OCD (e.g., concerns about incompleteness or harm), and these\nobsessions lead to compulsive hoarding behaviors (e.g., acquiring all objects in a set to at-\ntain a sense of completeness or not discarding old newspapers because they may contain\ninformation that could prevent harm), a diagnosis of OCD should be given instead.\nEating disorders.\nOCD can be distinguished from anorexia nervosa in that in OCD the\nobsessions and compulsions are not limited to concerns about weight and food.\nTics (in tic disorder) and stereotyped movements.\nA tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent,\nnonrhythmic motor movement or vocalization (e.g., eye blinking, throat clearing). A ste-\nreotyped movement is a repetitive, seemingly driven, nonfunctional motor behavior (e.g.,\nhead banging, body rocking, self-biting). Tics and stereotyped movements are typically\nless complex than compulsions and are not aimed at neutralizing obsessions. However,\ndistinguishing between complex tics and compulsions can be difficult. Whereas compul-\nsions are usually preceded by obsessions, tics are often preceded by premonitory sensory\nurges. Some individuals have symptoms of both OCD and a tic disorder, in which case\nboth diagnoses may be warranted.\nPsychotic disorders.\nSome individuals with OCD have poor insight or even delusional\nOCD beliefs. However, they have obsessions and compulsions (distinguishing their\ncondition from delusional disorder) and do not have other features of schizophrenia or\nschizoaffective disorder (e.g., hallucinations or formal thought disorder).\nOther compulsive-like behaviors.\nCertain behaviors are sometimes described as “com-\npulsive,” including sexual behavior (in the case of paraphilias), gambling (i.e., gambling\n242\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\ndisorder), and substance use (e.g., alcohol use disorder). However, these behaviors differ\nfrom the compulsions of OCD in that the person usually derives pleasure from the activity\nand may wish to resist it only because of its deleterious consequences.\nObsessive-compulsive personality disorder.\nAlthough obsessive-compulsive person-\nality disorder and OCD have similar names, the clinical manifestations of these disorders\nare quite different. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is not characterized by in-\ntrusive thoughts, images, or urges or by repetitive behaviors that are performed in re-\nsponse to these intrusions; instead, it involves an enduring and pervasive maladaptive\npattern of excessive perfectionism and rigid control. If an individual manifests symptoms\nof both OCD and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, both diagnoses can be given.Normal appearance concerns and clearly noticeable physical defects.\nBody dysmor-\nphic disorder differs from normal appearance concerns in being characterized by exces-\n246\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\nsive appearance-related preoccupations and repetitive behaviors that are time-consuming,\nare usually difficult to resist or control, and cause clinically significant distress or impair-\nment in functioning. Physical defects that are clearly noticeable (i.e., not slight) are not\ndiagnosed as body dysmorphic disorder. However, skin picking as a symptom of body\ndysmorphic disorder can cause noticeable skin lesions and scarring; in such cases, body dys-\nmorphic disorder should be diagnosed.\nEating disorders.\nIn an individual with an eating disorder, concerns about being fat are\nconsidered a symptom of the eating disorder rather than body dysmorphic disorder.\nHowever, weight concerns may occur in body dysmorphic disorder. Eating disorders and\nbody dysmorphic disorder can be comorbid, in which case both should be diagnosed.\nOther obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nThe preoccupations and repetitive\nbehaviors of body dysmorphic disorder differ from obsessions and compulsions in OCD\nin that the former focus only on appearance. These disorders have other differences, such\nas poorer insight in body dysmorphic disorder. When skin picking is intended to improve\nthe appearance of perceived skin defects, body dysmorphic disorder, rather than excoria-\ntion (skin-picking) disorder, is diagnosed. When hair removal (plucking, pulling, or other\ntypes of removal) is intended to improve perceived defects in the appearance of facial\nor body hair, body dysmorphic disorder is diagnosed rather than trichotillomania (hair-\npulling disorder).\nIllness anxiety disorder.\nIndividuals with body dysmorphic disorder are not preoccu-\npied with having or acquiring a serious illness and do not have particularly elevated levels\nof somatization.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nThe prominent preoccupation with appearance and exces-\nsive repetitive behaviors in body dysmorphic disorder differentiate it from major de-\npressive disorder. However, major depressive disorder and depressive symptoms are\ncommon in individuals with body dysmorphic disorder, often appearing to be secondary\nto the distress and impairment that body dysmorphic disorder causes. Body dysmorphic\ndisorder should be diagnosed in depressed individuals if diagnostic criteria for body dys-\nmorphic disorder are met.\nAnxiety disorders.\nSocial anxiety and avoidance are common in body dysmorphic dis-\norder. However, unlike social anxiety disorder (social phobia), agoraphobia, and avoidant\npersonality disorder, body dysmorphic disorder includes prominent appearance-related\npreoccupation, which may be delusional, and repetitive behaviors, and the social anxiety\nand avoidance are due to concerns about perceived appearance defects and the belief or\nfear that other people will consider these individuals ugly, ridicule them, or reject them be-\ncause of their physical features. Unlike generalized anxiety disorder, anxiety and worry in\nbody dysmorphic disorder focus on perceived appearance flaws.\nPsychotic disorders.\nMany individuals with body dysmorphic disorder have delu-\nsional appearance beliefs (i.e., complete conviction that their view of their perceived de-\nfects is accurate), which is diagnosed as body dysmorphic disorder, with absent insight/\ndelusional beliefs, not as delusional disorder. Appearance-related ideas or delusions of\nreference are common in body dysmorphic disorder; however, unlike schizophrenia or\nschizoaffective disorder, body dysmorphic disorder involves prominent appearance pre-\noccupations and related repetitive behaviors, and disorganized behavior and other psy-\nchotic symptoms are absent (except for appearance beliefs, which may be delusional).\nOther disorders and symptoms.\nBody dysmorphic disorder should not be diagnosed if\nthe preoccupation is limited to discomfort with or a desire to be rid of one’s primary and/\nor secondary sex characteristics in an individual with gender dysphoria or if the preoccu-\npation focuses on the belief that one emits a foul or offensive body odor as in olfactory\nreference syndrome (which is not a DSM-5 disorder). Body identity integrity disorder\nHoarding Disorder\n247\n(apotemnophilia) (which is not a DSM-5 disorder) involves a desire to have a limb ampu-\ntated to correct an experience of mismatch between a person’s sense of body identity and\nhis or her actual anatomy. However, the concern does not focus on the limb’s appearance,\nas it would in body dysmorphic disorder. Koro, a culturally related disorder that usually\noccurs in epidemics in Southeastern Asia, consists of a fear that the penis (labia, nipples, or\nbreasts in females) is shrinking or retracting and will disappear into the abdomen, often\naccompanied by a belief that death will result. Koro differs from body dysmorphic disor-\nder in several ways, including a focus on death rather than preoccupation with perceived\nugliness. Dysmorphic concern (which is not a DSM-5 disorder) is a much broader construct\nthan, and is not equivalent to, body dysmorphic disorder. It involves symptoms reflecting\nan overconcern with slight or imagined flaws in appearance.Other medical conditions.\nHoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms are\njudged to be a direct consequence of another medical condition (Criterion E), such as trau-\nmatic brain injury, surgical resection for treatment of a tumor or seizure control, cerebro-\nvascular disease, infections of the central nervous system (e.g., herpes simplex encephalitis),\nor neurogenetic conditions such as Prader-Willi syndrome. Damage to the anterior ven-\ntromedial prefrontal and cingulate cortices has been particularly associated with the ex-\ncessive accumulation of objects. In these individuals, the hoarding behavior is not present\nprior to the onset of the brain damage and appears shortly after the brain damage occurs.\nSome of these individuals appear to have little interest in the accumulated items and are\nable to discard them easily or do not care if others discard them, whereas others appear to\nbe very reluctant to discard anything.\nNeurodevelopmental disorders.\nHoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumula-\ntion of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of a neurodevelopmental disorder, such\nas autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).\nSchizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.\nHoarding disorder is not di-\nagnosed if the accumulation of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of delusions or\nnegative symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.\nMajor depressive episode.\nHoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of\nobjects is judged to be a direct consequence of psychomotor retardation, fatigue, or loss of\nenergy during a major depressive episode.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nHoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms\nare judged to be a direct consequence of typical obsessions or compulsions, such as fears\nof contamination, harm, or feelings of incompleteness in obsessive-compulsive disorder\n(OCD). Feelings of incompleteness (e.g., losing one’s identity, or having to document and\npreserve all life experiences) are the most frequent OCD symptoms associated with this\nform of hoarding. The accumulation of objects can also be the result of persistently avoid-\nTrichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)\n251\ning onerous rituals (e.g., not discarding objects in order to avoid endless washing or check-\ning rituals).\nIn OCD, the behavior is generally unwanted and highly distressing, and the individual ex-\nperiences no pleasure or reward from it. Excessive acquisition is usually not present; if exces-\nsive acquisition is present, items are acquired because of a specific obsession (e.g., the need to\nbuy items that have been accidentally touched in order to avoid contaminating other people),\nnot because of a genuine desire to possess the items. Individuals who hoard in the context of\nOCD are also more likely to accumulate bizarre items, such as trash, feces, urine, nails, hair,\nused diapers, or rotten food. Accumulation of such items is very unusual in hoarding disorder.\nWhen severe hoarding appears concurrently with other typical symptoms of OCD but\nis judged to be independent from these symptoms, both hoarding disorder and OCD may\nbe diagnosed.\nNeurocognitive disorders.\nHoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of\nobjects is judged to be a direct consequence of a degenerative disorder, such as neurocog-\nnitive disorder associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration or Alzheimer’s disease.\nTypically, onset of the accumulating behavior is gradual and follows onset of the neuro-\ncognitive disorder. The accumulating behavior may be accompanied by self-neglect and\nsevere domestic squalor, alongside other neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as disinhibi-\ntion, gambling, rituals/stereotypies, tics, and self-injurious behaviors.Normative hair removal/manipulation.\nTrichotillomania should not be diagnosed when\nhair removal is performed solely for cosmetic reasons (i.e., to improve one’s physical ap-\npearance). Many individuals twist and play with their hair, but this behavior does not usu-\nally qualify for a diagnosis of trichotillomania. Some individuals may bite rather than pull\nhair; again, this does not qualify for a diagnosis of trichotillomania.\nOther obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nIndividuals with OCD and sym-\nmetry concerns may pull out hairs as part of their symmetry rituals, and individuals with\nbody dysmorphic disorder may remove body hair that they perceive as ugly, asymmetri-\ncal, or abnormal; in such cases a diagnosis of trichotillomania is not given. The description\nof body-focused repetitive behavior disorder in other specified obsessive-compulsive and\nrelated disorder excludes individuals who meet diagnostic criteria for trichotillomania.\n254\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\nNeurodevelopmental disorders.\nIn neurodevelopmental disorders, hair pulling may\nmeet the definition of stereotypies (e.g., in stereotypic movement disorder). Tics (in tic dis-\norders) rarely lead to hair pulling.\nPsychotic disorder.\nIndividuals with a psychotic disorder may remove hair in response\nto a delusion or hallucination. Trichotillomania is not diagnosed in such cases.\nAnother medical condition.\nTrichotillomania is not diagnosed if the hair pulling or hair\nloss is attributable to another medical condition (e.g., inflammation of the skin or other der-\nmatological conditions). Other causes of scarring alopecia (e.g., alopecia areata, androgenic\nalopecia, telogen effluvium) or nonscarring alopecia (e.g., chronic discoid lupus erythema-\ntosus, lichen planopilaris, central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, pseudopelade, folliculitis\ndecalvans, dissecting folliculitis, acne keloidalis nuchae) should be considered in individu-\nals with hair loss who deny hair pulling. Skin biopsy or dermoscopy can be used to differ-\nentiate individuals with trichotillomania from those with dermatological disorders.\nSubstance-related disorders.\nHair-pulling symptoms may be exacerbated by certain\nsubstances—for example, stimulants—but it is less likely that substances are the primary\ncause of persistent hair pulling.Psychotic disorder.\nSkin picking may occur in response to a delusion (i.e., parasitosis)\nor tactile hallucination (i.e., formication) in a psychotic disorder. In such cases, excoriation\ndisorder should not be diagnosed.\nOther obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nExcessive washing compulsions\nin response to contamination obsessions in individuals with OCD may lead to skin lesions,\nand skin picking may occur in individuals with body dysmorphic disorder who pick their\nskin solely because of appearance concerns; in such cases, excoriation disorder should not\nbe diagnosed. The description of body-focused repetitive behavior disorder in other spec-\nified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder excludes individuals whose symptoms\nmeet diagnostic criteria for excoriation disorder.\nNeurodevelopmental disorders.\nWhile stereotypic movement disorder may be charac-\nterized by repetitive self-injurious behavior, onset is in the early developmental period.\nFor example, individuals with the neurogenetic condition Prader-Willi syndrome may\nhave early onset of skin picking, and their symptoms may meet criteria for stereotypic\nmovement disorder. While tics in individuals with Tourette’s disorder may lead to self-\ninjury, the behavior is not tic-like in excoriation disorder.\nSomatic symptom and related disorders.\nExcoriation disorder is not diagnosed if the\nskin lesion is primarily attributable to deceptive behaviors in factitious disorder.\nOther disorders.\nExcoriation disorder is not diagnosed if the skin picking is primarily\nattributable to the intention to harm oneself that is characteristic of nonsuicidal self-injury.\nOther medical conditions.\nExcoriation disorder is not diagnosed if the skin picking is\nprimarily attributable to another medical condition. For example, scabies is a dermatolog-\nical condition invariably associated with severe itching and scratching. However, excori-\nation disorder may be precipitated or exacerbated by an underlying dermatological\ncondition. For example, acne may lead to some scratching and picking, which may also be\nassociated with comorbid excoriation disorder. The differentiation between these two\nclinical situations (acne with some scratching and picking vs. acne with comorbid excori-\nation disorder) requires an assessment of the extent to which the individual’s skin picking\nhas become independent of the underlying dermatological condition.\nSubstance/medication-induced disorders.\nSkin-picking symptoms may also be induced\nby certain substances (e.g., cocaine), in which case excoriation disorder should not be di-\nagnosed. If such skin picking is clinically significant, then a diagnosis of substance/med-\nication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder should be considered.\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder\n257Substance intoxication.\nObsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms may oc-\ncur in substance intoxication. The diagnosis of the substance-specific intoxication will usu-\n260\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\nally suffice to categorize the symptom presentation. A diagnosis of an obsessive-compulsive\nand related disorder should be made in addition to substance intoxication when the symp-\ntoms are judged to be in excess of those usually associated with intoxication and are suf-\nficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.\nObsessive-compulsive and related disorder (i.e., not induced by a substance).\nSub-\nstance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder is judged to be\netiologically related to the substance/medication. Substance/medication-induced obses-\nsive-compulsive and related disorder is distinguished from a primary obsessive-compul-\nsive and related disorder by considering the onset, course, and other factors with respect\nto substances/medications. For drugs of abuse, there must be evidence from the history,\nphysical examination, or laboratory findings for use or intoxication. Substance/medica-\ntion-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder arises only in association with in-\ntoxication, whereas a primary obsessive-compulsive and related disorder may precede the\nonset of substance/medication use. The presence of features that are atypical of a primary\nobsessive-compulsive and related disorder, such as atypical age at onset of symptoms,\nmay suggest a substance-induced etiology. A primary obsessive-compulsive and related\ndisorder diagnosis is warranted if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time\n(about 1 month or longer) after the end of the substance intoxication or the individual has\na history of an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder.\nObsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition.\nIf the\nobsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms are attributable to another medical\ncondition (i.e., rather than to the medication taken for the other medical condition), obses-\nsive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition should be diag-\nnosed. The history often provides the basis for judgment. At times, a change in the\ntreatment for the other medical condition (e.g., medication substitution or discontinua-\ntion) may be needed to determine whether or not the medication is the causative agent (in\nwhich case the symptoms may be better explained by substance/medication-induced ob-\nsessive-compulsive and related disorder). If the disturbance is attributable to both another\nmedical condition and substance use, both diagnoses (i.e., obsessive-compulsive and related\ndisorder due to another medical condition and substance/medication-induced obsessive-\ncompulsive and related disorder) may be given. When there is insufficient evidence to de-\ntermine whether the symptoms are attributable to either a substance/medication or an-\nother medical condition or are primary (i.e., attributable to neither a substance/medication\nnor another medical condition), a diagnosis of other specified or unspecified obsessive-\ncompulsive and related disorder would be indicated.\nDelirium.\nIf obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms occur exclusively\nduring the course of delirium, they are considered to be an associated feature of the delir-\nium and are not diagnosed separately.\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder\nDue to Another Medical ConditionDelirium.\nA separate diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to an-\nother medical condition is not given if the disturbance occurs exclusively during the\ncourse of a delirium. However, a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder\ndue to another medical condition may be given in addition to a diagnosis of major neuro-\ncognitive disorder (dementia) if the etiology of the obsessive-compulsive symptoms is\njudged to be a physiological consequence of the pathological process causing the dementia\nand if obsessive-compulsive symptoms are a prominent part of the clinical presentation.\nMixed presentation of symptoms (e.g., mood and obsessive-compulsive and related\ndisorder symptoms).\nIf the presentation includes a mix of different types of symptoms,\nthe specific mental disorder due to another medical condition depends on which symp-\ntoms predominate in the clinical picture.\nSubstance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nIf there\nis evidence of recent or prolonged substance use (including medications with psychoac-\ntive effects), withdrawal from a substance, or exposure to a toxin, a substance/medication-\ninduced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder should be considered. When a sub-\nstance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder is being diag-\nnosed in relation to drugs of abuse, it may be useful to obtain a urine or blood drug screen\nOther Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder\n263\nor other appropriate laboratory evaluation. Symptoms that occur during or shortly after\n(i.e., within 4 weeks of) substance intoxication or withdrawal or after medication use may\nbe especially indicative of a substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and re-\nlated disorder, depending on the type, duration, or amount of the substance used.\nObsessive-compulsive and related disorders (primary).\nObsessive-compulsive and re-\nlated disorder due to another medical condition should be distinguished from a primary\nobsessive-compulsive and related disorder. In primary mental disorders, no specific and\ndirect causative physiological mechanisms associated with a medical condition can be\ndemonstrated. Late age at onset or atypical symptoms suggest the need for a thorough as-\nsessment to rule out the diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to an-\nother medical condition.\nIllness anxiety disorder.\nIllness anxiety disorder is characterized by a preoccupation with\nhaving or acquiring a serious illness. In the case of illness anxiety disorder, individuals\nmay or may not have diagnosed medical conditions.\nAssociated feature of another mental disorder.\nObsessive-compulsive and related symp-\ntoms may be an associated feature of another mental disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, an-\norexia nervosa).\nOther specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder or unspecified obsessive-\ncompulsive and related disorder.\nThese diagnoses are given if it is unclear whether the\nobsessive-compulsive and related symptoms are primary, substance-induced, or due to\nanother medical condition.\nOther Specified Obsessive-Compulsive\nand Related Disorder\n300.3 (F42)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an obsessive-\ncompulsive and related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in\nsocial, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet\nthe full criteria for any of the disorders in the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders\ndiagnostic class. The other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder category\nis used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that\nthe presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific obsessive-compulsive and re-\nlated disorder. This is done by recording “other specified obsessive-compulsive and relat-\ned disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “body-focused repetitive behavior\ndisorder”).\nExamples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation\ninclude the following:\n1. Body dysmorphic–like disorder with actual flaws: This is similar to body dysmor-\nphic disorder except that the defects or flaws in physical appearance are clearly ob-\nservable by others (i.e., they are more noticeable than “slight”). In such cases, the\npreoccupation with these flaws is clearly excessive and causes significant impairment\nor distress.\n2. Body dysmorphic–like disorder without repetitive behaviors: Presentations that\nmeet body dysmorphic disorder except that the individual has not performed repetitive\nbehaviors or mental acts in response to the appearance concerns.\n3. Body-focused repetitive behavior disorder: This is characterized by recurrent body-\nfocused repetitive behaviors (e.g., nail biting, lip biting, cheek chewing) and repeated\nattempts to decrease or stop the behaviors. These symptoms cause clinically significant\n264\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\ndistress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning\nand are not better explained by trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), excoriation (skin-\npicking) disorder, stereotypic movement disorder, or nonsuicidal self-injury.\n4. Obsessional jealousy: This is characterized by nondelusional preoccupation with a\npartner’s perceived infidelity. The preoccupations may lead to repetitive behaviors or\nmental acts in response to the infidelity concerns; they cause clinically significant dis-\ntress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning; and\nthey are not better explained by another mental disorder such as delusional disorder,\njealous type, or paranoid personality disorder.\n5. Shubo-kyofu: A variant of taijin kyofusho (see “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Dis-\ntress” in the Appendix) that is similar to body dysmorphic disorder and is characterized\nby excessive fear of having a bodily deformity.\n6. Koro: Related to dhat syndrome (see “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in\nthe Appendix), an episode of sudden and intense anxiety that the penis (or the vulva\nand nipples in females) will recede into the body, possibly leading to death.\n7. Jikoshu-kyofu: A variant of taijin kyofusho (see “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Dis-\ntress” in the Appendix) characterized by fear of having an offensive body odor (also\ntermed olfactory reference syndrome).\nUnspecified Obsessive-Compulsive\nand Related Disorder\n300.3 (F42)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an obsessive-\ncompulsive and related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in\nsocial, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet\nthe full criteria for any of the disorders in the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders\ndiagnostic class. The unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder category is\nused in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria\nare not met for a specific obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, and includes presen-\ntations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in\nemergency room settings).\n265\nTrauma- and\nStressor-Related Disorders\nTrauma- and stressor-related disorders include disorders in which exposure to\na traumatic or stressful event is listed explicitly as a diagnostic criterion. These include reactive\nattachment disorder, disinhibited social engagement disorder, posttraumatic stress disor-\nder (PTSD), acute stress disorder, and adjustment disorders. Placement of this chapter reflects\nthe close relationship between these diagnoses and disorders in the surrounding chapters on\nanxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, and dissociative disorders.\nPsychological distress following exposure to a traumatic or stressful event is quite vari-\nable. In some cases, symptoms can be well understood within an anxiety- or fear-based\ncontext. It is clear, however, that many individuals who have been exposed to a traumatic\nor stressful event exhibit a phenotype in which, rather than anxiety- or fear-based symp-\ntoms, the most prominent clinical characteristics are anhedonic and dysphoric symptoms,\nexternalizing angry and aggressive symptoms, or dissociative symptoms. Because of these\nvariable expressions of clinical distress following exposure to catastrophic or aversive\nevents, the aforementioned disorders have been grouped under a separate category:\ntrauma- and stressor-related disorders. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for the clinical pic-\nture to include some combination of the above symptoms (with or without anxiety- or\nfear-based symptoms). Such a heterogeneous picture has long been recognized in adjust-\nment disorders, as well. Social neglect—that is, the absence of adequate caregiving during\nchildhood—is a diagnostic requirement of both reactive attachment disorder and disin-\nhibited social engagement disorder. Although the two disorders share a common etiology,\nthe former is expressed as an internalizing disorder with depressive symptoms and with-\ndrawn behavior, while the latter is marked by disinhibition and externalizing behavior.\nReactive Attachment DisorderAutism spectrum disorder.\nAberrant social behaviors manifest in young children with\nreactive attachment disorder, but they also are key features of autism spectrum disorder.\nSpecifically, young children with either condition can manifest dampened expression of\npositive emotions, cognitive and language delays, and impairments in social reciprocity.\nAs a result, reactive attachment disorder must be differentiated from autism spectrum dis-\norder. These two disorders can be distinguished based on differential histories of neglect\nand on the presence of restricted interests or ritualized behaviors, specific deficit in social\ncommunication, and selective attachment behaviors. Children with reactive attachment\ndisorder have experienced a history of severe social neglect, although it is not always pos-\nsible to obtain detailed histories about the precise nature of their experiences, especially in\ninitial evaluations. Children with autistic spectrum disorder will only rarely have a history\nof social neglect. The restricted interests and repetitive behaviors characteristic of autism\nspectrum disorder are not a feature of reactive attachment disorder. These clinical features\nmanifest as excessive adherence to rituals and routines; restricted, fixated interests; and\nunusual sensory reactions. However, it is important to note that children with either con-\ndition can exhibit stereotypic behaviors such as rocking or flapping. Children with either\ndisorder also may exhibit a range of intellectual functioning, but only children with autis-\n268\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\ntic spectrum disorder exhibit selective impairments in social communicative behaviors,\nsuch as intentional communication (i.e., impairment in communication that is deliberate,\ngoal-directed, and aimed at influencing the behavior of the recipient). Children with reac-\ntive attachment disorder show social communicative functioning comparable to their\noverall level of intellectual functioning. Finally, children with autistic spectrum disorder\nregularly show attachment behavior typical for their developmental level. In contrast,\nchildren with reactive attachment disorder do so only rarely or inconsistently, if at all.\nIntellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).\nDevelopmental delays of-\nten accompany reactive attachment disorder, but they should not be confused with the\ndisorder. Children with intellectual disability should exhibit social and emotional skills\ncomparable to their cognitive skills and do not demonstrate the profound reduction in\npositive affect and emotion regulation difficulties evident in children with reactive attach-\nment disorder. In addition, developmentally delayed children who have reached a cogni-\ntive age of 7–9 months should demonstrate selective attachments regardless of their\nchronological age. In contrast, children with reactive attachment disorder show lack of\npreferred attachment despite having attained a developmental age of at least 9 months.\nDepressive disorders.\nDepression in young children is also associated with reductions\nin positive affect. There is limited evidence, however, to suggest that children with depres-\nsive disorders have impairments in attachment. That is, young children who have been di-\nagnosed with depressive disorders still should seek and respond to comforting efforts by\ncaregivers.Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nBecause of social impulsivity that sometimes\naccompanies attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), it is necessary to differ-\nentiate the two disorders. Children with disinhibited social engagement disorder may be\ndistinguished from those with ADHD because the former do not show difficulties with at-\ntention or hyperactivity.Adjustment disorders.\nIn adjustment disorders, the stressor can be of any severity or\ntype rather than that required by PTSD Criterion A. The diagnosis of an adjustment dis-\norder is used when the response to a stressor that meets PTSD Criterion A does not meet\nall other PTSD criteria (or criteria for another mental disorder). An adjustment disorder is\nalso diagnosed when the symptom pattern of PTSD occurs in response to a stressor that\ndoes not meet PTSD Criterion A (e.g., spouse leaving, being fired).\nOther posttraumatic disorders and conditions.\nNot all psychopathology that occurs in\nindividuals exposed to an extreme stressor should necessarily be attributed to PTSD. The\ndiagnosis requires that trauma exposure precede the onset or exacerbation of pertinent\nsymptoms. Moreover, if the symptom response pattern to the extreme stressor meets cri-\nteria for another mental disorder, these diagnoses should be given instead of, or in addi-\ntion to, PTSD. Other diagnoses and conditions are excluded if they are better explained by\nPTSD (e.g., symptoms of panic disorder that occur only after exposure to traumatic re-\nminders). If severe, symptom response patterns to the extreme stressor may warrant a sep-\narate diagnosis (e.g., dissociative amnesia).\nAcute stress disorder.\nAcute stress disorder is distinguished from PTSD because the\nsymptom pattern in acute stress disorder is restricted to a duration of 3 days to 1 month\nfollowing exposure to the traumatic event.\nAnxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nIn OCD, there are recurrent\nintrusive thoughts, but these meet the definition of an obsession. In addition, the intrusive\nthoughts are not related to an experienced traumatic event, compulsions are usually pres-\nent, and other symptoms of PTSD or acute stress disorder are typically absent. Neither the\narousal and dissociative symptoms of panic disorder nor the avoidance, irritability, and\nanxiety of generalized anxiety disorder are associated with a specific traumatic event. The\nsymptoms of separation anxiety disorder are clearly related to separation from home or\nfamily, rather than to a traumatic event.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nMajor depression may or may not be preceded by a trau-\nmatic event and should be diagnosed if other PTSD symptoms are absent. Specifically, ma-\njor depressive disorder does not include any PTSD Criterion B or C symptoms. Nor does it\ninclude a number of symptoms from PTSD Criterion D or E.\nPersonality disorders.\nInterpersonal difficulties that had their onset, or were greatly ex-\nacerbated, after exposure to a traumatic event may be an indication of PTSD, rather than a\npersonality disorder, in which such difficulties would be expected independently of any\ntraumatic exposure.\nDissociative disorders.\nDissociative amnesia, dissociative identity disorder, and de-\npersonalization-derealization disorder may or may not be preceded by exposure to a trau-\nmatic event or may or may not have co-occurring PTSD symptoms. When full PTSD criteria\nare also met, however, the PTSD “with dissociative symptoms” subtype should be considered.\nConversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).\nNew onset of somatic\nsymptoms within the context of posttraumatic distress might be an indication of PTSD\nrather than conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).\nPsychotic disorders.\nFlashbacks in PTSD must be distinguished from illusions, halluci-\nnations, and other perceptual disturbances that may occur in schizophrenia, brief psy-\nchotic disorder, and other psychotic disorders; depressive and bipolar disorders with\n280\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\npsychotic features; delirium; substance/medication-induced disorders; and psychotic dis-\norders due to another medical condition.\nTraumatic brain injury.\nWhen a brain injury occurs in the context of a traumatic event (e.g.,\ntraumatic accident, bomb blast, acceleration/deceleration trauma), symptoms of PTSD may\nappear. An event causing head trauma may also constitute a psychological traumatic event,\nand tramautic brain injury (TBI)–related neurocognitive symptoms are not mutually exclusive\nand may occur concurrently. Symptoms previously termed postconcussive (e.g., headaches,\ndizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, irritability, concentration deficits) can occur in brain-\ninjured and non-brain-injured populations, including individuals with PTSD. Because symp-\ntoms of PTSD and TBI-related neurocognitive symptoms can overlap, a differential diagnosis\nbetween PTSD and neurocognitive disorder symptoms attributable to TBI may be possible\nbased on the presence of symptoms that are distinctive to each presentation. Whereas reexpe-\nriencing and avoidance are characteristic of PTSD and not the effects of TBI, persistent disori-\nentation and confusion are more specific to TBI (neurocognitive effects) than to PTSD.Adjustment disorders.\nIn acute stress disorder, the stressor can be of any severity rather\nthan of the severity and type required by Criterion A of acute stress disorder. The diagnosis of\nan adjustment disorder is used when the response to a Criterion A event does not meet the cri-\nteria for acute stress disorder (or another specific mental disorder) and when the symptom pat-\ntern of acute stress disorder occurs in response to a stressor that does not meet Criterion A for\nexposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence (e.g., spouse leaving,\nbeing fired). For example, severe stress reactions to life-threatening illnesses that may include\nsome acute stress disorder symptoms may be more appropriately described as an adjustment\ndisorder. Some forms of acute stress response do not include acute stress disorder symptoms\nand may be characterized by anger, depression, or guilt. These responses are more appro-\npriately described as primarily an adjustment disorder. Depressive or anger responses in an\nadjustment disorder may involve rumination about the traumatic event, as opposed to invol-\nuntary and intrusive distressing memories in acute stress disorder.\nPanic disorder.\nSpontaneous panic attacks are very common in acute stress disorder.\nHowever, panic disorder is diagnosed only if panic attacks are unexpected and there is\nanxiety about future attacks or maladaptive changes in behavior associated with fear of\ndire consequences of the attacks.\n286\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\nDissociative disorders.\nSevere dissociative responses (in the absence of characteristic\nacute stress disorder symptoms) may be diagnosed as derealization/depersonalization\ndisorder. If severe amnesia of the trauma persists in the absence of characteristic acute\nstress disorder symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative amnesia may be indicated.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder.\nAcute stress disorder is distinguished from PTSD because\nthe symptom pattern in acute stress disorder must occur within 1 month of the traumatic event\nand resolve within that 1-month period. If the symptoms persist for more than 1 month and\nmeet criteria for PTSD, the diagnosis is changed from acute stress disorder to PTSD.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nIn obsessive-compulsive disorder, there are recurrent\nintrusive thoughts, but these meet the definition of an obsession. In addition, the intrusive\nthoughts are not related to an experienced traumatic event, compulsions are usually pres-\nent, and other symptoms of acute stress disorder are typically absent.\nPsychotic disorders.\nFlashbacks in acute stress disorder must be distinguished from il-\nlusions, hallucinations, and other perceptual disturbances that may occur in schizophre-\nnia, other psychotic disorders, depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, a\ndelirium, substance/medication-induced disorders, and psychotic disorders due to an-\nother medical condition. Acute stress disorder flashbacks are distinguished from these\nother perceptual disturbances by being directly related to the traumatic experience and by\noccurring in the absence of other psychotic or substance-induced features.\nTraumatic brain injury.\nWhen a brain injury occurs in the context of a traumatic event\n(e.g., traumatic accident, bomb blast, acceleration/deceleration trauma), symptoms of\nacute stress disorder may appear. An event causing head trauma may also constitute a\npsychological traumatic event, and tramautic brain injury (TBI)–related neurocognitive\nsymptoms are not mutually exclusive and may occur concurrently. Symptoms previously\ntermed postconcussive (e.g., headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, irritability,\nconcentration deficits) can occur in brain-injured and non–brain injured populations, in-\ncluding individuals with acute stress disorder. Because symptoms of acute stress disorder\nand TBI-related neurocognitive symptoms can overlap, a differential diagnosis between\nacute stress disorder and neurocognitive disorder symptoms attributable to TBI may be\npossible based on the presence of symptoms that are distinctive to each presenta-\ntion. Whereas reexperiencing and avoidance are characteristic of acute stress disorder and\nnot the effects of TBI, persistent disorientation and confusion are more specific to TBI (neu-\nrocognitive effects) than to acute stress disorder. Furthermore, differential is aided by the\nfact that symptoms of acute stress disorder persist for up to only 1 month following trauma\nexposure.\nAdjustment DisordersMajor depressive disorder.\nIf an individual has symptoms that meet criteria for a major\ndepressive disorder in response to a stressor, the diagnosis of an adjustment disorder is\nnot applicable. The symptom profile of major depressive disorder differentiates it from ad-\njustment disorders.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder.\nIn adjustment disorders, the\nstressor can be of any severity rather than of the severity and type required by Criterion A\nof acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In distinguishing ad-\njustment disorders from these two posttraumatic diagnoses, there are both timing and\nsymptom profile considerations. Adjustment disorders can be diagnosed immediately\nand persist up to 6 months after exposure to the traumatic event, whereas acute stress dis-\norder can only occur between 3 days and 1 month of exposure to the stressor, and PTSD\ncannot be diagnosed until at least 1 month has passed since the occurrence of the traumatic\nstressor. The required symptom profile for PTSD and acute stress disorder differentiates\nthem from the adjustment disorders. With regard to symptom profiles, an adjustment dis-\norder may be diagnosed following a traumatic event when an individual exhibits symptoms\nof either acute stress disorder or PTSD that do not meet or exceed the diagnostic threshold\nfor either disorder. An adjustment disorder should also be diagnosed for individuals who\nhave not been exposed to a traumatic event but who otherwise exhibit the full symptom pro-\nfile of either acute stress disorder or PTSD.\nPersonality disorders.\nWith regard to personality disorders, some personality features\nmay be associated with a vulnerability to situational distress that may resemble an adjust-\nment disorder. The lifetime history of personality functioning will help inform the in-\nterpretation of distressed behaviors to aid in distinguishing a long-standing personality\ndisorder from an adjustment disorder. In addition to some personality disorders incurring\nvulnerability to distress, stressors may also exacerbate personality disorder symptoms. In\nthe presence of a personality disorder, if the symptom criteria for an adjustment disorder\nare met, and the stress-related disturbance exceeds what may be attributable to maladap-\ntive personality disorder symptoms (i.e., Criterion C is met), then the diagnosis of an ad-\njustment disorder should be made.\nOther Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder\n289\nPsychological factors affecting other medical conditions.\nIn psychological factors af-\nfecting other medical conditions, specific psychological entities (e.g., psychological symp-\ntoms, behaviors, other factors) exacerbate a medical condition. These psychological\nfactors can precipitate, exacerbate, or put an individual at risk for medical illness, or they\ncan worsen an existing condition. In contrast, an adjustment disorder is a reaction to the\nstressor (e.g., having a medical illness).\nNormative stress reactions.\nWhen bad things happen, most people get upset. This is\nnot an adjustment disorder. The diagnosis should only be made when the magnitude of\nthe distress (e.g., alterations in mood, anxiety, or conduct) exceeds what would normally\nbe expected (which may vary in different cultures) or when the adverse event precipitates\nfunctional impairment.Other specified dissociative disorder.\nThe core of dissociative identity disorder is the\ndivision of identity, with recurrent disruption of conscious functioning and sense of self.\nThis central feature is shared with one form of other specified dissociative disorder, which\nmay be distinguished from dissociative identity disorder by the presence of chronic or re-\ncurrent mixed dissociative symptoms that do not meet Criterion A for dissociative identity\ndisorder or are not accompanied by recurrent amnesia.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nIndividuals with dissociative identity disorder are often de-\npressed, and their symptoms may appear to meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.\nRigorous assessment indicates that this depression in some cases does not meet full criteria for\nmajor depressive disorder. Other specified depressive disorder in individuals with dissocia-\ntive identity disorder often has an important feature: the depressed mood and cognitions fluc-\ntuate because they are experienced in some identity states but not others.\nBipolar disorders.\nIndividuals with dissociative identity disorder are often misdiag-\nnosed with a bipolar disorder, most often bipolar II disorder. The relatively rapid shifts in\nmood in individuals with this disorder—typically within minutes or hours, in contrast to\nthe slower mood changes typically seen in individuals with bipolar disorders—are due to\nthe rapid, subjective shifts in mood commonly reported across dissociative states, some-\ntimes accompanied by fluctuation in levels of activation. Furthermore, in dissociative\nidentity disorder, elevated or depressed mood may be displayed in conjunction with overt\nidentities, so one or the other mood may predominate for a relatively long period of time\n(often for days) or may shift within minutes.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder.\nSome traumatized individuals have both posttraumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD) and dissociative identity disorder. Accordingly, it is crucial to dis-\ntinguish between individuals with PTSD only and individuals who have both PTSD and\ndissociative identity disorder. This differential diagnosis requires that the clinician estab-\nlish the presence or absence of dissociative symptoms that are not characteristic of acute\nstress disorder or PTSD. Some individuals with PTSD manifest dissociative symptoms that\nalso occur in dissociative identity disorder: 1) amnesia for some aspects of trauma, 2) dis-\nsociative flashbacks (i.e., reliving of the trauma, with reduced awareness of one’s current\norientation), and 3) symptoms of intrusion and avoidance, negative alterations in cogni-\ntion and mood, and hyperarousal that are focused around the traumatic event. On the other\nhand, individuals with dissociative identity disorder manifest dissociative symptoms that\nare not a manifestation of PTSD: 1) amnesias for many everyday (i.e., nontraumatic) events,\n2) dissociative flashbacks that may be followed by amnesia for the content of the flashback,\n3) disruptive intrusions (unrelated to traumatic material) by dissociated identity states\ninto the individual’s sense of self and agency, and 4) infrequent, full-blown changes\namong different identity states.\nPsychotic disorders.\nDissociative identity disorder may be confused with schizophre-\nnia or other psychotic disorders. The personified, internally communicative inner voices\nof dissociative identity disorder, especially of a child (e.g., “I hear a little girl crying in a\ncloset and an angry man yelling at her”), may be mistaken for psychotic hallucinations.\nDissociative experiences of identity fragmentation or possession, and of perceived loss of\ncontrol over thoughts, feelings, impulses, and acts, may be confused with signs of formal\nthought disorder, such as thought insertion or withdrawal. Individuals with dissociative\nidentity disorder may also report visual, tactile, olfactory, gustatory, and somatic halluci-\nnations, which are usually related to posttraumatic and dissociative factors, such as partial\nDissociative Identity Disorder\n297\nflashbacks. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder experience these symptoms as\ncaused by alternate identities, do not have delusional explanations for the phenomena,\nand often describe the symptoms in a personified way (e.g., “I feel like someone else wants\nto cry with my eyes”). Persecutory and derogatory internal voices in dissociative identity\ndisorder associated with depressive symptoms may be misdiagnosed as major depression\nwith psychotic features. Chaotic identity change and acute intrusions that disrupt thought\nprocesses may be distinguished from brief psychotic disorder by the predominance of dis-\nsociative symptoms and amnesia for the episode, and diagnostic evaluation after cessation\nof the crisis can help confirm the diagnosis.\nSubstance/medication-induced disorders.\nSymptoms associated with the physiological\neffects of a substance can be distinguished from dissociative identity disorder if the sub-\nstance in question is judged to be etiologically related to the disturbance.\nPersonality disorders.\nIndividuals with dissociative identity disorder often present identi-\nties that appear to encapsulate a variety of severe personality disorder features, suggesting ahowever, the individual’s longitudinal variability in personality style (due to inconsistency\namong identities) differs from the pervasive and persistent dysfunction in affect management\nand interpersonal relationships typical of those with personality disorders.\nConversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).\nThis disorder may be\ndistinguished from dissociative identity disorder by the absence of an identity disruption\ncharacterized by two or more distinct personality states or an experience of possession.\nDissociative amnesia in conversion disorder is more limited and circumscribed (e.g., am-\nnesia for a non-epileptic seizure).\nSeizure disorders.\nIndividuals with dissociative identity disorder may present with sei-\nzurelike symptoms and behaviors that resemble complex partial seizures with temporal\nlobe foci. These include déjà vu, jamais vu, depersonalization, derealization, out-of-body\nexperiences, amnesia, disruptions of consciousness, hallucinations, and other intrusion\nphenomena of sensation, affect, and thought. Normal electroencephalographic findings,\nincluding telemetry, differentiate non-epileptic seizures from the seizurelike symptoms of\ndissociative identity disorder. Also, individuals with dissociative identity disorder obtain\nvery high dissociation scores, whereas individuals with complex partial seizures do not.\nFactitious disorder and malingering.\nIndividuals who feign dissociative identity disor-\nder do not report the subtle symptoms of intrusion characteristic of the disorder; instead\nthey tend to overreport well-publicized symptoms of the disorder, such as dissociative\namnesia, while underreporting less-publicized comorbid symptoms, such as depression.\nIndividuals who feign dissociative identity disorder tend to be relatively undisturbed by\nor may even seem to enjoy “having” the disorder. In contrast, individuals with genuine\ndissociative identity disorder tend to be ashamed of and overwhelmed by their symptoms\nand to underreport their symptoms or deny their condition. Sequential observation, cor-\nroborating history, and intensive psychometric and psychological assessment may be\nhelpful in assessment.\nIndividuals who malinger dissociative identity disorder usually create limited, stereo-\ntyped alternate identities, with feigned amnesia, related to the events for which gain is\nsought. For example, they may present an “all-good” identity and an “all-bad” identity in\nhopes of gaining exculpation for a crime.Dissociative identity disorder.\nIndividuals with dissociative amnesia may report de-\npersonalization and auto-hypnotic symptoms. Individuals with dissociative identity dis-\norder report pervasive discontinuities in sense of self and agency, accompanied by many\nother dissociative symptoms. The amnesias of individuals with localized, selective, and/\nor systematized dissociative amnesias are relatively stable. Amnesias in dissociative iden-\ntity disorder include amnesia for everyday events, finding of unexplained possessions,\nsudden fluctuations in skills and knowledge, major gaps in recall of life history, and brief\namnesic gaps in interpersonal interactions.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder.\nSome individuals with PTSD cannot recall part or all of\na specific traumatic event (e.g., a rape victim with depersonalization and/or derealization\nsymptoms who cannot recall most events for the entire day of the rape). When that amne-\nsia extends beyond the immediate time of the trauma, a comorbid diagnosis of dissociative\namnesia is warranted.\nNeurocognitive disorders.\nIn neurocognitive disorders, memory loss for personal infor-\nmation is usually embedded in cognitive, linguistic, affective, attentional, and behavioral\nDissociative Amnesia\n301\ndisturbances. In dissociative amnesia, memory deficits are primarily for autobiographical\ninformation; intellectual and cognitive abilities are preserved.\nSubstance-related disorders.\nIn the context of repeated intoxication with alcohol or\nother substances/medications, there may be episodes of “black outs” or periods for which the\nindividual has no memory. To aid in distinguishing these episodes from dissociative am-\nnesia, a longitudinal history noting that the amnestic episodes occur only in the context of\nintoxication and do not occur in other situations would help identify the source as sub-\nstance-induced; however the distinction may be difficult when the individual with dis-\nsociative amnesia may also misuse alcohol or other substances in the context of stressful\nsituations that may also exacerbate dissociative symptoms. Some individuals with comor-\nbid dissociative amnesia and substance use disorders will attribute their memory prob-\nlems solely to the substance use. Prolonged use of alcohol or other substances may result in\na substance-induced neurocognitive disorder that may be associated with impaired cog-\nnitive function, but in this context the protracted history of substance use and the persis-\ntent deficits associated with the neurocognitive disorder would serve to distinguish it\nfrom dissociative amnesia, where there is typically no evidence of persistent impairment in\nintellectual functioning.\nPosttraumatic amnesia due to brain injury.\nAmnesia may occur in the context of a trau-\nmatic brain injury (TBI) when there has been an impact to the head or other mechanisms of\nrapid movement or displacement of the brain within the skull TBI. Other characteristics of\nTBI include loss of consciousness, disorientation and confusion, or, in more severe cases,\nneurological signs (e.g., abnormalities on neuroimaging, a new onset of seizures or a marked\nworsening of a preexisting seizure disorder, visual field cuts, anosmia). A neurocognitive\ndisorder attributable to TBI must present either immediately after brain injury occurs or im-\nmediately after the individual recovers consciousness after the injury, and persist past the\nacute post-injury period. The cognitive presentation of a neurocognitive disorder following\nTBI is variable and includes difficulties in the domains of complex attention, executive func-\ntion, learning and memory as well as slowed speed of information processing and distur-\nbances in social cognition. These additional features help distinguish it from dissociative\namnesia.\nSeizure disorders.\nIndividuals with seizure disorders may exhibit complex behavior dur-\ning seizures or post-ictally with subsequent amnesia. Some individuals with a seizure disorder\nengage in nonpurposive wandering that is limited to the period of seizure activity. Con-\nversely, behavior during a dissociative fugue is usually purposeful, complex, and goal-\ndirected and may last for days, weeks, or longer. Occasionally, individuals with a seizure dis-\norder will report that earlier autobiographical memories have been “wiped out” as the seizure\ndisorder progresses. Such memory loss is not associated with traumatic circumstances and ap-\npears to occur randomly. Serial electroencephalograms usually show abnormalities. Telemet-\nric electroencephalographic monitoring usually shows an association between the episodes of\namnesia and seizure activity. Dissociative and epileptic amnesias may coexist.\nCatatonic stupor.\nMutism in catatonic stupor may suggest dissociative amnesia, but fail-\nure of recall is absent. Other catatonic symptoms (e.g., rigidity, posturing, negativism) are\nusually present.\nFactitious disorder and malingering.\nThere is no test, battery of tests, or set of procedures\nthat invariably distinguishes dissociative amnesia from feigned amnesia. Individuals with\nfactitious disorder or malingering have been noted to continue their deception even during\nhypnotic or barbiturate-facilitated interviews. Feigned amnesia is more common in individ-\nuals with 1) acute, florid dissociative amnesia; 2) financial, sexual, or legal problems; or 3) a\nwish to escape stressful circumstances. True amnesia can be associated with those same cir-\ncumstances. Many individuals who malinger confess spontaneously or when confronted.\n302\nDissociative Disorders\nNormal and age-related changes in memory.\nMemory decrements in major and mild\nneurocognitive disorders differ from those of dissociative amnesia, which are usually as-\nsociated with stressful events and are more specific, extensive, and/or complex.Illness anxiety disorder.\nAlthough individuals with depersonalization/derealization dis-\norder can present with vague somatic complaints as well as fears of permanent brain dam-\nage, the diagnosis of depersonalization/derealization disorder is characterized by the\npresence of a constellation of typical depersonalization/derealization symptoms and the ab-\nsence of other manifestations of illness anxiety disorder.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nFeelings of numbness, deadness, apathy, and being in a\ndream are not uncommon in major depressive episodes. However, in depersonalization/\nderealization disorder, such symptoms are associated with further symptoms of the dis-\norder. If the depersonalization/derealization clearly precedes the onset of a major depres-\nsive episode or clearly continues after its resolution, the diagnosis of depersonalization/\nderealization disorder applies.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nSome individuals with depersonalization/dereal-\nization disorder can become obsessively preoccupied with their subjective experience or\ndevelop rituals checking on the status of their symptoms. However, other symptoms of\nobsessive-compulsive disorder unrelated to depersonalization/derealization are not\npresent.\nOther dissociative disorders.\nIn order to diagnose depersonalization/derealization\ndisorder, the symptoms should not occur in the context of another dissociative disorder,\nsuch as dissociative identity disorder. Differentiation from dissociative amnesia and con-\nversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder) is simpler, as the symptoms\nof these disorders do not overlap with those of depersonalization/derealization disorder.\nAnxiety disorders.\nDepersonalization/derealization is one of the symptoms of panic at-\ntacks, increasingly common as panic attack severity increases. Therefore, depersonal-\nization/derealization disorder should not be diagnosed when the symptoms occur only\nduring panic attacks that are part of panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, or specific\nphobia. In addition, it is not uncommon for depersonalization/derealization symptoms\nto first begin in the context of new-onset panic attacks or as panic disorder progresses and\nworsens. In such presentations, the diagnosis of depersonalization/derealization disorder\ncan be made if 1) the depersonalization/derealization component of the presentation is\nvery prominent from the start, clearly exceeding in duration and intensity the occurrence\nof actual panic attacks; or 2) the depersonalization/derealization continues after panic dis-\norder has remitted or has been successfully treated.\nPsychotic disorders.\nThe presence of intact reality testing specifically regarding the\ndepersonalization/derealization symptoms is essential to differentiating depersonal-\nization/derealization disorder from psychotic disorders. Rarely, positive-symptom\nschizophrenia can pose a diagnostic challenge when nihilistic delusions are present. For\nexample, an individual may complain that he or she is dead or the world is not real; this\ncould be either a subjective experience that the individual knows is not true or a delusional\nconviction.\nSubstance/medication-induced disorders.\nDepersonalization/derealization associated\nwith the physiological effects of substances during acute intoxication or withdrawal is not\ndiagnosed as depersonalization/derealization disorder. The most common precipitating\nsubstances are the illicit drugs marijuana, hallucinogens, ketamine, ecstasy, and salvia. In\n306\nDissociative Disorders\nabout 15% of all cases of depersonalization/derealization disorder, the symptoms are pre-\ncipitated by ingestion of such substances. If the symptoms persist for some time in the ab-\nsence of any further substance or medication use, the diagnosis of depersonalization/\nderealization disorder applies. This diagnosis is usually easy to establish since the vast ma-\njority of individuals with this presentation become highly phobic and aversive to the trig-\ngering substance and do not use it again.\nMental disorders due to another medical condition.\nFeatures such as onset after age\n40 years or the presence of atypical symptoms and course in any individual suggest the\npossibility of an underlying medical condition. In such cases, it is essential to conduct a\nthorough medical and neurological evaluation, which may include standard laboratory\nstudies, viral titers, an electroencephalogram, vestibular testing, visual testing, sleep stud-\nies, and/or brain imaging. When the suspicion of an underlying seizure disorder proves\ndifficult to confirm, an ambulatory electroencephalogram may be indicated; although\ntemporal lobe epilepsy is most commonly implicated, parietal and frontal lobe epilepsy\nmay also be associated.If the somatic symptoms are consistent with another mental disorder (e.g., panic disorder),\nand the diagnostic criteria for that disorder are fulfilled, then that mental disorder should\nbe considered as an alternative or additional diagnosis. A separate diagnosis of somatic\nsymptom disorder is not made if the somatic symptoms and related thoughts, feelings, or\nbehaviors occur only during major depressive episodes. If, as commonly occurs, the crite-\nria for both somatic symptom disorder and another mental disorder diagnosis are ful-\nfilled, then both should be coded, as both may require treatment.\nOther medical conditions.\nThe presence of somatic symptoms of unclear etiology is not\nin itself sufficient to make the diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder. The symptoms of\nmany individuals with disorders like irritable bowel syndrome or fibromyalgia would not\nsatisfy the criterion necessary to diagnose somatic symptom disorder (Criterion B). Con-\nversely, the presence of somatic symptoms of an established medical disorder (e.g., diabe-\ntes or heart disease) does not exclude the diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder if the\ncriteria are otherwise met.\nPanic disorder.\nIn panic disorder, somatic symptoms and anxiety about health tend to\noccur in acute episodes, whereas in somatic symptom disorder, anxiety and somatic symp-\ntoms are more persistent.\nGeneralized anxiety disorder.\nIndividuals with generalized anxiety disorder worry about\nmultiple events, situations, or activities, only one of which may involve their health. The\nmain focus is not usually somatic symptoms or fear of illness as it is in somatic symptom\ndisorder.\nDepressive disorders.\nDepressive disorders are commonly accompanied by somatic\nsymptoms. However, depressive disorders are differentiated from somatic symptom dis-\norder by the core depressive symptoms of low (dysphoric) mood and anhedonia.\nIllness anxiety disorder.\nIf the individual has extensive worries about health but no or\nminimal somatic symptoms, it may be more appropriate to consider illness anxiety disorder.\nConversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).\nIn conversion disor-\nder, the presenting symptom is loss of function (e.g., of a limb), whereas in somatic symp-\ntom disorder, the focus is on the distress that particular symptoms cause. The features\nlisted under Criterion B of somatic symptom disorder may be helpful in differentiating the\ntwo disorders.\nDelusional disorder.\nIn somatic symptom disorder, the individual’s beliefs that somatic\nsymptoms might reflect serious underlying physical illness are not held with delusional\nintensity. Nonetheless, the individual’s beliefs concerning the somatic symptoms can be\nfirmly held. In contrast, in delusional disorder, somatic subtype, the somatic symptom be-\nliefs and behavior are stronger than those found in somatic symptom disorder.\nBody dysmorphic disorder.\nIn body dysmorphic disorder, the individual is excessively\nconcerned about, and preoccupied by, a perceived defect in his or her physical features. In\ncontrast, in somatic symptom disorder, the concern about somatic symptoms reflects fear\nof underlying illness, not of a defect in appearance.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nIn somatic symptom disorder, the recurrent ideas about\nsomatic symptoms or illness are less intrusive, and individuals with this disorder do not\nexhibit the associated repetitive behaviors aimed at reducing anxiety that occur in obses-\nsive-compulsive disorder.Other medical conditions.\nThe first differential diagnostic consideration is an underly-\ning medical condition, including neurological or endocrine conditions, occult malignan-\ncies, and other diseases that affect multiple body systems. The presence of a medical\ncondition does not rule out the possibility of coexisting illness anxiety disorder. If a med-\nical condition is present, the health-related anxiety and disease concerns are clearly dis-\nproportionate to its seriousness. Transient preoccupations related to a medical condition\ndo not constitute illness anxiety disorder.\nAdjustment disorders.\nHealth-related anxiety is a normal response to serious illness\nand is not a mental disorder. Such nonpathological health anxiety is clearly related to the\nmedical condition and is typically time-limited. If the health anxiety is severe enough, an\nadjustment disorder may be diagnosed. However, only when the health anxiety is of suf-\nficient duration, severity, and distress can illness anxiety disorder be diagnosed. Thus, the\ndiagnosis requires the continuous persistence of disproportionate health-related anxiety\nfor at least 6 months.\nSomatic symptom disorder.\nSomatic symptom disorder is diagnosed when significant\nsomatic symptoms are present. In contrast, individuals with illness anxiety disorder have\nminimal somatic symptoms and are primarily concerned with the idea they are ill.\nAnxiety disorders.\nIn generalized anxiety disorder, individuals worry about multiple\nevents, situations, or activities, only one of which may involve health. In panic disorder,\nthe individual may be concerned that the panic attacks reflect the presence of a medical ill-\nness; however, although these individuals may have health anxiety, their anxiety is typi-\ncally very acute and episodic. In illness anxiety disorder, the health anxiety and fears are\nmore persistent and enduring. Individuals with illness anxiety disorder may experience\npanic attacks that are triggered by their illness concerns.\nObsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nIndividuals with illness anxiety disor-\nder may have intrusive thoughts about having a disease and also may have associated\ncompulsive behaviors (e.g., seeking reassurance). However, in illness anxiety disorder, the\npreoccupations are usually focused on having a disease, whereas in obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder (OCD), the thoughts are intrusive and are usually focused on fears of getting a\ndisease in the future. Most individuals with OCD have obsessions or compulsions involv-\ning other concerns in addition to fears about contracting disease. In body dysmorphic dis-\n318\nSomatic Symptom and Related Disorders\norder, concerns are limited to the individual’s physical appearance, which is viewed as\ndefective or flawed.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nSome individuals with a major depressive episode rumi-\nnate about their health and worry excessively about illness. A separate diagnosis of illness\nanxiety disorder is not made if these concerns occur only during major depressive epi-\nsodes. However, if excessive illness worry persists after remission of an episode of major\ndepressive disorder, the diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder should be considered.\nPsychotic disorders.\nIndividuals with illness anxiety disorder are not delusional and\ncan acknowledge the possibility that the feared disease is not present. Their ideas do not\nattain the rigidity and intensity seen in the somatic delusions occurring in psychotic dis-\norders (e.g., schizophrenia; delusional disorder, somatic type; major depressive disorder,\nwith psychotic features). True somatic delusions are generally more bizarre (e.g., that an\norgan is rotting or dead) than the concerns seen in illness anxiety disorder. The concerns\nseen in illness anxiety disorder, though not founded in reality, are plausible.If another mental disorder better explains the symptoms, that diagnosis should be made.\nHowever the diagnosis of conversion disorder may be made in the presence of another\nmental disorder.\nNeurological disease.\nThe main differential diagnosis is neurological disease that might\nbetter explain the symptoms. After a thorough neurological assessment, an unexpected\nneurological disease cause for the symptoms is rarely found at follow up. However, reas-\nsessment may be required if the symptoms appear to be progressive. Conversion disorder\nmay coexist with neurological disease.\nSomatic symptom disorder.\nConversion disorder may be diagnosed in addition to so-\nmatic symptom disorder. Most of the somatic symptoms encountered in somatic symptom\ndisorder cannot be demonstrated to be clearly incompatible with pathophysiology (e.g.,\npain, fatigue), whereas in conversion disorder, such incompatibility is required for the di-\nagnosis. The excessive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors characterizing somatic symptom\ndisorder are often absent in conversion disorder.\nFactitious disorder and malingering.\nThe diagnosis of conversion disorder does not re-\nquire the judgment that the symptoms are not intentionally produced (i.e., not feigned),\nbecause assessment of conscious intention is unreliable. However definite evidence of\nfeigning (e.g., clear evidence that loss of function is present during the examination but not\nat home) would suggest a diagnosis of factitious disorder if the individual’s apparent aim\nis to assume the sick role or malingering if the aim is to obtain an incentive such as money.\nDissociative disorders.\nDissociative symptoms are common in individuals with con-\nversion disorder. If both conversion disorder and a dissociative disorder are present, both\ndiagnoses should be made.\nBody dysmorphic disorder.\nIndividuals with body dysmorphic disorder are exces-\nsively concerned about a perceived defect in their physical features but do not complain of\nsymptoms of sensory or motor functioning in the affected body part.\nDepressive disorders.\nIn depressive disorders, individuals may report general heavi-\nness of their limbs, whereas the weakness of conversion disorder is more focal and prom-\ninent. Depressive disorders are also differentiated by the presence of core depressive\nsymptoms.\nPanic disorder.\nEpisodic neurological symptoms (e.g., tremors and paresthesias) can\noccur in both conversion disorder and panic attacks. In panic attacks, the neurological\nsymptoms are typically transient and acutely episodic with characteristic cardiorespira-\ntory symptoms. Loss of awareness with amnesia for the attack and violent limb move-\nments occur in non-epileptic attacks, but not in panic attacks.Mental disorder due to another medical condition.\nA temporal association between\nsymptoms of a mental disorder and those of a medical condition is also characteristic of a\nmental disorder due to another medical condition, but the presumed causality is in the op-\nposite direction. In a mental disorder due to another medical condition, the medical\ncondition is judged to be causing the mental disorder through a direct physiological mech-\nanism. In psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, the psychological or be-\nhavioral factors are judged to affect the course of the medical condition.\nAdjustment disorders.\nAbnormal psychological or behavioral symptoms that develop in\nresponse to a medical condition are more properly coded as an adjustment disorder (a clin-\nically significant psychological response to an identifiable stressor). For example, an indi-\n324\nSomatic Symptom and Related Disorders\nvidual with angina that is precipitated whenever he becomes enraged would be diagnosed\nas having psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, whereas an individual\nwith angina who developed maladaptive anticipatory anxiety would be diagnosed as hav-\ning an adjustment disorder with anxiety. In clinical practice, however, psychological fac-\ntors and a medical condition are often mutually exacerbating (e.g., anxiety as both a\nprecipitant and a consequence of angina), in which case the distinction is arbitrary. Other\nmental disorders frequently result in medical complications, most notably substance use\ndisorders (e.g., alcohol use disorder, tobacco use disorder). If an individual has a coexisting\nmajor mental disorder that adversely affects or causes another medical condition, diagno-\nses of the mental disorder and the medical condition are usually sufficient. Psychological\nfactors affecting other medical conditions is diagnosed when the psychological traits or\nbehaviors do not meet criteria for a mental diagnosis.\nSomatic symptom disorder.\nSomatic symptom disorder is characterized by a combina-\ntion of distressing somatic symptoms and excessive or maladaptive thoughts, feelings,\nand behavior in response to these symptoms or associated health concerns. The individual\nmay or may not have a diagnosable medical condition. In contrast, in psychological factors\naffecting other medical conditions, the psychological factors adversely affect a medical\ncondition; the individual’s thoughts, feelings, and behavior are not necessarily excessive.\nThe difference is one of emphasis, rather than a clear-cut distinction. In psychological fac-\ntors affecting other medical conditions, the emphasis is on the exacerbation of the medical\ncondition (e.g., an individual with angina that is precipitated whenever he becomes anx-\nious). In somatic symptom disorder, the emphasis is on maladaptive thoughts, feelings,\nand behavior (e.g., an individual with angina who worries constantly that she will have a\nheart attack, takes her blood pressure multiple times per day, and restricts her activities).\nIllness anxiety disorder.\nIllness anxiety disorder is characterized by high illness anxiety\nthat is distressing and/or disruptive to daily life with minimal somatic symptoms. The fo-\ncus of clinical concern is the individual’s worry about having a disease; in most cases, no\nserious disease is present. In psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, anx-\niety may be a relevant psychological factor affecting a medical condition, but the clinical\nconcern is the adverse effects on the medical condition.Caregivers who lie about abuse injuries in dependents solely to protect themselves from lia-\nbility are not diagnosed with factitious disorder imposed on another because protection from\nliability is an external reward (Criterion C, the deceptive behavior is evident even in the ab-\nsence of obvious external rewards). Such caregivers who, upon observation, analysis of med-\nical records, and/or interviews with others, are found to lie more extensively than needed for\nimmediate self-protection are diagnosed with factitious disorder imposed on another.\nSomatic symptom disorder.\nIn somatic symptom disorder, there may be excessive at-\ntention and treatment seeking for perceived medical concerns, but there is no evidence that\nthe individual is providing false information or behaving deceptively.\nMalingering.\nMalingering is differentiated from factitious disorder by the intentional re-\nporting of symptoms for personal gain (e.g., money, time off work). In contrast, the diag-\nnosis of factitious disorder requires the absence of obvious rewards.\nConversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).\nConversion disorder\nis characterized by neurological symptoms that are inconsistent with neurological patho-\nphysiology. Factitious disorder with neurological symptoms is distinguished from con-\nversion disorder by evidence of deceptive falsification of symptoms.\nBorderline personality disorder.\nDeliberate physical self-harm in the absence of suicidal\nintent can also occur in association with other mental disorders such as borderline person-\nality disorder. Factitious disorder requires that the induction of injury occur in association\nwith deception.\nMedical condition or mental disorder not associated with intentional symptom falsifi-\ncation.\nPresentation of signs and symptoms of illness that do not conform to an identi-\nfiable medical condition or mental disorder increases the likelihood of the presence of a\nfactitious disorder. However, the diagnosis of factitious disorder does not exclude the\npresence of true medical condition or mental disorder, as comorbid illness often occurs in\nthe individual along with factitious disorder. For example, individuals who might manip-\nulate blood sugar levels to produce symptoms may also have diabetes.\nOther Specified Somatic Symptom and Related Disorder\n327\nOther Specified Somatic Symptom and\nRelated Disorder\n300.89 (F45.8)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a somatic\nsymptom and related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in so-\ncial, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the\nfull criteria for any of the disorders in the somatic symptom and related disorders diagnos-\ntic class.\nExamples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation\ninclude the following:\n1. Brief somatic symptom disorder: Duration of symptoms is less than 6 months.\n2. Brief illness anxiety disorder: Duration of symptoms is less than 6 months.\n3. Illness anxiety disorder without excessive health-related behaviors: Criterion D\nfor illness anxiety disorder is not met.\n4. Pseudocyesis: A false belief of being pregnant that is associated with objective signs\nand reported symptoms of pregnancy.\nUnspecified Somatic Symptom and\nRelated Disorder\n300.82 (F45.9)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a somatic\nsymptom and related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in so-\ncial, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the\nfull criteria for any of the disorders in the somatic symptom and related disorders diagnos-\ntic class. The unspecified somatic symptom and related disorder category should not be\nused unless there are decidedly unusual situations where there is insufficient information\nto make a more specific diagnosis.\nThis page intentionally left blank\n329\nFeeding and\nEating Disorders\nFeeding and eating disorders are characterized by a persistent disturbance of eat-\ning or eating-related behavior that results in the altered consumption or absorption of\nfood and that significantly impairs physical health or psychosocial functioning. Diagnos-\ntic criteria are provided for pica, rumination disorder, avoidant/restrictive food intake\ndisorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder.\nThe diagnostic criteria for rumination disorder, avoidant/restrictive food intake dis-\norder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder result in a classifica-\ntion scheme that is mutually exclusive, so that during a single episode, only one of these\ndiagnoses can be assigned. The rationale for this approach is that, despite a number of\ncommon psychological and behavioral features, the disorders differ substantially in clin-\nical course, outcome, and treatment needs. A diagnosis of pica, however, may be assigned\nin the presence of any other feeding and eating disorder.\nSome individuals with disorders described in this chapter report eating-related symp-\ntoms resembling those typically endorsed by individuals with substance use disorders,\nsuch as craving and patterns of compulsive use. This resemblance may reflect the involve-\nment of the same neural systems, including those implicated in regulatory self-control and\nreward, in both groups of disorders. However, the relative contributions of shared and\ndistinct factors in the development and perpetuation of eating and substance use disor-\nders remain insufficiently understood.\nFinally, obesity is not included in DSM-5 as a mental disorder. Obesity (excess body fat)\nresults from the long-term excess of energy intake relative to energy expenditure. A range\nof genetic, physiological, behavioral, and environmental factors that vary across individ-\nuals contributes to the development of obesity; thus, obesity is not considered a mental\ndisorder. However, there are robust associations between obesity and a number of mental\ndisorders (e.g., binge-eating disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia).\nThe side effects of some psychotropic medications contribute importantly to the develop-\nment of obesity, and obesity may be a risk factor for the development of some mental dis-\norders (e.g., depressive disorders).\nPicaEating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances may occur during the course of other mental\ndisorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia) and in Kleine-Levin syndrome.\nIn any such instance, an additional diagnosis of pica should be given only if the eating be-\nhavior is sufficiently persistent and severe to warrant additional clinical attention.\nAnorexia nervosa.\nPica can usually be distinguished from the other feeding and eating\ndisorders by the consumption of nonnutritive, nonfood substances. It is important to note,\nhowever, that some presentations of anorexia nervosa include ingestion of nonnutritive,\nnonfood substances, such as paper tissues, as a means of attempting to control appetite. In\nsuch cases, when the eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances is primarily used as a\nmeans of weight control, anorexia nervosa should be the primary diagnosis.\nFactitious disorder.\nSome individuals with factitious disorder may intentionally ingest\nforeign objects as part of the pattern of falsification of physical symptoms. In such in-\nstances, there is an element of deception that is consistent with deliberate induction of in-\njury or disease.\nNonsuicidal self-injury and nonsuicidal self-injury behaviors in personality disorders.\nSome individuals may swallow potentially harmful items (e.g., pins, needles, knives) in\nthe context of maladaptive behavior patterns associated with personality disorders or\nnonsuicidal self-injury.Gastrointestinal conditions.\nIt is important to differentiate regurgitation in rumination\ndisorder from other conditions characterized by gastroesophageal reflux or vomiting. Con-\nditions such as gastroparesis, pyloric stenosis, hiatal hernia, and Sandifer syndrome in in-\nfants should be ruled out by appropriate physical examinations and laboratory tests.\nAnorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.\nIndividuals with anorexia nervosa and bulimia\nnervosa may also engage in regurgitation with subsequent spitting out of food as a means\nof disposing of ingested calories because of concerns about weight gain.Appetite loss preceding restricted intake is a nonspecific symptom that can accompany a\nnumber of mental diagnoses. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder can be diagnosed\nconcurrently with the disorders below if all criteria are met, and the eating disturbance re-\nquires specific clinical attention.\nOther medical conditions (e.g., gastrointestinal disease, food allergies and intoler-\nances, occult malignancies).\nRestriction of food intake may occur in other medical condi-\nAvoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder\n337\ntions, especially those with ongoing symptoms such as vomiting, loss of appetite, nausea, ab-\ndominal pain, or diarrhea. A diagnosis of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder requires\nthat the disturbance of intake is beyond that directly accounted for by physical symptoms con-\nsistent with a medical condition; the eating disturbance may also persist after being triggered\nby a medical condition and following resolution of the medical condition.\nUnderlying medical or comorbid mental conditions may complicate feeding and eating.\nBecause older individuals, postsurgical patients, and individuals receiving chemotherapy\noften lose their appetite, an additional diagnosis of avoidant/restrictive food intake dis-\norder requires that the eating disturbance is a primary focus for intervention.\nSpecific neurological/neuromuscular, structural, or congenital disorders and condi-\ntions associated with feeding difficulties.\nFeeding difficulties are common in a number\nof congenital and neurological conditions often related to problems with oral/esophageal/\npharyngeal structure and function, such as hypotonia of musculature, tongue protrusion,\nand unsafe swallowing. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder can be diagnosed in in-\ndividuals with such presentations as long as all diagnostic criteria are met.\nReactive attachment disorder.\nSome degree of withdrawal is characteristic of reactive\nattachment disorder and can lead to a disturbance in the caregiver-child relationship that\ncan affect feeding and the child’s intake. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should\nbe diagnosed concurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and the feeding\ndisturbance is a primary focus for intervention.\nAutism spectrum disorder.\nIndividuals with autism spectrum disorder often present with\nrigid eating behaviors and heightened sensory sensitivities. However, these features do\nnot always result in the level of impairment that would be required for a diagnosis of\navoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should\nbe diagnosed concurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and when the eat-\ning disturbance requires specific treatment.\nSpecific phobia, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), and other anxiety disorders.\nSpecific phobia, other type, specifies “situations that may lead to choking or vomiting” and\ncan represent the primary trigger for the fear, anxiety, or avoidance required for diagnosis.\nDistinguishing specific phobia from avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder can be dif-\nficult when a fear of choking or vomiting has resulted in food avoidance. Although avoid-\nance or restriction of food intake secondary to a pronounced fear of choking or vomiting\ncan be conceptualized as specific phobia, in situations when the eating problem becomes\nthe primary focus of clinical attention, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder becomes\nthe appropriate diagnosis. In social anxiety disorder, the individual may present with a\nfear of being observed by others while eating, which can also occur in avoidant/restrictive\nfood intake disorder.\nAnorexia nervosa.\nRestriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to sig-\nnificantly low body weight is a core feature of anorexia nervosa. However, individuals\nwith anorexia nervosa also display a fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persis-\ntent behavior that interferes with weight gain, as well as specific disturbances in relation to\nperception and experience of their own body weight and shape. These features are not\npresent in avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, and the two disorders should not be\ndiagnosed concurrently. Differential diagnosis between avoidant/restrictive food intake\ndisorder and anorexia nervosa may be difficult, especially in late childhood and early ad-\nolescence, because these disorders may share a number of common symptoms (e.g., food\navoidance, low weight). Differential diagnosis is also potentially difficult in individuals\nwith anorexia nervosa who deny any fear of fatness but nonetheless engage in persistent\nbehaviors that prevent weight gain and who do not recognize the medical seriousness of\ntheir low weight—a presentation sometimes termed “non-fat phobic anorexia nervosa.”\nFull consideration of symptoms, course, and family history is advised, and diagnosis may\n338\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\nbe best made in the context of a clinical relationship over time. In some individuals, avoid-\nant/restrictive food intake disorder might precede the onset of anorexia nervosa.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nIndividuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder may\npresent with avoidance or restriction of intake in relation to preoccupations with food or\nritualized eating behavior. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should be diagnosed\nconcurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and when the aberrant eating is\na major aspect of the clinical presentation requiring specific intervention.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nIn major depressive disorder, appetite might be affected to\nsuch an extent that individuals present with significantly restricted food intake, usually in\nrelation to overall energy intake and often associated with weight loss. Usually appetite\nloss and related reduction of intake abate with resolution of mood problems. Avoidant/\nrestrictive food intake disorder should only be used concurrently if full criteria are met for\nboth disorders and when the eating disturbance requires specific treatment.\nSchizophrenia spectrum disorders.\nIndividuals with schizophrenia, delusional disor-\nder, or other psychotic disorders may exhibit odd eating behaviors, avoidance of specific\nfoods because of delusional beliefs, or other manifestations of avoidant or restrictive in-\ntake. In some cases, delusional beliefs may contribute to a concern about negative conse-\nquences of ingesting certain foods. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should be\nused concurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and when the eating dis-\nturbance requires specific treatment.\nFactitious disorder or factitious disorder imposed on another.\nAvoidant/restrictive\nfood intake disorder should be differentiated from factitious disorder or factitious disor-\nder imposed on another. In order to assume the sick role, some individuals with factitious\ndisorder may intentionally describe diets that are much more restrictive than those they\nare actually able to consume, as well as complications of such behavior, such as a need for\nenteral feedings or nutritional supplements, an inability to tolerate a normal range of\nfoods, and/or an inability to participate normally in age-appropriate situations involving\nfood. The presentation may be impressively dramatic and engaging, and the symptoms re-\nported inconsistently. In factitious disorder imposed on another, the caregiver describes\nsymptoms consistent with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder and may induce\nphysical symptoms such as failure to gain weight. As with any diagnosis of factitious dis-\norder imposed on another, the caregiver receives the diagnosis rather than the affected in-\ndividual, and diagnosis should be made only on the basis of a careful, comprehensive\nassessment of the affected individual, the caregiver, and their interaction.Other possible causes of either significantly low body weight or significant weight loss\nshould be considered in the differential diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, especially when the\npresenting features are atypical (e.g., onset after age 40 years).\nMedical conditions (e.g., gastrointestinal disease, hyperthyroidism, occult malignan-\ncies, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]).\nSerious weight loss may oc-\ncur in medical conditions, but individuals with these disorders usually do not also mani-\nfest a disturbance in the way their body weight or shape is experienced or an intense fear\nof weight gain or persist in behaviors that interfere with appropriate weight gain. Acute\nweight loss associated with a medical condition can occasionally be followed by the onset\nor recurrence of anorexia nervosa, which can initially be masked by the comorbid medical\ncondition. Rarely, anorexia nervosa develops after bariatric surgery for obesity.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nIn major depressive disorder, severe weight loss may occur,\nbut most individuals with major depressive disorder do not have either a desire for exces-\nsive weight loss or an intense fear of gaining weight.\nSchizophrenia.\nIndividuals with schizophrenia may exhibit odd eating behavior and oc-\ncasionally experience significant weight loss, but they rarely show the fear of gaining\nweight and the body image disturbance required for a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa.\nSubstance use disorders.\nIndividuals with substance use disorders may experience low\nweight due to poor nutritional intake but generally do not fear gaining weight and do not\nmanifest body image disturbance. Individuals who abuse substances that reduce appetite\n(e.g., cocaine, stimulants) and who also endorse fear of weight gain should be carefully\nevaluated for the possibility of comorbid anorexia nervosa, given that the substance use\nmay represent a persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain (Criterion B).\nSocial anxiety disorder (social phobia), obsessive-compulsive disorder, and body dys-\nmorphic disorder.\nSome of the features of anorexia nervosa overlap with the criteria for\nsocial phobia, OCD, and body dysmorphic disorder. Specifically, individuals may feel hu-\nmiliated or embarrassed to be seen eating in public, as in social phobia; may exhibit obses-\nsions and compulsions related to food, as in OCD; or may be preoccupied with an imagined\ndefect in bodily appearance, as in body dysmorphic disorder. If the individual with anorexia\nnervosa has social fears that are limited to eating behavior alone, the diagnosis of social pho-\nbia should not be made, but social fears unrelated to eating behavior (e.g., excessive fear of\nspeaking in public) may warrant an additional diagnosis of social phobia. Similarly, an ad-\nditional diagnosis of OCD should be considered only if the individual exhibits obsessions\nand compulsions unrelated to food (e.g., an excessive fear of contamination), and an addi-\ntional diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder should be considered only if the distortion is\nunrelated to body shape and size (e.g., preoccupation that one’s nose is too big).\nBulimia nervosa.\nIndividuals with bulimia nervosa exhibit recurrent episodes of binge\neating, engage in inappropriate behavior to avoid weight gain (e.g., self-induced vomit-\ning), and are overly concerned with body shape and weight. However, unlike individuals\nwith anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type, individuals with bulimia nervosa main-\ntain body weight at or above a minimally normal level.\nAvoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.\nIndividuals with this disorder may exhibit\nsignificant weight loss or significant nutritional deficiency, but they do not have a fear of\ngaining weight or of becoming fat, nor do they have a disturbance in the way they expe-\nrience their body shape and weight.Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type.\nIndividuals whose binge-eating behav-\nior occurs only during episodes of anorexia nervosa are given the diagnosis anorexia ner-\nvosa, binge-eating/purging type, and should not be given the additional diagnosis of\nbulimia nervosa. For individuals with an initial diagnosis of anorexia nervosa who binge\nand purge but whose presentation no longer meets the full criteria for anorexia nervosa,\nbinge-eating/purging type (e.g., when weight is normal), a diagnosis of bulimia ner-\nvosa should be given only when all criteria for bulimia nervosa have been met for at least\n3 months.\nBinge-eating disorder.\nSome individuals binge eat but do not engage in regular inap-\npropriate compensatory behaviors. In these cases, the diagnosis of binge-eating disorder\nshould be considered.\nKleine-Levin syndrome.\nIn certain neurological or other medical conditions, such as\nKleine-Levin syndrome, there is disturbed eating behavior, but the characteristic psycho-\nlogical features of bulimia nervosa, such as overconcern with body shape and weight, are\nnot present.\nMajor depressive disorder, with atypical features.\nOvereating is common in major de-\npressive disorder, with atypical features, but individuals with this disorder do not engage\nin inappropriate compensatory behaviors and do not exhibit the excessive concern with\nbody shape and weight characteristic of bulimia nervosa. If criteria for both disorders are\nmet, both diagnoses should be given.\nBorderline personality disorder.\nBinge-eating behavior is included in the impulsive be-\nhavior criterion that is part of the definition of borderline personality disorder. If the cri-\nteria for both borderline personality disorder and bulimia nervosa are met, both diagnoses\nshould be given.Bulimia nervosa.\nBinge-eating disorder has recurrent binge eating in common with bu-\nlimia nervosa but differs from the latter disorder in some fundamental respects. In terms of\nclinical presentation, the recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior (e.g., purging,\ndriven exercise) seen in bulimia nervosa is absent in binge-eating disorder. Unlike in-\ndividuals with bulimia nervosa, individuals with binge-eating disorder typically do not\nshow marked or sustained dietary restriction designed to influence body weight and\nshape between binge-eating episodes. They may, however, report frequent attempts at\ndieting. Binge-eating disorder also differs from bulimia nervosa in terms of response to treat-\nment. Rates of improvement are consistently higher among individuals with binge-eating\ndisorder than among those with bulimia nervosa.\nObesity.\nBinge-eating disorder is associated with overweight and obesity but has\nseveral key features that are distinct from obesity. First, levels of overvaluation of body\nOther Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder\n353\nweight and shape are higher in obese individuals with the disorder than in those without\nthe disorder. Second, rates of psychiatric comorbidity are significantly higher among\nobese individuals with the disorder compared with those without the disorder. Third, the\nlong-term successful outcome of evidence-based psychological treatments for binge-\neating disorder can be contrasted with the absence of effective long-term treatments for\nobesity.\nBipolar and depressive disorders.\nIncreases in appetite and weight gain are included\nin the criteria for major depressive episode and in the atypical features specifiers for de-\npressive and bipolar disorders. Increased eating in the context of a major depressive epi-\nsode may or may not be associated with loss of control. If the full criteria for both disorders\nare met, both diagnoses can be given. Binge eating and other symptoms of disordered eat-\ning are seen in association with bipolar disorder. If the full criteria for both disorders are\nmet, both diagnoses should be given.\nBorderline personality disorder.\nBinge eating is included in the impulsive behavior cri-\nterion that is part of the definition of borderline personality disorder. If the full criteria for\nboth disorders are met, both diagnoses should be given.Neurogenic bladder or another medical condition.\nThe diagnosis of enuresis is not made\nin the presence of a neurogenic bladder or another medical condition that causes polyuria or\nurgency (e.g., untreated diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus) or during an acute urinary\ntract infection. However, a diagnosis is compatible with such conditions if urinary inconti-\nnence was regularly present prior to the development of another medical condition or if it per-\nsists after the institution of appropriate treatment of the medical condition.\nMedication side effects.\nEnuresis may occur during treatment with antipsychotic med-\nications, diuretics, or other medications that may induce incontinence. In this case, the di-\nagnosis should not be made in isolation but may be noted as a medication side effect.\nHowever, a diagnosis of enuresis may be made if urinary incontinence was regularly pres-\nent prior to treatment with the medication.A diagnosis of encopresis in the presence of another medical condition is appropriate only\nif the mechanism involves constipation that cannot be explained by other medical condi-\ntions. Fecal incontinence related to other medical conditions (e.g., chronic diarrhea, spina\nbifida, anal stenosis) would not warrant a DSM-5 diagnosis of encopresis.Normal sleep variations.\nNormal sleep duration varies considerably across individuals.\nSome individuals who require little sleep (“short sleepers”) may be concerned about their\nsleep duration. Short sleepers differ from individuals with insomnia disorder by the lack of\ndifficulty falling or staying asleep and by the absence of characteristic daytime symptoms\n(e.g., fatigue, concentration problems, irritability). However, some short sleepers may desire\nor attempt to sleep for a longer period of time and, by prolonging time in bed, may create an\ninsomnia-like sleep pattern. Clinical insomnia also should be distinguished from normal,\nage-related sleep changes. Insomnia must also be distinguished from sleep deprivation due\nto inadequate opportunity or circumstance for sleep resulting, for example, from an emer-\ngency or from professional or family obligations forcing the individual to stay awake.\nSituational/acute insomnia.\nSituational/acute insomnia is a condition lasting a few days\nto a few weeks, often associated with life events or with changes in sleep schedules. These\nacute or short-term insomnia symptoms may also produce significant distress and inter-\nfere with social, personal, and occupational functioning. When such symptoms are fre-\nquent enough and meet all other criteria except for the 3-month duration, a diagnosis of\nother specified insomnia disorder or unspecified insomnia disorder is made.\nDelayed sleep phase and shift work types of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder.\nIndividuals with the delayed sleep phase type of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder re-\nport sleep-onset insomnia only when they try to sleep at socially normal times, but they do\nnot report difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep when their bed and rising times are\ndelayed and coincide with their endogenous circadian rhythm. Shift work type differs from\ninsomnia disorder by the history of recent shift work.\nRestless legs syndrome.\nRestless legs syndrome often produces difficulties initiating\nand maintaining sleep. However, an urge to move the legs and any accompanying unpleas-\nant leg sensations are features that differentiate this disorder from insomnia disorder.\nBreathing-related sleep disorders.\nMost individuals with a breathing-related sleep dis-\norder have a history of loud snoring, breathing pauses during sleep, and excessive daytime\nsleepiness. Nonetheless, as many as 50% of individuals with sleep apnea may also report\ninsomnia symptoms, a feature that is more common among females and older adults.\nNarcolepsy.\nNarcolepsy may cause insomnia complaints but is distinguished from in-\nsomnia disorder by the predominance of symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, cat-\naplexy, sleep paralysis, and sleep-related hallucinations.\nParasomnias.\nParasomnias are characterized by a complaint of unusual behavior or events\nduring sleep that may lead to intermittent awakenings and difficulty resuming sleep.\nHowever, it is these behavioral events, rather than the insomnia per se, that dominate the\nclinical picture.\n368\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nSubstance/medication-induced sleep disorder, insomnia type.\nSubstance/medication-\ninduced sleep disorder, insomnia type, is distinguished from insomnia disorder by the fact\nthat a substance (i.e., a drug of abuse, a medication, or exposure to a toxin) is judged to be\netiologically related to the insomnia (see “Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disor-\nder” later in this chapter). For example, insomnia occurring only in the context of heavy\ncoffee consumption would be diagnosed as caffeine-induced sleep disorder, insomnia\ntype, with onset during intoxication.Normative variation in sleep.\n“Normal” sleep duration varies considerably in the general\npopulation. “Long sleepers” (i.e., individuals who require a greater than average amount\nof sleep) do not have excessive sleepiness, sleep inertia, or automatic behavior when they\nobtain their required amount of nocturnal sleep. Sleep is reported to be refreshing. If social\nor occupational demands lead to shorter nocturnal sleep, daytime symptoms may appear.\nIn hypersomnolence disorder, by contrast, symptoms of excessive sleepiness occur regard-\nless of nocturnal sleep duration. An inadequate amount of nocturnal sleep, or behaviorally\ninduced insufficient sleep syndrome, can produce symptoms of daytime sleepiness very similar\nto those of hypersomnolence. An average sleep duration of fewer than 7 hours per night\nstrongly suggests inadequate nocturnal sleep, and an average of more than 9–10 hours of\nsleep per 24-hour period suggests hypersomnolence. Individuals with inadequate noctur-\nnal sleep typically “catch up” with longer sleep durations on days when they are free from\nsocial or occupational demands or on vacations. Unlike hypersomnolence, insufficient\nnocturnal sleep is unlikely to persist unabated for decades. A diagnosis of hypersomno-\nlence disorder should not be made if there is a question regarding the adequacy of noctur-\nnal sleep duration. A diagnostic and therapeutic trial of sleep extension for 10–14 days can\noften clarify the diagnosis.\nPoor sleep quality and fatigue.\nHypersomnolence disorder should be distinguished\nfrom excessive sleepiness related to insufficient sleep quantity or quality and fatigue (i.e.,\ntiredness not necessarily relieved by increased sleep and unrelated to sleep quantity or\nquality). Excessive sleepiness and fatigue are difficult to differentiate and may overlap\nconsiderably.\nBreathing-related sleep disorders.\nIndividuals with hypersomnolence and breathing-\nrelated sleep disorders may have similar patterns of excessive sleepiness. Breathing-\n372\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nrelated sleep disorders are suggested by a history of loud snoring, pauses in breathing\nduring sleep, brain injury, or cardiovascular disease and by the presence of obesity, oro-\npharyngeal anatomical abnormalities, hypertension, or heart failure on physical examina-\ntion. Polysomnographic studies can confirm the presence of apneic events in breathing-\nrelated sleep disorder (and their absence in hypersomnolence disorder).\nCircadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders.\nCircadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders are\noften characterized by daytime sleepiness. A history of an abnormal sleep-wake schedule\n(with shifted or irregular hours) is present in individuals with a circadian rhythm sleep-\nwake disorder.\nParasomnias.\nParasomnias rarely produce the prolonged, undisturbed nocturnal sleep\nor daytime sleepiness characteristic of hypersomnolence disorder.\nOther mental disorders.\nHypersomnolence disorder must be distinguished from mental\ndisorders that include hypersomnolence as an essential or associated feature. In particular,\ncomplaints of daytime sleepiness may occur in a major depressive episode, with atypical fea-\ntures, and in the depressed phase of bipolar disorder. Assessment for other mental disorders is\nessential before a diagnosis of hypersomnolence disorder is considered. A diagnosis of hyper-\nsomnolence disorder can be made in the presence of another current or past mental disorder.Other hypersomnias.\nHypersomnolence and narcolepsy are similar with respect to the\ndegree of daytime sleepiness, age at onset, and stable course over time but can be distin-\nNarcolepsy\n377\nguished based on distinctive clinical and laboratory features. Individuals with hypersom-\nnolence typically have longer and less disrupted nocturnal sleep, greater difficulty\nawakening, more persistent daytime sleepiness (as opposed to more discrete “sleep at-\ntacks” in narcolepsy), longer and less refreshing daytime sleep episodes, and little or no\ndreaming during daytime naps. By contrast, individuals with narcolepsy have cataplexy\nand recurrent intrusions of elements of REM sleep into the transition between sleep and\nwakefulness (e.g., sleep-related hallucinations and sleep paralysis). The MSLT typically\ndemonstrates shorter sleep latencies (i.e., greater physiological sleepiness) as well as the\npresence of multiple sleep-onset REM periods in individuals with narcolepsy.\nSleep deprivation and insufficient nocturnal sleep.\nSleep deprivation and insufficient\nnocturnal sleep are common in adolescents and shift workers. In adolescents, difficulties\nfalling asleep at night are common, causing sleep deprivation. The MSLT result may be\npositive if conducted while the individual is sleep deprived or while his or her sleep is\nphase delayed.\nSleep apnea syndromes.\nSleep apneas are especially likely in the presence of obesity.\nBecause obstructive sleep apnea is more frequent than narcolepsy, cataplexy may be over-\nlooked (or absent), and the individual is assumed to have obstructive sleep apnea unre-\nsponsive to usual therapies.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nNarcolepsy or hypersomnia may be associated or confused\nwith depression. Cataplexy is not present in depression. The MSLT results are most often\nnormal, and there is dissociation between subjective and objective sleepiness, as measured\nby the mean sleep latency during the MSLT.\nConversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).\nAtypical features,\nsuch as long-lasting cataplexy or unusual triggers, may be present in conversion disorder\n(functional neurological symptom disorder). Individuals may report sleeping and dream-\ning, yet the MSLT does not show the characteristic sleep-onset REM period. Full-blown,\nlong-lasting pseudocataplexy may occur during consultation, allowing the examining\nphysician enough time to verify reflexes, which remain intact.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or other behavioral problems.\nIn children and\nadolescents, sleepiness can cause behavioral problems, including aggressiveness and in-\nattention, leading to a misdiagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nSeizures.\nIn young children, cataplexy can be misdiagnosed as seizures. Seizures are not\ncommonly triggered by emotions, and when they are, the trigger is not usually laughing or\njoking. During a seizure, individuals are more likely to hurt themselves when falling. Sei-\nzures characterized by isolated atonia are rarely seen in isolation of other seizures, and\nthey also have signatures on the electroencephalogram.\nChorea and movement disorders.\nIn young children, cataplexy can be misdiagnosed as\nchorea or pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal\ninfections, especially in the context of a strep throat infection and high antistreptolysin O\nantibody levels. Some children may have an overlapping movement disorder close to on-\nset of the cataplexy.\nSchizophrenia.\nIn the presence of florid and vivid hypnagogic hallucinations, individuals\nmay think these experiences are real—a feature that suggests schizophrenia. Similarly,\nwith stimulant treatment, persecutory delusions may develop. If cataplexy is present, the\nclinician should first assume that these symptoms are secondary to narcolepsy before con-\nsidering a co-occurring diagnosis of schizophrenia.Primary snoring and other sleep disorders.\nIndividuals with obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea must be differentiated from individuals with primary snoring (i.e., otherwise\n382\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nasymptomatic individuals who snore and do not have abnormalities on overnight polysom-\nnography). Individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea may additionally report\nnocturnal gasping and choking. The presence of sleepiness or other daytime symptoms\nnot explained by other etiologies suggests the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea hypop-\nnea, but this differentiation requires polysomnography. Definitive differential diagnosis\nbetween hypersomnia, central sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoventilation, and obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea also requires polysomnographic studies.\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea must be differentiated from other causes of sleepi-\nness, such as narcolepsy, hypersomnia, and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea can be differentiated from narcolepsy by the absence of cataplexy,\nsleep-related hallucinations, and sleep paralysis and by the presence of loud snoring,\ngasping during sleep, or observed apneas in sleep. Daytime sleep episodes in narcolepsy\nare characteristically shorter, more refreshing, and more often associated with dreaming.\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea shows characteristic apneas and hypopneas and oxy-\ngen desaturation during nocturnal polysomnographic studies. Narcolepsy results in mul-\ntiple sleep-onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods during the MSLT. Narcolepsy, like\nobstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, may be associated with obesity, and some individuals\nhave concurrent narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. A diagnosis of narco-\nlepsy does not exclude the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, as the two con-\nditions may co-occur.\nInsomnia disorder.\nFor individuals complaining of difficulty initiating or maintaining\nsleep or early-morning awakenings, insomnia disorder can be differentiated from obstruc-\ntive sleep apnea hypopnea by the absence of snoring and the absence of the history, signs,\nand symptoms characteristic of the latter disorder. However, insomnia and obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea may coexist, and if so, both disorders may need to be addressed\nconcurrently to improve sleep.\nPanic attacks.\nNocturnal panic attacks may include symptoms of gasping or choking\nduring sleep that may be difficult to distinguish clinically from obstructive sleep apnea hy-\npopnea. However, the lower frequency of episodes, intense autonomic arousal, and lack of\nexcessive sleepiness differentiate nocturnal panic attacks from obstructive sleep apnea hy-\npopnea. Polysomnography in individuals with nocturnal panic attacks does not reveal the\ntypical pattern of apneas or oxygen desaturation characteristic of obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea. Individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea do not provide a history of\ndaytime panic attacks.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in chil-\ndren may include symptoms of inattention, academic impairment, hyperactivity, and in-\nternalizing behaviors, all of which may also be symptoms of childhood obstructive sleep\napnea hypopnea. The presence of other symptoms and signs of childhood obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea (e.g., labored breathing or snoring during sleep and adenotonsillar\nhypertrophy) would suggest the presence of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Obstruc-\ntive sleep apnea hypopnea and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may commonly\nco-occur, and there may be causal links between them; therefore, risk factors such as en-\nlarged tonsils, obesity, or a family history of sleep apnea may help alert the clinician to\ntheir co-occurrence.\nSubstance/medication-induced insomnia or hypersomnia.\nSubstance use and substance\nwithdrawal (including medications) can produce insomnia or hypersomnia. A careful his-\ntory is usually sufficient to identify the relevant substance/medication, and follow-up\nshows improvement of the sleep disturbance after discontinuation of the substance/med-\nication. In other cases, the use of a substance/medication (e.g., alcohol, barbiturates, ben-\nzodiazepines, tobacco) has been shown to exacerbate obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea.\nAn individual with symptoms and signs consistent with obstructive sleep apnea hypop-\nCentral Sleep Apnea\n383\nnea should receive that diagnosis, even in the presence of concurrent substance use that is\nexacerbating the condition.Idiopathic central sleep apnea must be distinguished from other breathing-related sleep\ndisorders, other sleep disorders, and medical conditions and mental disorders that cause\nsleep fragmentation, sleepiness, and fatigue. This is achieved using polysomnography.\nOther breathing-related sleep disorders and sleep disorders.\nCentral sleep apnea can\nbe distinguished from obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea by the presence of at least five\ncentral apneas per hour of sleep. These conditions may co-occur, but central sleep apnea is\nconsidered to predominate when the ratio of central to obstructive respiratory events ex-\nceeds 50%.\nCheyne-Stokes breathing can be distinguished from other mental disorders, including\nother sleep disorders, and other medical conditions that cause sleep fragmentation, sleep-\niness, and fatigue based on the presence of a predisposing condition (e.g., heart failure or\nstroke) and signs and polysomnographic evidence of the characteristic breathing pattern.\nPolysomnographic respiratory findings can help distinguish Cheyne-Stokes breathing\nfrom insomnia due to other medical conditions. High-altitude periodic breathing has a\npattern that resembles Cheyne-Stokes breathing but has a shorter cycle time, occurs only\nat high altitude, and is not associated with heart failure.\nCentral sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use can be differentiated from other types of\nbreathing-related sleep disorders based on the use of long-acting opioid medications in\nconjunction with polysomnographic evidence of central apneas and periodic or ataxic\nbreathing. It can be distinguished from insomnia due to drug or substance use based on\npolysomnographic evidence of central sleep apnea.Other medical conditions affecting ventilation.\nIn adults, the idiopathic variety of sleep-\nrelated hypoventilation is very uncommon and is determined by excluding the presence of\nlung diseases, skeletal malformations, neuromuscular disorders, and other medical and\nneurological disorders or medications that affect ventilation. Sleep-related hypoventila-\ntion must be distinguished from other causes of sleep-related hypoxemia, such as that due\nto lung disease.\nOther breathing-related sleep disorders.\nSleep-related hypoventilation can be distin-\nguished from obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and central sleep apnea based on clinical\nfeatures and findings on polysomnography. Sleep-related hypoventilation typically shows\nmore sustained periods of oxygen desaturation rather that the periodic episodes seen in\nobstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and central sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea hy-\npopnea and central sleep apnea also show a pattern of discrete episodes of repeated air-\nflow decreases that can be absent in sleep-related hypoventilation.Normative variations in sleep.\nDelayed sleep phase type must be distinguished from\n“normal” sleep patterns in which an individual has a late schedule that does not cause\npersonal, social, or occupational distress (most commonly seen in adolescents and young\nadults).\nOther sleep disorders.\nInsomnia disorder and other circadian rhythm sleep-wake dis-\norders should be included in the differential. Excessive sleepiness may also be caused by\nother sleep disturbances, such as breathing-related sleep disorders, insomnias, sleep-\nrelated movement disorders, and medical, neurological, and mental disorders. Overnight\npolysomnography may help in evaluating for other comorbid sleep disorders, such as\nsleep apnea. The circadian nature of delayed sleep phase type, however, should differen-\ntiate it from other disorders with similar complaints.Other sleep disorders.\nBehavioral factors such as irregular sleep schedules, voluntary\nearly awakening, and exposure to light in the early morning should be considered, partic-\nularly in older adults. Careful attention should be paid to rule out other sleep-wake dis-\norders, such as insomnia disorder, and other mental disorders and medical conditions that\ncan cause early morning awakening.\nDepressive and bipolar disorders.\nBecause early morning awakening, fatigue, and sleep-\niness are prominent features of major depressive disorder, depressive and bipolar disor-\nders must also be considered.Normative variations in sleep.\nIrregular sleep-wake type should be distinguished from\na voluntary irregular sleep-wake schedule and poor sleep hygiene, which can result in in-\nsomnia and excessive sleepiness.\nOther medical conditions and mental disorders.\nOther causes of insomnia and daytime\nsleepiness, including comorbid medical conditions and mental disorders or medication,\nshould be considered.\n396\nSleep-Wake DisordersCircadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders.\nIn sighted individuals, non-24-hour sleep-wake\ntype should be differentiated from delayed sleep phase type, as individuals with delayed\nsleep phase type may display a similar progressive delay in sleep period for several days.\nDepressive disorders.\nDepressive symptoms and depressive disorders may result in\nsimilar circadian dysregulation and symptoms.Normative variations in sleep with shift work.\nThe diagnosis of shift work type, as op-\nposed to the “normal” difficulties of shift work, must depend to some extent on the sever-\nity of symptoms and/or level of distress experienced by the individual. Presence of shift\nwork type symptoms even when the individual is able to live on a day-oriented routine for\nseveral weeks at a time may suggest the presence of other sleep disorders, such as sleep ap-\nnea, insomnia, and narcolepsy, which should be ruled out.Nightmare disorder.\nIn contrast to individuals with NREM sleep arousal disorders, in-\ndividuals with nightmare disorder typically awaken easily and completely, report vivid\nstorylike dreams accompanying the episodes, and tend to have episodes later in the night.\nNREM sleep arousal disorders occur during NREM sleep, whereas nightmares usually oc-\ncur during REM sleep. Parents of children with NREM sleep arousal disorders may mis-\ninterpret reports of fragmentary imagery as nightmares.\nBreathing-related sleep disorders.\nBreathing disorders during sleep can also produce\nconfusional arousals with subsequent amnesia. However, breathing-related sleep disor-\nders are also characterized by characteristic symptoms of snoring, breathing pauses, and\nNon–Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal Disorders\n403\ndaytime sleepiness. In some individuals, a breathing-related sleep disorder may precipi-\ntate episodes of sleepwalking.\nREM sleep behavior disorder.\nREM sleep behavior disorder may be difficult to distin-\nguish from NREM sleep arousal disorders. REM sleep behavior disorder is characterized\nby episodes of prominent, complex movements, often involving personal injury arising\nfrom sleep. In contrast to NREM sleep arousal disorders, REM sleep behavior disorder oc-\ncurs during REM sleep. Individuals with REM sleep behavior disorder awaken easily and\nreport more detailed and vivid dream content than do individuals with NREM sleep arousal\ndisorders. They often report that they “act out dreams.”\nParasomnia overlap syndrome.\nParasomnia overlap syndrome consists of clinical and\npolysomnographic features of both sleepwalking and REM sleep behavior disorder.\nSleep-related seizures.\nSome types of seizures can produce episodes of very unusual\nbehaviors that occur predominantly or exclusively during sleep. Nocturnal seizures may\nclosely mimic NREM sleep arousal disorders but tend to be more stereotypic in nature, oc-\ncur multiple times nightly, and be more likely to occur from daytime naps. The presence of\nsleep-related seizures does not preclude the presence of NREM sleep arousal disorders.\nSleep-related seizures should be classified as a form of epilepsy.\nAlcohol-induced blackouts.\nAlcohol-induced blackouts may be associated with extremely\ncomplex behaviors in the absence of other suggestions of intoxication. They do not involve\nthe loss of consciousness but rather reflect an isolated disruption of memory for events\nduring a drinking episode. By history, these behaviors may be indistinguishable from those\nseen in NREM sleep arousal disorders.\nDissociative amnesia, with dissociative fugue.\nDissociative fugue may be extremely\ndifficult to distinguish from sleepwalking. Unlike all other parasomnias, nocturnal disso-\nciative fugue arises from a period of wakefulness during sleep, rather than precipitously\nfrom sleep without intervening wakefulness. A history of recurrent childhood physical or\nsexual abuse is usually present (but may be difficult to obtain).\nMalingering or other voluntary behavior occurring during wakefulness.\nAs with disso-\nciative fugue, malingering or other voluntary behavior occurring during wakefulness\narises from wakefulness.\nPanic disorder.\nPanic attacks may also cause abrupt awakenings from deep NREM sleep\naccompanied by fearfulness, but these episodes produce rapid and complete awakening with-\nout the confusion, amnesia, or motor activity typical of NREM sleep arousal disorders.\nMedication-induced complex behaviors.\nBehaviors similar to those in NREM sleep\narousal disorders can be induced by use of, or withdrawal from, substances or medica-\ntions (e.g., benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics, opiates, cocaine, nic-\notine, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, chloral hydrate). Such behaviors may arise\nfrom the sleep period and may be extremely complex. The underlying pathophysiology\nappears to be a relatively isolated amnesia. In such cases, substance/medication-induced\nsleep disorder, parasomnia type, should be diagnosed (see “Substance/Medication-\nInduced Sleep Disorder” later in this chapter).\nNight eating syndrome.\nThe sleep-related eating disorder form of sleepwalking is to be\ndifferentiated from night eating syndrome, in which there is a delay in the circadian rhythm\nof food ingestion and an association with insomnia and/or depression.Sleep terror disorder.\nBoth nightmare disorder and sleep terror disorder include awak-\nenings or partial awakenings with fearfulness and autonomic activation, but the two dis-\norders are differentiable. Nightmares typically occur later in the night, during REM sleep,\nand produce vivid, storylike, and clearly recalled dreams; mild autonomic arousal; and\ncomplete awakenings. Sleep terrors typically arise in the first third of the night during\nstage 3 or 4 NREM sleep and produce either no dream recall or images without an elabo-\nrate storylike quality. The terrors lead to partial awakenings that leave the individual con-\nfused, disoriented, and only partially responsive and with substantial autonomic arousal.\nThere is usually amnesia for the event in the morning.\nREM sleep behavior disorder.\nThe presence of complex motor activity during fright-\nening dreams should prompt further evaluation for REM sleep behavior disorder, which\noccurs more typically among late middle-age males and, unlike nightmare disorder, is as-\nsociated with often violent dream enactments and a history of nocturnal injuries. The\ndream disturbance of REM sleep behavior disorder is described by patients as nightmares\nbut is controlled by appropriate medication.\nBereavement.\nDysphoric dreams may occur during bereavement but typically involve\nloss and sadness and are followed by self-reflection and insight, rather than distress, on\nawakening.\nNarcolepsy.\nNightmares are a frequent complaint in narcolepsy, but the presence of ex-\ncessive sleepiness and cataplexy differentiates this condition from nightmare disorder.\nNocturnal seizures.\nSeizures may rarely manifest as nightmares and should be evalu-\nated with polysomnography and continuous video electroencephalography. Nocturnal\nseizures usually involve stereotypical motor activity. Associated nightmares, if recalled,\nRapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder\n407\nare often repetitive in nature or reflect epileptogenic features such as the content of diurnal\nauras (e.g., unmotivated dread), phosphenes, or ictal imagery. Disorders of arousal, espe-\ncially confusional arousals, may also be present.\nBreathing-related sleep disorders.\nBreathing-related sleep disorders can lead to awaken-\nings with autonomic arousal, but these are not usually accompanied by recall of nightmares.\nPanic disorder.\nAttacks arising during sleep can produce abrupt awakenings with au-\ntonomic arousal and fearfulness, but nightmares are typically not reported and symptoms\nare similar to panic attacks arising during wakefulness.\nSleep-related dissociative disorders.\nIndividuals may recall actual physical or emo-\ntional trauma as a “dream” during electroencephalography-documented awakenings.\nMedication or substance use.\nNumerous substances/medications can precipitate night-\nmares, including dopaminergics; beta-adrenergic antagonists and other antihypertensives;\namphetamine, cocaine, and other stimulants; antidepressants; smoking cessation aids;\nand melatonin. Withdrawal of REM sleep–suppressant medications (e.g., antidepressants)\nand alcohol can produce REM sleep rebound accompanied by nightmares. If nightmares\nare sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention, a diagnosis of substance/\nmedication-induced sleep disorder should be considered.Other parasomnias.\nConfusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors can easily be\nconfused with REM sleep behavior disorder. In general, these disorders occur in younger\nindividuals. Unlike REM sleep behavior disorder, they arise from deep NREM sleep and\ntherefore tend to occur in the early portion of the sleep period. Awakening from a confu-\nsional arousal is associated with confusion, disorientation, and incomplete recall of dream\nmentation accompanying the behavior. Polysomnographic monitoring in the disorders of\narousal reveals normal REM atonia.\nNocturnal seizures.\nNocturnal seizures may perfectly mimic REM sleep behavior disor-\nder, but the behaviors are generally more stereotyped. Polysomnographic monitoring em-\nploying a full electroencephalographic seizure montage may differentiate the two. REM\nsleep without atonia is not present on polysomnographic monitoring.\n410\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nObstructive sleep apnea.\nObstructive sleep apnea may result in behaviors indistin-\nguishable from REM sleep behavior disorder. Polysomnographic monitoring is necessary\nto differentiate between the two. In this case, the symptoms resolve following effective\ntreatment of the obstructive sleep apnea, and REM sleep without atonia is not present on\npolysomnography monitoring.\nOther specified dissociative disorder (sleep-related psychogenic dissociative disorder).\nUnlike virtually all other parasomnias, which arise precipitously from NREM or REM\nsleep, psychogenic dissociative behaviors arise from a period of well-defined wakefulness\nduring the sleep period. Unlike REM sleep behavior disorder, this condition is more prev-\nalent in young females.\nMalingering.\nMany cases of malingering in which the individual reports problematic\nsleep movements perfectly mimic the clinical features of REM sleep behavior disorder,\nand polysomnographic documentation is mandatory.The most important conditions in the differential diagnosis of RLS are leg cramps, posi-\ntional discomfort, arthralgias/arthritis, myalgias, positional ischemia (numbness), leg\nedema, peripheral neuropathy, radiculopathy, and habitual foot tapping. “Knotting” of\nthe muscle (cramps), relief with a single postural shift, limitation to joints, soreness to pal-\npation (myalgias), and other abnormalities on physical examination are not characteristic\nof RLS. Unlike RLS, nocturnal leg cramps do not typically present with the desire to move\nthe limbs nor are there frequent limb movements. Less common conditions to be differen-\ntiated from RLS include neuroleptic-induced akathisia, myelopathy, symptomatic venous\ninsufficiency, peripheral artery disease, eczema, other orthopedic problems, and anxiety-\ninduced restlessness. Worsening at night and periodic limb movements are more common\nin RLS than in medication-induced akathisia or peripheral neuropathy.\nWhile is it important that RLS symptoms not be solely accounted for by another medical\nor behavioral condition, it should also be appreciated that any of these similar conditions can\noccur in an individual with RLS. This necessitates a separate focus on each possible condi-\ntion in the diagnostic process and when assessing impact. For cases in which the diagnosis of\nRLS is not certain, evaluation for the supportive features of RLS, particularly PLMS or a fam-\nily history of RLS, may be helpful. Clinical features, such as response to a dopaminergic\nagent and positive family history for RLS, can help with the differential diagnosis.Substance intoxication or substance withdrawal. Sleep disturbances are commonly en-\ncountered in the context of substance intoxication or substance discontinuation/with-\ndrawal. A diagnosis of substance/medication-induced sleep disorder should be made\ninstead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the\nsleep disturbance is predominant in the clinical picture and is sufficiently severe to war-\nrant independent clinical attention.\nDelirium.\nIf the substance/medication-induced sleep disturbance occurs exclusively dur-\ning the course of a delirium, it is not diagnosed separately.\nOther sleep disorders.\nA substance/medication-induced sleep disorder is distinguished\nfrom another sleep disorder if a substance/medication is judged to be etiologically related to\nthe symptoms. A substance/medication-induced sleep disorder attributed to a prescribed\nmedication for a mental disorder or medical condition must have its onset while the individual\nis receiving the medication or during discontinuation, if there is a discontinuation/with-\ndrawal syndrome associated with the medication. Once treatment is discontinued, the sleep\ndisturbance will usually remit within days to several weeks. If symptoms persist beyond\n4 weeks, other causes for the sleep disturbance–related symptoms should be considered. Not\ninfrequently, individuals with another sleep disorder use medications or drugs of abuse to\nself-medicate their symptoms (e.g., alcohol for management of insomnia). If the substance/\nmedication is judged to play a significant role in the exacerbation of the sleep disturbance, an\nadditional diagnosis of a substance/medication-induced sleep disorder may be warranted.\nSleep disorder due to another medical condition.\nSubstance/medication-induced sleep\ndisorder and sleep disorder associated with another medical condition may produce sim-\nilar symptoms of insomnia, daytime sleepiness, or a parasomnia. Many individuals with\nother medical conditions that cause sleep disturbance are treated with medications that\nmay also cause sleep disturbances. The chronology of symptoms is the most important fac-\ntor in distinguishing between these two sources of sleep symptoms. Difficulties with sleep\nthat clearly preceded the use of any medication for treatment of a medical condition would\n420\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nsuggest a diagnosis of sleep disorder associated with another medical condition. Con-\nversely, sleep symptoms that appear only after the initiation of a particular medication/\nsubstance suggest a substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. If the disturbance is\ncomorbid with another medical condition and is also exacerbated by substance use, both\ndiagnoses (i.e., sleep disorder associated with another medical condition and substance/\nmedication-induced sleep disorder) are given. When there is insufficient evidence to de-\ntermine whether the sleep disturbance is attributable to a substance/medication or to an-\nother medical condition or is primary (i.e., not due to either a substance/medication or\nanother medical condition), a diagnosis of other specified sleep-wake disorder or unspec-\nified sleep-wake disorder is indicated.Another medical condition.\nThe major differential diagnosis is between delayed ejacu-\nlation fully explained by another medical illness or injury and delayed ejaculation with a\npsychogenic, idiopathic, or combined psychological and medical etiology. A situational\naspect to the complaint is suggestive of a psychological basis for the problem (e.g., men\nwho can ejaculate during sexual activity with one sex but not the other; men who can ejac-\nulate with one partner but not another of the same sex; men with paraphilic arousal pat-\n426\nSexual Dysfunctions\nterns; men who require highly ritualized activity to ejaculate during partnered sexual\nactivity). Another medical illness or injury may produce delays in ejaculation independent\nof psychological issues. For example, inability to ejaculate can be caused by interruption of\nthe nerve supply to the genitals, such as can occur after traumatic surgical injury to the\nlumbar sympathetic ganglia, abdominoperitoneal surgery, or lumbar sympathectomy.\nEjaculation is thought to be under autonomic nervous system control involving the hypo-\ngastric (sympathetic) and pudendal (parasympathetic) nerves. A number of neurodegen-\nerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and diabetic and alcoholic neuropathy, can\ncause inability to ejaculate. Delayed ejaculation should also be differentiated from retro-\ngrade ejaculation (i.e., ejaculation into the bladder), which may follow transurethral pros-\ntatic resection.\nSubstance/medication use.\nA number of pharmacological agents, such as antidepres-\nsants, antipsychotics, alpha sympathetic drugs, and opioid drugs, can cause ejaculatory\nproblems.\nDysfunction with orgasm.\nIt is important in the history to ascertain whether the com-\nplaint concerns delayed ejaculation or the sensation of orgasm, or both. Ejaculation occurs\nin the genitals, whereas the experience of orgasm is believed to be primarily subjective.\nEjaculation and orgasm usually occur together but not always. For example, a man with a\nnormal ejaculatory pattern may complain of decreased pleasure (i.e., anhedonic ejacula-\ntion). Such a complaint would not be coded as delayed ejaculation but could be coded as\nother specified sexual dysfunction or unspecified sexual dysfunction.Nonsexual mental disorders.\nMajor depressive disorder and erectile disorder are closely\nassociated, and erectile disorder accompanying severe depressive disorder may occur.\nNormal erectile function.\nThe differential should include consideration of normal erec-\ntile function in men with excessive expectations.\nFemale Orgasmic Disorder\n429\nSubstance/medication use.\nAnother major differential diagnosis is whether the erectile\nproblem is secondary to substance/medication use. An onset that coincides with the be-\nginning of substance/medication use and that dissipates with discontinuation of the sub-\nstance/medication or dose reduction is suggestive of a substance/medication-induced\nsexual dysfunction.\nAnother medical condition.\nThe most difficult aspect of the differential diagnosis of erec-\ntile disorder is ruling out erectile problems that are fully explained by medical factors. Such\ncases would not receive a diagnosis of a mental disorder. The distinction between erectile\ndisorder as a mental disorder and erectile dysfunction as the result of another medical con-\ndition is usually unclear, and many cases will have complex, interactive biological and psy-\nchiatric etiologies. If the individual is older than 40–50 years and/or has concomitant\nmedical problems, the differential diagnosis should include medical etiologies, especially\nvascular disease. The presence of an organic disease known to cause erectile problems does\nnot confirm a causal relationship. For example, a man with diabetes mellitus can develop\nerectile disorder in response to psychological stress. In general, erectile dysfunction due to\norganic factors is generalized and gradual in onset. An exception would be erectile problems\nafter traumatic injury to the nervous innervation of the genital organs (e.g., spinal cord injury).\nErectile problems that are situational and inconsistent and that have an acute onset after a\nstressful life event are most often due to psychological events. An age of less than 40 years is\nalso suggestive of a psychological etiology to the difficulty.\nOther sexual dysfunctions.\nErectile disorder may coexist with premature (early) ejacu-\nlation and male hypoactive sexual desire disorder.Nonsexual mental disorders.\nNonsexual mental disorders, such as major depressive\ndisorder, which is characterized by markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or al-\nmost all, activities, may explain female orgasmic disorder. If the orgasmic difficulties are\nbetter explained by another mental disorder, then a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder\nwould not be made.\nSubstance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction.\nSubstance/medication use may\nexplain the orgasmic difficulties.\nAnother medical condition.\nIf the disorder is due to another medical condition (e.g.,\nmultiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury), then a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would\nnot be made.\nInterpersonal factors.\nIf interpersonal or significant contextual factors, such as severe\nrelationship distress, intimate partner violence, or other significant stressors, are associ-\nated with the orgasmic difficulties, then a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would\nnot be made.\nOther sexual dysfunctions.\nFemale orgasmic disorder may occur in association with other\nsexual dysfunctions (e.g., female sexual interest/arousal disorder). The presence of another\nsexual dysfunction does not rule out a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder. Occasional or-\ngasmic difficulties that are short-term or infrequent and are not accompanied by clinically sig-\nnificant distress or impairment are not diagnosed as female orgasmic disorder. A diagnosis is\nalso not appropriate if the problems are the result of inadequate sexual stimulation.Nonsexual mental disorders.\nNonsexual mental disorders, such as major depressive\ndisorder, in which there is “markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all,\nactivities most of the day, nearly every day,” may explain the lack of sexual interest/\narousal. If the lack of interest or arousal is completely attributable to another mental dis-\norder, then a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder would not be made.\nSubstance/medication use.\nSubstance or medication use may explain the lack of inter-\nest/arousal.\nAnother medical condition.\nIf the sexual symptoms are considered to be almost exclu-\nsively associated with the effects of another medical condition (e.g., diabetes mellitus, en-\ndothelial disease, thyroid dysfunction, central nervous system disease), then a diagnosis\nof female sexual interest/arousal disorder would not be made.\nInterpersonal factors.\nIf interpersonal or significant contextual factors, such as severe\nrelationship distress, intimate partner violence, or other significant stressors, explain the\nsexual interest/arousal symptoms, then a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal dis-\norder would not be made.\nOther sexual dysfunctions.\nThe presence of another sexual dysfunction does not rule\nout a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder. It is common for women to ex-\nperience more than one sexual dysfunction. For example, the presence of chronic genital\npain may lead to a lack of desire for the (painful) sexual activity. Lack of interest and\narousal during sexual activity may impair orgasmic ability. For some women, all aspects\nof the sexual response may be unsatisfying and distressing.\nInadequate or absent sexual stimuli.\nWhen differential diagnoses are being considered,\nit is important to assess the adequacy of sexual stimuli within the woman’s sexual experi-\nence. In cases where inadequate or absent sexual stimuli are contributing to the clinical pic-\nture, there may be evidence for clinical care, but a sexual dysfunction diagnosis would not\nbe made. Similarly, transient and adaptive alterations in sexual functioning that are second-\nary to a significant life or personal event must be considered in the differential diagnosis.Another medical condition.\nIn many instances, women with genito-pelvic pain/pene-\ntration disorder will also be diagnosed with another medical condition (e.g., lichen scle-\nrosus, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, vulvovaginal atrophy). In some cases,\ntreating the medical condition may alleviate the genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder.\nMuch of the time, this is not the case. There are no reliable tools or diagnostic methods to\nallow clinicians to know whether the medical condition or genito-pelvic pain/penetration\ndisorder is primary. Often, the associated medical conditions are difficult to diagnose and\ntreat. For example, the increased incidence of postmenopausal pain during intercourse\nmay sometimes be attributable to vaginal dryness or vulvovaginal atrophy associated with\ndeclining estrogen levels. The relationship, however, between vulvovaginal atrophy/dry-\nness, estrogen, and pain is not well understood.\nSomatic symptom and related disorders.\nSome women with genito-pelvic pain/pene-\ntration disorder may also be diagnosable with somatic symptom disorder. Since both\ngenito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder and the somatic symptom and related disorders\nare new diagnoses, it is not yet clear whether they can be reliably differentiated. Some\nwomen diagnosed with genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder will also be diagnosed\nwith a specific phobia.\nInadequate sexual stimuli.\nIt is important that the clinician, in considering differential diag-\nnoses, assess the adequacy of sexual stimuli within the woman’s sexual experience. Sexual sit-\nuations in which there is inadequate foreplay or arousal may lead to difficulties in penetration,\npain, or avoidance. Erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation in the male partner may\nresult in difficulties with penetration. These conditions should be carefully assessed. In some\nsituations, a diagnosis of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder may not be appropriate.Nonsexual mental disorders.\nNonsexual mental disorders, such as major depressive\ndisorder, which is characterized by “markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or al-\nmost all, activities,” may explain the lack of sexual desire. If the lack of desire is better\nexplained by another mental disorder, then a diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire\ndisorder would not be made.\nSubstance/medication use.\nSubstance/medication use may explain the lack of sexual\ndesire.\nAnother medical condition.\nIf the low/absent desire and deficient/absent erotic thoughts\nor fantasies are better explained by the effects of another medical condition (e.g., hypogo-\nnadism, diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, central nervous system disease), then a di-\nagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder would not be made.\nInterpersonal factors.\nIf interpersonal or significant contextual factors, such as severe\nrelationship distress or other significant stressors, are associated with the loss of desire in\nthe man, then a diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder would not be made.\nOther sexual dysfunctions.\nThe presence of another sexual dysfunction does not rule out a\ndiagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder; there is some evidence that up to one-half\nof men with low sexual desire also have erectile difficulties, and slightly fewer may also have\nearly ejaculation difficulties. If the man’s low desire is explained by self-identification as an\nasexual, then a diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder is not made.Substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction.\nWhen problems with premature\nejaculation are due exclusively to substance use, intoxication, or withdrawal, substance/\nmedication-induced sexual dysfunction should be diagnosed.\n446\nSexual Dysfunctions\nEjaculatory concerns that do not meet diagnostic criteria.\nIt is necessary to identify\nmales with normal ejaculatory latencies who desire longer ejaculatory latencies and males\nwho have episodic premature (early) ejaculation (e.g., during the first sexual encounter\nwith a new partner when a short ejaculatory latency may be common or normative). Neither\nof these situations would lead to a diagnosis of premature (early) ejaculation, even though\nthese situations may be distressing to some males.Non-substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunctions.\nMany mental conditions, such\nas depressive, bipolar, anxiety, and psychotic disorders, are associated with disturbances\nof sexual function. Thus, differentiating a substance/medication-induced sexual dys-\nfunction from a manifestation of the underlying mental disorder can be quite difficult. The\ndiagnosis is usually established if a close relationship between substance/medication ini-\ntiation or discontinuation is observed. A clear diagnosis can be established if the problem\noccurs after substance/medication initiation, dissipates with substance/medication dis-\ncontinuation, and recurs with introduction of the same agent. Most substance/medication-in-\nduced side effects occur shortly after initiation or discontinuation. Sexual side effects that\nonly occur after chronic use of a substance/medication may be extremely difficult to di-\nagnose with certainty.\nOther Specified Sexual Dysfunction\n302.79 (F52.8)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a sexual dys-\nfunction that cause clinically significant distress in the individual predominate but do not\nmeet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the sexual dysfunctions diagnostic class.\nThe other specified sexual dysfunction category is used in situations in which the clinician\nchooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the cri-\nteria for any specific sexual dysfunction. This is done by recording “other specified sexual\ndysfunction” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “sexual aversion”).\nUnspecified Sexual Dysfunction\n302.70 (F52.9)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a sexual dys-\nfunction that cause clinically significant distress in the individual predominate but do not\nmeet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the sexual dysfunctions diagnostic class.\nThe unspecified sexual dysfunction category is used in situations in which the clinician\nchooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific sexual dys-\nfunction, and includes presentations for which there is insufficient information to make a\nmore specific diagnosis.\n451\nGender\nDysphoria\nIn this chapter, there is one overarching diagnosis of gender dysphoria, with sepa-\nrate developmentally appropriate criteria sets for children and for adolescents and adults.\nThe area of sex and gender is highly controversial and has led to a proliferation of terms\nwhose meanings vary over time and within and between disciplines. An additional source\nof confusion is that in English “sex” connotes both male/female and sexuality. This chapter\nemploys constructs and terms as they are widely used by clinicians from various disci-\nplines with specialization in this area. In this chapter, sex and sexual refer to the biological\nindicators of male and female (understood in the context of reproductive capacity), such\nas in sex chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones, and nonambiguous internal and external\ngenitalia. Disorders of sex development denote conditions of inborn somatic deviations of\nthe reproductive tract from the norm and/or discrepancies among the biological indica-\ntors of male and female. Cross-sex hormone treatment denotes the use of feminizing hor-\nmones in an individual assigned male at birth based on traditional biological indicators or\nthe use of masculinizing hormones in an individual assigned female at birth.\nThe need to introduce the term gender arose with the realization that for individuals\nwith conflicting or ambiguous biological indicators of sex (i.e., “intersex”), the lived role in\nsociety and/or the identification as male or female could not be uniformly associated with\nor predicted from the biological indicators and, later, that some individuals develop an\nidentity as female or male at variance with their uniform set of classical biological indica-\ntors. Thus, gender is used to denote the public (and usually legally recognized) lived role as\nboy or girl, man or woman, but, in contrast to certain social constructionist theories, biolog-\nical factors are seen as contributing, in interaction with social and psychological factors, to\ngender development. Gender assignment refers to the initial assignment as male or female.\nThis occurs usually at birth and, thereby, yields the “natal gender.” Gender-atypical refers to\nsomatic features or behaviors that are not typical (in a statistical sense) of individuals with\nthe same assigned gender in a given society and historical era; for behavior, gender-noncon-\nforming is an alternative descriptive term. Gender reassignment denotes an official (and usu-\nally legal) change of gender. Gender identity is a category of social identity and refers to an\nindividual’s identification as male, female, or, occasionally, some category other than male\nor female. Gender dysphoria as a general descriptive term refers to an individual’s affective/\ncognitive discontent with the assigned gender but is more specifically defined when used\nas a diagnostic category. Transgender refers to the broad spectrum of individuals who tran-\nsiently or persistently identify with a gender different from their natal gender. Transsexual\ndenotes an individual who seeks, or has undergone, a social transition from male to female\nor female to male, which in many, but not all, cases also involves a somatic transition by\ncross-sex hormone treatment and genital surgery (sex reassignment surgery).\nGender dysphoria refers to the distress that may accompany the incongruence between\none’s experienced or expressed gender and one’s assigned gender. Although not all indi-\nviduals will experience distress as a result of such incongruence, many are distressed if the\ndesired physical interventions by means of hormones and/or surgery are not available.\nThe current term is more descriptive than the previous DSM-IV term gender identity disor-\nder and focuses on dysphoria as the clinical problem, not identity per se.\n452\nGender Dysphoria\nGender DysphoriaNonconformity to gender roles.\nGender dysphoria should be distinguished from sim-\nple nonconformity to stereotypical gender role behavior by the strong desire to be of an-\nother gender than the assigned one and by the extent and pervasiveness of gender-variant\nactivities and interests. The diagnosis is not meant to merely describe nonconformity to\nstereotypical gender role behavior (e.g., “tomboyism” in girls, “girly-boy” behavior in\nboys, occasional cross-dressing in adult men). Given the increased openness of atypical\ngender expressions by individuals across the entire range of the transgender spectrum, it\nis important that the clinical diagnosis be limited to those individuals whose distress and\nimpairment meet the specified criteria.\nTransvestic disorder.\nTransvestic disorder occurs in heterosexual (or bisexual) adoles-\ncent and adult males (rarely in females) for whom cross-dressing behavior generates sex-\nual excitement and causes distress and/or impairment without drawing their primary\ngender into question. It is occasionally accompanied by gender dysphoria. An individual\nwith transvestic disorder who also has clinically significant gender dysphoria can be given\nboth diagnoses. In many cases of late-onset gender dysphoria in gynephilic natal males,\ntransvestic behavior with sexual excitement is a precursor.\nBody dysmorphic disorder.\nAn individual with body dysmorphic disorder focuses on\nthe alteration or removal of a specific body part because it is perceived as abnormally formed,\nnot because it represents a repudiated assigned gender. When an individual’s presenta-\ntion meets criteria for both gender dysphoria and body dysmorphic disorder, both diag-\nnoses can be given. Individuals wishing to have a healthy limb amputated (termed by\nsome body integrity identity disorder) because it makes them feel more “complete” usually\ndo not wish to change gender, but rather desire to live as an amputee or a disabled person.\nSchizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.\nIn schizophrenia, there may rarely be\ndelusions of belonging to some other gender. In the absence of psychotic symptoms, in-\nsistence by an individual with gender dysphoria that he or she is of some other gender is\nnot considered a delusion. Schizophrenia (or other psychotic disorders) and gender dys-\nphoria may co-occur.\nOther clinical presentations.\nSome individuals with an emasculinization desire who\ndevelop an alternative, nonmale/nonfemale gender identity do have a presentation that\nmeets criteria for gender dysphoria. However, some males seek castration and/or penec-\ntomy for aesthetic reasons or to remove psychological effects of androgens without chang-\ning male identity; in these cases, the criteria for gender dysphoria are not met.Conduct disorder.\nConduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder are both related\nto conduct problems that bring the individual in conflict with adults and other authority\nfigures (e.g., teachers, work supervisors). The behaviors of oppositional defiant disorder\nare typically of a less severe nature than those of conduct disorder and do not include ag-\ngression toward people or animals, destruction of property, or a pattern of theft or deceit.\nFurthermore, oppositional defiant disorder includes problems of emotional dysregulation\n(i.e., angry and irritable mood) that are not included in the definition of conduct disorder.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nADHD is often comorbid with oppositional de-\nfiant disorder. To make the additional diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder, it is impor-\ntant to determine that the individual’s failure to conform to requests of others is not solely in\nsituations that demand sustained effort and attention or demand that the individual sit still.\nDepressive and bipolar disorders.\nDepressive and bipolar disorders often involve neg-\native affect and irritability. As a result, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder should\nnot be made if the symptoms occur exclusively during the course of a mood disorder.\nDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder.\nOppositional defiant disorder shares with dis-\nruptive mood dysregulation disorder the symptoms of chronic negative mood and temper\noutbursts. However, the severity, frequency, and chronicity of temper outbursts are more\nsevere in individuals with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder than in those with\noppositional defiant disorder. Thus, only a minority of children and adolescents whose\nsymptoms meet criteria for oppositional defiant disorder would also be diagnosed with dis-\nruptive mood dysregulation disorder. When the mood disturbance is severe enough to meet\ncriteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant dis-\norder is not given, even if all criteria for oppositional defiant disorder are met.\nIntermittent explosive disorder.\nIntermittent explosive disorder also involves high\nrates of anger. However, individuals with this disorder show serious aggression toward\nothers that is not part of the definition of oppositional defiant disorder.\nIntellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).\nIn individuals with intel-\nlectual disability, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder is given only if the opposi-\ntional behavior is markedly greater than is commonly observed among individuals of\ncomparable mental age and with comparable severity of intellectual disability.\nLanguage disorder.\nOppositional defiant disorder must also be distinguished from a\nfailure to follow directions that is the result of impaired language comprehension (e.g.,\nhearing loss).\nSocial anxiety disorder (social phobia).\nOppositional defiant disorder must also be dis-\ntinguished from defiance due to fear of negative evaluation associated with social anxiety\ndisorder.\n466\nDisruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct DisordersA diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be made when Criteria A1 and/\nor A2 are only met during an episode of another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive\ndisorder, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder), or when impulsive aggressive outbursts\nare attributable to another medical condition or to the physiological effects of a substance\nor medication. This diagnosis also should not be made, particularly in children and ado-\nlescents ages 6–18 years, when the impulsive aggressive outbursts occur in the context of\nan adjustment disorder. Other examples in which recurrent, problematic, impulsive ag-\ngressive outbursts may, or may not, be diagnosed as intermittent explosive disorder in-\nclude the following.\nDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder.\nIn contrast to intermittent explosive disorder,\ndisruptive mood dysregulation disorder is characterized by a persistently negative mood state\n(i.e., irritability, anger) most of the day, nearly every day, between impulsive aggressive out-\nbursts. A diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder can only be given when the on-\nset of recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive outbursts is before age 10 years. Finally, a\ndiagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be made for the first time\nafter age 18 years. Otherwise, these diagnoses are mutually exclusive.\nAntisocial personality disorder or borderline personality disorder.\nIndividuals with an-\ntisocial personality disorder or borderline personality disorder often display recurrent,\nproblematic impulsive aggressive outbursts. However, the level of impulsive aggression\nin individuals with antisocial personality disorder or borderline personality disorder is\nlower than that in individuals with intermittent explosive disorder.\nConduct Disorder\n469\nDelirium, major neurocognitive disorder, and personality change due to another med-\nical condition, aggressive type.\nA diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not\nbe made when aggressive outbursts are judged to result from the physiological effects of an-\nother diagnosable medical condition (e.g., brain injury associated with a change in personality\ncharacterized by aggressive outbursts; complex partial epilepsy). Nonspecific abnormalities\non neurological examination (e.g., “soft signs”) and nonspecific electroencephalographic\nchanges are compatible with a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder unless there is a di-\nagnosable medical condition that better explains the impulsive aggressive outbursts.\nSubstance intoxication or substance withdrawal.\nA diagnosis of intermittent explosive\ndisorder should not be made when impulsive aggressive outbursts are nearly always as-\nsociated with intoxication with or withdrawal from substances (e.g., alcohol, phencyclidine,\ncocaine and other stimulants, barbiturates, inhalants). However, when a sufficient number\nof impulsive aggressive outbursts also occur  in the absence of substance intoxication or\nwithdrawal, and these warrant independent clinical attention, a diagnosis of intermittent\nexplosive disorder may be given.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disor-\nder, or autism spectrum disorder.\nIndividuals with any of these childhood-onset dis-\norders may exhibit impulsive aggressive outbursts. Individuals with ADHD are typically\nimpulsive and, as a result, may also exhibit impulsive aggressive outbursts. While indi-\nviduals with conduct disorder can exhibit impulsive aggressive outbursts, the form of ag-\ngression characterized by the diagnostic criteria is proactive and predatory. Aggression in\noppositional defiant disorder is typically characterized by temper tantrums and verbal ar-\nguments with authority figures, whereas impulsive aggressive outbursts in intermittent\nexplosive disorder are in response to a broader array of provocation and include physical\nassault. The level of impulsive aggression in individuals with a history of one or more of\nthese disorders has been reported as lower than that in comparable individuals whose\nsymptoms also meet intermittent explosive disorder Criteria A through E. Accordingly, if\nCriteria A through E are also met, and the impulsive aggressive outbursts warrant inde-\npendent clinical attention, a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder may be given.Oppositional defiant disorder.\nConduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder are\nboth related to symptoms that bring the individual in conflict with adults and other au-\nConduct Disorder\n475\nthority figures (e.g., parents, teachers, work supervisors). The behaviors of oppositional\ndefiant disorder are typically of a less severe nature than those of individuals with conduct\ndisorder and do not include aggression toward individuals or animals, destruction of\nproperty, or a pattern of theft or deceit. Furthermore, oppositional defiant disorder in-\ncludes problems of emotional dysregulation (i.e., angry and irritable mood) that are not in-\ncluded in the definition of conduct disorder. When criteria are met for both oppositional\ndefiant disorder and conduct disorder, both diagnoses can be given.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nAlthough children with ADHD often exhibit\nhyperactive and impulsive behavior that may be disruptive, this behavior does not by it-\nself violate societal norms or the rights of others and therefore does not usually meet cri-\nteria for conduct disorder. When criteria are met for both ADHD and conduct disorder, both\ndiagnoses should be given.\nDepressive and bipolar disorders.\nIrritability, aggression, and conduct problems can\noccur in children or adolescents with a major depressive disorder, a bipolar disorder, or\ndisruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The behaviorial problems associated with these\nmood disorders can usually be distinguished from the pattern of conduct problems seen in\nconduct disorder based on their course. Specifically, persons with conduct disorder will\ndisplay substantial levels of aggressive or non-aggressive conduct problems during peri-\nods in which there is no mood disturbance, either historically (i.e., a history of conduct\nproblems predating the onset of the mood disturbance) or concurrently (i.e., display of\nsome conduct problems that are premeditated and do not occur during periods of intense\nemotional arousal). In those cases in which criteria for conduct disorder and a mood dis-\norder are met, both diagnoses can be given.\nIntermittent explosive disorder.\nBoth conduct disorder and intermittent explosive dis-\norder involve high rates of aggression. However, the aggression in individuals with inter-\nmittent explosive disorder is limited to impulsive aggression and is not premeditated, and\nit is not committed in order to achieve some tangible objective (e.g., money, power, intim-\nidation). Also, the definition of intermittent explosive disorder does not include the non-\naggressive symptoms of conduct disorder. If criteria for both disorders are met, the diag-\nnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should be given only when the recurrent impul-\nsive aggressive outbursts warrant independent clinical attention.\nAdjustment disorders.\nThe diagnosis of an adjustment disorder (with disturbance of con-\nduct or with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct) should be considered if clinically\nsignificant conduct problems that do not meet the criteria for another specific disorder de-\nvelop in clear association with the onset of a psychosocial stressor and do not resolve within\n6 months of the termination of the stressor (or its consequences). Conduct disorder is diag-\nnosed only when the conduct problems represent a repetitive and persistent pattern that is\nassociated with impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning.Other causes of intentional fire setting.\nIt is important to rule out other causes of fire\nsetting before giving the diagnosis of pyromania. Intentional fire setting may occur for\nprofit, sabotage, or revenge; to conceal a crime; to make a political statement (e.g., an act of\nterrorism or protest); or to attract attention or recognition (e.g., setting a fire in order to dis-\ncover it and save the day). Fire setting may also occur as part of developmental experi-\nmentation in childhood (e.g., playing with matches, lighters, or fire).\nOther mental disorders.\nA separate diagnosis of pyromania is not given when fire set-\nting occurs as part of conduct disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial personality disorder,\nor if it occurs in response to a delusion or a hallucination (e.g., in schizophrenia) or is at-\ntributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition (e.g., epilepsy). The di-\nagnosis of pyromania should also not be given when fire setting results from impaired\njudgment associated with major neurocognitive disorder, intellectual disability, or sub-\nstance intoxication.Ordinary theft.\nKleptomania should be distinguished from ordinary acts of theft or\nshoplifting. Ordinary theft (whether planned or impulsive) is deliberate and is motivated\nby the usefulness of the object or its monetary worth. Some individuals, especially adoles-\ncents, may also steal on a dare, as an act of rebellion, or as a rite of passage. The diagnosis\nis not made unless other characteristic features of kleptomania are also present. Klepto-\nmania is exceedingly rare, whereas shoplifting is relatively common.\nMalingering.\nIn malingering, individuals may simulate the symptoms of kleptomania to\navoid criminal prosecution.\nAntisocial personality disorder and conduct disorder.\nAntisocial personality disorder\nand conduct disorder are distinguished from kleptomania by a general pattern of antiso-\ncial behavior.\nManic episodes, psychotic episodes, and major neurocognitive disorder.\nKleptomania\nshould be distinguished from intentional or inadvertent stealing that may occur during a\nmanic episode, in response to delusions or hallucinations (as in, e.g., schizophrenia), or as\na result of a major neurocognitive disorder.", "comorbidity": "In clinical settings, comorbid disorders are frequent in individuals whose symptoms meet\ncriteria for ADHD. In the general population, oppositional defiant disorder co-occurs with\nADHD in approximately half of children with the combined presentation and about a\nquarter with the predominantly inattentive presentation. Conduct disorder co-occurs in\nabout a quarter of children or adolescents with the combined presentation, depending on\nage and setting. Most children and adolescents with disruptive mood dysregulation dis-\norder have symptoms that also meet criteria for ADHD; a lesser percentage of children\nwith ADHD have symptoms that meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disor-\nder. Specific learning disorder commonly co-occurs with ADHD. Anxiety disorders and\nmajor depressive disorder occur in a minority of individuals with ADHD but more often\nthan in the general population. Intermittent explosive disorder occurs in a minority of\nadults with ADHD, but at rates above population levels. Although substance use disor-\nders are relatively more frequent among adults with ADHD in the general population, the\ndisorders are present in only a minority of adults with ADHD. In adults, antisocial and\nother personality disorders may co-occur with ADHD. Other disorders that may co-occur\nwith ADHD include obsessive-compulsive disorder, tic disorders, and autism spectrum\ndisorder.\nOther Specified Attention-Deficit/\nHyperactivity Disorder\n314.01 (F90.8)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of attention-\ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in so-\ncial, occupational or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the\nfull criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or any of the disorders in the neuro-\ndevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The other specified attention-deficit/hyperactiv-\nity disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate\n66\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nthe specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder or any specific neurodevelopmental disorder. This is done by re-\ncording “other specified attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder” followed by the specific\nreason (e.g., “with insufficient inattention symptoms”).\nUnspecified Attention-Deficit/\nHyperactivity Disorder\n314.01 (F90.9)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of attention-\ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in so-\ncial, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the\nfull criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or any of the disorders in the neuro-\ndevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified attention-deficit/hyperactivity\ndisorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the rea-\nson that the criteria are not met for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or for a specific\nneurodevelopmental disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient in-\nformation to make a more specific diagnosis.\nSpecific Learning Disorder\nSpecific Learning DisorderSpecific learning disorder commonly co-occurs with neurodevelopmental (e.g., ADHD,\ncommunication disorders, developmental coordination disorder, autistic spectrum disor-\nder) or other mental disorders (e.g., anxiety disorders, depressive and bipolar disorders).\nThese comorbidities do not necessarily exclude the diagnosis specific learning disorder\nbut may make testing and differential diagnosis more difficult, because each of the co-\noccurring disorders independently interferes with the execution of activities of daily liv-\ning, including learning. Thus, clinical judgment is required to attribute such impairment to\nlearning difficulties. If there is an indication that another diagnosis could account for the\ndifficulties learning keystone academic skills described in Criterion A, specific learning\ndisorder should not be diagnosed.\nMotor Disorders\nDevelopmental Coordination DisorderDisorders that commonly co-occur with developmental coordination disorder include\nspeech and language disorder; specific learning disorder (especially reading and writing);\nproblems of inattention, including ADHD (the most frequent coexisting condition, with\nabout 50% co-occurrence); autism spectrum disorder; disruptive and emotional behavior\nproblems; and joint hypermobility syndrome. Different clusters of co-occurrence may be\npresent (e.g., a cluster with severe reading disorders, fine motor problems, and handwriting\nproblems; another cluster with impaired movement control and motor planning). Presence\nof other disorders does not exclude developmental coordination disorder but may make\ntesting more difficult and may independently interfere with the execution of activities of\ndaily living, thus requiring examiner judgment in ascribing impairment to motor skills.\nStereotypic Movement DisorderStereotypic movement disorder may occur as a primary diagnosis or secondary to another\ndisorder. For example, stereotypies are a common manifestation of a variety of neuro-\ngenetic disorders, such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Rett syndrome, fragile X syndrome,\nCornelia de Lange syndrome, and Smith-Magenis syndrome. When stereotypic move-\nment disorder co-occurs with another medical condition, both should be coded.\nTic Disorders\n81\nTic DisordersMany medical and psychiatric conditions have been described as co-occurring with tic disor-\nders, with ADHD and obsessive-compulsive and related disorders being particularly com-\nmon. The obsessive-compulsive symptoms observed in tic disorder tend to be characterized\nby more aggressive symmetry and order symptoms and poorer response to pharmacotherapy\nwith selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Children with ADHD may demonstrate disrup-\ntive behavior, social immaturity, and learning difficulties that may interfere with academic\nprogress and interpersonal relationships and lead to greater impairment than that caused by a\ntic disorder. Individuals with tic disorders can also have other movement disorders and other\nmental disorders, such as depressive, bipolar, or substance use disorders.\nOther Specified Tic Disorder\n307.20 (F95.8)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a tic disorder\nthat cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other im-\nportant areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for a tic disorder\nor any of the disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The other\nspecified tic disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to com-\nmunicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for a tic disor-\nder or any specific neurodevelopmental disorder. This is done by recording “other specified\ntic disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “with onset after age 18 years”).\nUnspecified Tic Disorder\n307.20 (F95.9)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a tic disorder\nthat cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other im-\nportant areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for a tic disorder\nor for any of the disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The un-\nspecified tic disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to\nspecify the reason that the criteria are not met for a tic disorder or for a specific neurode-\nvelopmental disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information\nto make a more specific diagnosis.\n86\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nOther Neurodevelopmental Disorders\nOther Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder\n315.8 (F88)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a neurodevel-\nopmental disorder that cause impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas\nof functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the\nneurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The other specified neurodevelopmental\ndisorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the\nspecific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific neurode-\nvelopmental disorder. This is done by recording “other specified neurodevelopmental dis-\norder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “neurodevelopmental disorder associated with\nprenatal alcohol exposure”).\nAn example of a presentation that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-\nnation is the following:\nNeurodevelopmental disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure: Neu-\nrodevelopmental disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure is characterized\nby a range of developmental disabilities following exposure to alcohol in utero.\nUnspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder\n315.9 (F89)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a neurodevel-\nopmental disorder that cause impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas\nof functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the\nneurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified neurodevelopmental dis-\norder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason\nthat the criteria are not met for a specific neurodevelopmental disorder, and includes pre-\nsentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis\n(e.g., in emergency room settings).\n87\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and\nOther Psychotic Disorders\nSchizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders include schizophrenia,\nother psychotic disorders, and schizotypal (personality) disorder. They are defined by ab-\nnormalities in one or more of the following five domains: delusions, hallucinations, disor-\nganized thinking (speech), grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior (including\ncatatonia), and negative symptoms.\nKey Features That Define the Psychotic Disorders\nDelusions\nDelusions are fixed beliefs that are not amenable to change in light of conflicting evidence.\nTheir content may include a variety of themes (e.g., persecutory, referential, somatic, reli-\ngious, grandiose). Persecutory delusions (i.e., belief that one is going to be harmed, harassed,\nand so forth by an individual, organization, or other group) are most common. Referential\ndelusions (i.e., belief that certain gestures, comments, environmental cues, and so forth are\ndirected at oneself) are also common. Grandiose delusions (i.e., when an individual believes\nthat he or she has exceptional abilities, wealth, or fame) and erotomanic delusions (i.e., when\nan individual believes falsely that another person is in love with him or her) are also seen.\nNihilistic delusions involve the conviction that a major catastrophe will occur, and somatic\ndelusions focus on preoccupations regarding health and organ function.\nDelusions are deemed bizarre if they are clearly implausible and not understandable to\nsame-culture peers and do not derive from ordinary life experiences. An example of a bi-\nzarre delusion is the belief that an outside force has removed his or her internal organs and\nreplaced them with someone else’s organs without leaving any wounds or scars. An ex-\nample of a nonbizarre delusion is the belief that one is under surveillance by the police, de-\nspite a lack of convincing evidence. Delusions that express a loss of control over mind or\nbody are generally considered to be bizarre; these include the belief that one’s thoughts\nhave been “removed” by some outside force (thought withdrawal), that alien thoughts have\nbeen put into one’s mind (thought insertion), or that one’s body or actions are being acted on\nor manipulated by some outside force (delusions of control). The distinction between a de-\nlusion and a strongly held idea is sometimes difficult to make and depends in part on the\ndegree of conviction with which the belief is held despite clear or reasonable contradictory\nevidence regarding its veracity.\nHallucinations\nHallucinations are perception-like experiences that occur without an external stimulus.\nThey are vivid and clear, with the full force and impact of normal perceptions, and not\nunder voluntary control. They may occur in any sensory modality, but auditory halluci-\nnations are the most common in schizophrenia and related disorders. Auditory hallucina-\ntions are usually experienced as voices, whether familiar or unfamiliar, that are perceived\nas distinct from the individual’s own thoughts. The hallucinations must occur in the con-\ntext of a clear sensorium; those that occur while falling asleep (hypnagogic) or waking up\n88\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\n(hypnopompic) are considered to be within the range of normal experience. Hallucinations\nmay be a normal part of religious experience in certain cultural contexts.\nDisorganized Thinking (Speech)\nDisorganized thinking (formal thought disorder) is typically inferred from the individual’s\nspeech. The individual may switch from one topic to another (derailment or loose associa-\ntions). Answers to questions may be obliquely related or completely unrelated (tangential-\nity). Rarely, speech may be so severely disorganized that it is nearly incomprehensible and\nresembles receptive aphasia in its linguistic disorganization (incoherence or “word salad”).\nBecause mildly disorganized speech is common and nonspecific, the symptom must be se-\nvere enough to substantially impair effective communication. The severity of the impair-\nment may be difficult to evaluate if the person making the diagnosis comes from a\ndifferent linguistic background than that of the person being examined. Less severe dis-\norganized thinking or speech may occur during the prodromal and residual periods of\nschizophrenia.\nGrossly Disorganized or Abnormal Motor Behavior\n(Including Catatonia)\nGrossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior may manifest itself in a variety of ways,\nranging from childlike “silliness” to unpredictable agitation. Problems may be noted in\nany form of goal-directed behavior, leading to difficulties in performing activities of daily\nliving.\nCatatonic behavior is a marked decrease in reactivity to the environment. This ranges\nfrom resistance to instructions (negativism); to maintaining a rigid, inappropriate or bi-\nzarre posture; to a complete lack of verbal and motor responses (mutism and stupor). It can\nalso include purposeless and excessive motor activity without obvious cause (catatonic\nexcitement). Other features are repeated stereotyped movements, staring, grimacing,\nmutism, and the echoing of speech. Although catatonia has historically been associated\nwith schizophrenia, catatonic symptoms are nonspecific and may occur in other mental\ndisorders (e.g., bipolar or depressive disorders with catatonia) and in medical conditions\n(catatonic disorder due to another medical condition).\nNegative Symptoms\nNegative symptoms account for a substantial portion of the morbidity associated with\nschizophrenia but are less prominent in other psychotic disorders. Two negative symp-\ntoms are particularly prominent in schizophrenia: diminished emotional expression and\navolition. Diminished emotional expression includes reductions in the expression of emo-\ntions in the face, eye contact, intonation of speech (prosody), and movements of the hand,\nhead, and face that normally give an emotional emphasis to speech. Avolition is a decrease\nin motivated self-initiated purposeful activities. The individual may sit for long periods of\ntime and show little interest in participating in work or social activities. Other negative\nsymptoms include alogia, anhedonia, and asociality. Alogia is manifested by diminished\nspeech output. Anhedonia is the decreased ability to experience pleasure from positive\nstimuli or a degradation in the recollection of pleasure previously experienced. Asociality\nrefers to the apparent lack of interest in social interactions and may be associated with avo-\nlition, but it can also be a manifestation of limited opportunities for social interactions.\nDisorders in This Chapter\nThis chapter is organized along a gradient of psychopathology. Clinicians should first con-\nsider conditions that do not reach full criteria for a psychotic disorder or are limited to one\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\n89\ndomain of psychopathology. Then they should consider time-limited conditions. Finally,\nthe diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder requires the exclusion of another con-\ndition that may give rise to psychosis.\nSchizotypal personality disorder is noted within this chapter as it is considered within\nthe schizophrenia spectrum, although its full description is found in the chapter “Person-\nality Disorders.” The diagnosis schizotypal personality disorder captures a pervasive pat-\ntern of social and interpersonal deficits, including reduced capacity for close relationships;\ncognitive or perceptual distortions; and eccentricities of behavior, usually beginning by\nearly adulthood but in some cases first becoming apparent in childhood and adolescence.\nAbnormalities of beliefs, thinking, and perception are below the threshold for the diagno-\nsis of a psychotic disorder.\nTwo conditions are defined by abnormalities limited to one domain of psychosis: delu-\nsions or catatonia. Delusional disorder is characterized by at least 1 month of delusions but\nno other psychotic symptoms. Catatonia is described later in the chapter and further in this\ndiscussion.\nBrief psychotic disorder lasts more than 1 day and remits by 1 month. Schizophreni-\nform disorder is characterized by a symptomatic presentation equivalent to that of schizo-\nphrenia except for its duration (less than 6 months) and the absence of a requirement for a\ndecline in functioning.\nSchizophrenia lasts for at least 6 months and includes at least 1 month of active-phase\nsymptoms. In schizoaffective disorder, a mood episode and the active-phase symptoms of\nschizophrenia occur together and were preceded or are followed by at least 2 weeks of de-\nlusions or hallucinations without prominent mood symptoms.\nPsychotic disorders may be induced by another condition. In substance/medication-\ninduced psychotic disorder, the psychotic symptoms are judged to be a physiological con-\nsequence of a drug of abuse, a medication, or toxin exposure and cease after removal of the\nagent. In psychotic disorder due to another medical condition, the psychotic symptoms\nare judged to be a direct physiological consequence of another medical condition.\nCatatonia can occur in several disorders, including neurodevelopmental, psychotic, bi-\npolar, depressive, and other mental disorders. This chapter also includes the diagnoses\ncatatonia associated with another mental disorder (catatonia specifier), catatonic disorder\ndue to another medical condition, and unspecified catatonia, and the diagnostic criteria for\nall three conditions are described together.\nOther specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disor-\nders are included for classifying psychotic presentations that do not meet the criteria for\nany of the specific psychotic disorders, or psychotic symptomatology about which there is\ninadequate or contradictory information.\nClinician-Rated Assessment of Symptoms and\nRelated Clinical Phenomena in Psychosis\nPsychotic disorders are heterogeneous, and the severity of symptoms can predict impor-\ntant aspects of the illness, such as the degree of cognitive or neurobiological deficits. To\nmove the field forward, a detailed framework for the assessment of severity is included in\nSection III “Assessment Measures,” which may help with treatment planning, prognostic\ndecision making, and research on pathophysiological mechanisms. Section III “Assess-\nment Measures” also contains dimensional assessments of the primary symptoms of psy-\nchosis, including hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech (except for substance/\nmedication-induced psychotic disorder and psychotic disorder due to another medical\ncondition), abnormal psychomotor behavior, and negative symptoms, as well as dimen-\nsional assessments of depression and mania. The severity of mood symptoms in psychosis\nhas prognostic value  and guides treatment. There is growing evidence that schizoaffective\n90\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\ndisorder is not a distinct nosological category. Thus, dimensional assessments of depres-\nsion and mania for all psychotic disorders alert clinicians to mood pathology and the need\nto treat where appropriate. The Section III scale also includes a dimensional assessment of\ncognitive impairment. Many individuals with psychotic disorders have impairments in a\nrange of cognitive domains that predict functional status. Clinical neuropsychological as-\nsessment can help guide diagnosis and treatment, but brief assessments without formal\nneuropsychological assessment can provide useful information that can be sufficient for\ndiagnostic purposes. Formal neuropsychological testing, when conducted, should be ad-\nministered and scored by personnel trained in the use of testing instruments. If a formal\nneuropsychological assessment is not conducted, the clinician should use the best avail-\nable information to make a judgment. Further research on these assessments is necessary\nin order to determine their clinical utility; thus, the assessments available in Section III\nshould serve as a prototype to stimulate such research.\nSchizotypal (Personality) Disorder\nCriteria and text for schizotypal personality disorder can be found in the chapter “Person-\nality Disorders.” Because this disorder is considered part of the schizophrenia spectrum of\ndisorders, and is labeled in this section of ICD-9 and ICD-10 as schizotypal disorder, it is\nlisted in this chapter and discussed in detail in the DSM-5 chapter “Personality Disorders.”\nDelusional DisorderRates of comorbidity with substance-related disorders are high in schizophrenia. Over\nhalf of individuals with schizophrenia have tobacco use disorder and smoke cigarettes\nregularly. Comorbidity with anxiety disorders is increasingly recognized in schizophre-\nnia. Rates of obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder are elevated in individuals\nwith schizophrenia compared with the general population. Schizotypal or paranoid per-\nsonality disorder may sometimes precede the onset of schizophrenia.\nLife expectancy is reduced in individuals with schizophrenia because of associated\nmedical conditions. Weight gain, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular and\npulmonary disease are more common in schizophrenia than in the general population.\nPoor engagement in health maintenance behaviors (e.g., cancer screening, exercise) in-\ncreases the risk of chronic disease, but other disorder factors, including medications, life-\nstyle, cigarette smoking, and diet, may also play a role. A shared vulnerability for\npsychosis and medical disorders may explain some of the medical comorbidity of schizo-\nphrenia.\nSchizoaffective DisorderMany individuals diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder are also diagnosed with other\nmental disorders, especially substance use disorders and anxiety disorders. Similarly, the\nincidence of medical conditions is increased above base rate for the general population\nand leads to decreased life expectancy.\nSubstance/Medication-Induced\nPsychotic DisorderPsychotic disorder due to another medical condition in individuals older than 80 years is\nassociated with concurrent major neurocognitive disorder (dementia).\nCatatonia Associated With Another Mental Disorder (Catatonia Specifier)\n119\nCatatonia\nCatatonia can occur in the context of several disorders, including neurodevelopmental,\npsychotic, bipolar, depressive disorders, and other medical conditions (e.g., cerebral folate\ndeficiency, rare autoimmune and paraneoplastic disorders. The manual does not treat\ncatatonia as an independent class but recognizes a) catatonia associated with another men-\ntal disorder (i.e., a neurodevelopmental, psychotic disorder, a bipolar disorder, a depres-\nsive disorder, or other mental disorder), b) catatonic disorder due to another medical\ncondition, and c) unspecified catatonia.\nCatatonia is defined by the presence of three or more of 12 psychomotor features in theders. Females with bipolar I or II disorder are more likely to experience depressive symptoms\nthan males. They also have a higher lifetime risk of alcohol use disorder than are males and a\nmuch greater likelihood of alcohol use disorder than do females in the general population.\nBipolar I Disorder\n131Co-occurring mental disorders are common, with the most frequent disorders being any\nanxiety disorder (e.g., panic attacks, social anxiety disorder [social phobia], specific pho-\nbia), occurring in approximately three-fourths of individuals; ADHD, any disruptive, im-\npulse-control, or conduct disorder (e.g., intermittent explosive disorder, oppositional\ndefiant disorder, conduct disorder), and any substance use disorder (e.g., alcohol use dis-\norder) occur in over half of individuals with bipolar I disorder. Adults with bipolar I dis-\norder have high rates of serious and/or untreated co-occurring medical conditions.\nMetabolic syndrome and migraine are more common among individuals with bipolar dis-\norder than in the general population. More than half of individuals whose symptoms meet\ncriteria for bipolar disorder have an alcohol use disorder, and those with both disorders\nare at greater risk for suicide attempt.\nBipolar II DisorderBipolar II disorder is more often than not associated with one or more co-occurring mental\ndisorders, with anxiety disorders being the most common. Approximately 60% of individ-\nuals with bipolar II disorder have three or more co-occurring mental disorders; 75% have\nan anxiety disorder; and 37% have a substance use disorder. Children and adolescents\nwith bipolar II disorder have a higher rate of co-occurring anxiety disorders compared\nwith those with bipolar I disorder, and the anxiety disorder most often predates the bi-\npolar disorder. Anxiety and substance use disorders occur in individuals with bipolar II\ndisorder at a higher rate than in the general population. Approximately 14% of individuals\nwith bipolar II disorder have at least one lifetime eating disorder, with binge-eating dis-\norder being more common than bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa.\nThese commonly co-occurring disorders do not seem to follow a course of illness that\nis truly independent from that of the bipolar disorder, but rather have strong associations\nwith mood states. For example, anxiety and eating disorders tend to associate most with\ndepressive symptoms, and substance use disorders are moderately associated with manic\nsymptoms.\nCyclothymic DisorderSubstance-related disorders and sleep disorders (i.e., difficulties in initiating and main-\ntaining sleep) may be present in individuals with cyclothymic disorder. Most children\nwith cyclothymic disorder treated in outpatient psychiatric settings have comorbid mental\nconditions; they are more likely than other pediatric patients with mental disorders to\nhave comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\n142\nBipolar and Related Disorders\nSubstance/Medication-Induced\nBipolar and Related DisorderComorbidities are those associated with the use of illicit substances (in the case of illegal\nstimulants or phencyclidine) or diversion of prescribed stimulants. Comorbidities related\nto steroid or immunosuppressant medications are those medical indications for these\npreparations. Delirium can occur before or along with manic symptoms in individuals in-\ngesting phencyclidine or those who are prescribed steroid medications or other immuno-\nsuppressant medications.\nBipolar and Related Disorder\nDue to Another Medical ConditionConditions comorbid with bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition\nare those associated with the medical conditions of etiological relevance. Delirium can oc-\ncur before or along with manic symptoms in individuals with Cushing’s disease.\n148\nBipolar and Related Disorders\nOther Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder\n296.89 (F31.89)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a bipolar and\nrelated disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria\nfor any of the disorders in the bipolar and related disorders diagnostic class. The other\nspecified bipolar and related disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician\nchooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the cri-\nteria for any specific bipolar and related disorder. This is done by recording “other speci-\nfied bipolar and related disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “short-duration\ncyclothymia”).\nExamples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation\ninclude the following:\n1. Short-duration hypomanic episodes (2–3 days) and major depressive episodes: A\nlifetime history of one or more major depressive episodes in individuals whose presenta-\ntion has never met full criteria for a manic or hypomanic episode but who have experienced\ntwo or more episodes of short-duration hypomania that meet the full symptomatic criteria\nfor a hypomanic episode but that only last for 2–3 days. The episodes of hypomanic symp-\ntoms do not overlap in time with the major depressive episodes, so the disturbance does\nnot meet criteria for major depressive episode, with mixed features.\n2. Hypomanic episodes with insufficient symptoms and major depressive epi-\nsodes: A lifetime history of one or more major depressive episodes in individuals\nwhose presentation has never met full criteria for a manic or hypomanic episode but\nwho have experienced one or more episodes of hypomania that do not meet full symp-\ntomatic criteria (i.e., at least 4 consecutive days of elevated mood and one or two of\nthe other symptoms of a hypomanic episode, or irritable mood and two or three of the\nother symptoms of a hypomanic episode). The episodes of hypomanic symptoms do\nnot overlap in time with the major depressive episodes, so the disturbance does not\nmeet criteria for major depressive episode, with mixed features.\n3. Hypomanic episode without prior major depressive episode: One or more hypo-\nmanic episodes in an individual whose presentation has never met full criteria for a ma-\njor depressive episode or a manic episode. If this occurs in an individual with an\nestablished diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), both diagnoses\ncan be concurrently applied during the periods when the full criteria for a hypomanic\nepisode are met.\n4. Short-duration cyclothymia (less than 24 months): Multiple episodes of hypomanic\nsymptoms that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic episode and multiple episodes of de-\npressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a major depressive episode that persist\nover a period of less than 24 months (less than 12 months for children or adolescents)\nin an individual whose presentation has never met full criteria for a major depressive,\nmanic, or hypomanic episode and does not meet criteria for any psychotic disorder. Dur-\ning the course of the disorder, the hypomanic or depressive symptoms are present for\nmore days than not, the individual has not been without symptoms for more than 2 months\nat a time, and the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment.\nUnspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder\n149\nUnspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder\n296.80 (F31.9)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a bipolar and\nrelated disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria\nfor any of the disorders in the bipolar and related disorders diagnostic class. The unspec-\nified bipolar and related disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician choos-\nes not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific bipolar and related\ndisorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a\nmore specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).Rates of comorbidity in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are extremely high. It is\nrare to find individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation\ndisorder alone. Comorbidity between disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and other\nDSM-defined syndromes appears higher than for many other pediatric mental illnesses;\nthe strongest overlap is with oppositional defiant disorder. Not only is the overall rate ofbid illnesses appears particularly diverse. These children typically present to the clinic\nwith a wide range of disruptive behavior, mood, anxiety, and even autism spectrum\nsymptoms and diagnoses. However, children with disruptive mood dysregulation disor-\nder should not have symptoms that meet criteria for bipolar disorder, as in that context,\nonly the bipolar disorder diagnosis should be made. If children have symptoms that meet\ncriteria for oppositional defiant disorder or intermittent explosive disorder and disruptive\nmood dysregulation disorder, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disor-\nder should be assigned. Also, as noted earlier, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregu-\nlation disorder should not be assigned if the symptoms occur only in an anxiety-\nprovoking context, when the routines of a child with autism spectrum disorder or obses-\nsive-compulsive disorder are disturbed, or in the context of a major depressive episode.\nMajor Depressive DisorderOther disorders with which major depressive disorder frequently co-occurs are substance-\nrelated disorders, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, buli-\nmia nervosa, and borderline personality disorder.\nPersistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)In comparison to individuals with major depressive disorder, those with persistent de-\npressive disorder are at higher risk for psychiatric comorbidity in general, and for anxiety\ndisorders and substance use disorders in particular. Early-onset persistent depressive dis-\norder is strongly associated with DSM-IV Cluster B and C personality disorders.\nPremenstrual Dysphoric DisorderA major depressive episode is the most frequently reported previous disorder in individuals\npresenting with premenstrual dysphoric disorder. A wide range of medical (e.g., migraine,\nasthma, allergies, seizure disorders) or other mental disorders (e.g., depressive and bipolar\ndisorders, anxiety disorders, bulimia nervosa, substance use disorders) may worsen in the\npremenstrual phase; however, the absence of a symptom-free period during the postmen-\nstrual interval obviates a diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. These conditions\nare better considered premenstrual exacerbation of a current mental or medical disorder. Al-\nthough the diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder should not be assigned in situa-\ntions in which an individual only experiences a premenstrual exacerbation of another\nmental or physical disorder, it can be considered in addition to the diagnosis of another men-\ntal or physical disorder if the individual experiences symptoms and changes in level of func-\ntioning that are characteristic of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and markedly different\nfrom the symptoms experienced as part of the ongoing disorder.\nSubstance/Medication-Induced\nDepressive DisorderCompared with individuals with major depressive disorder and no comorbid substance\nuse disorder, those with substance/medication-induced depressive disorder have higher\nrates of comorbidity with any DSM-IV mental disorder; are more likely to have specific\nDSM-IV disorders of pathological gambling and paranoid, histrionic, and antisocial per-\nsonality disorders; and are less likely to have persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia).\nCompared with individuals with major depressive disorder and a comorbid substance use\ndisorder, individuals with substance/medication-induced depressive disorder are more\nlikely to have alcohol use disorder, any other substance use disorder, and histrionic per-\nsonality disorder; however, they are less likely to have persistent depressive disorder.\nDepressive Disorder\nDue to Another Medical ConditionConditions comorbid with depressive disorder due to another medical condition are those\nassociated with the medical conditions of etiological relevance. It has been noted that de-\nlirium can occur before or along with depressive symptoms in individuals with a variety\nof medical conditions, such as Cushing’s disease. The association of anxiety symptoms,\nusually generalized symptoms, is common in depressive disorders, regardless of cause.\nOther Specified Depressive Disorder\n311 (F32.8)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a depressive\ndisorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or\nother important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of\nthe disorders in the depressive disorders diagnostic class. The other specified depressive\ndisorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the\nspecific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific depressive\ndisorder. This is done by recording “other specified depressive disorder” followed by the\nspecific reason (e.g., “short-duration depressive episode”).\nExamples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation\ninclude the following:\n1. Recurrent brief depression: Concurrent presence of depressed mood and at least\nfour other symptoms of depression for 2–13 days at least once per month (not associ-\nated with the menstrual cycle) for at least 12 consecutive months in an individual\nwhose presentation has never met criteria for any other depressive or bipolar disorder\nand does not currently meet active or residual criteria for any psychotic disorder.\n2. Short-duration depressive episode (4–13 days): Depressed affect and at least four\nof the other eight symptoms of a major depressive episode associated with clinically\nsignificant distress or impairment that persists for more than 4 days, but less than 14 days,\nin an individual whose presentation has never met criteria for any other depressive or\nbipolar disorder, does not currently meet active or residual criteria for any psychotic dis-\norder, and does not meet criteria for recurrent brief depression.\n3. Depressive episode with insufficient symptoms: Depressed affect and at least one\nof the other eight symptoms of a major depressive episode associated with clinically\n184\nDepressive Disorders\nsignificant distress or impairment that persist for at least 2 weeks in an individual\nwhose presentation has never met criteria for any other depressive or bipolar disorder,\ndoes not currently meet active or residual criteria for any psychotic disorder, and does\nnot meet criteria for mixed anxiety and depressive disorder symptoms.\nUnspecified Depressive Disorder\n311 (F32.9)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a depressive dis-\norder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other im-\nportant areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders\nin the depressive disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified depressive disorder category is\nused in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are\nnot met for a specific depressive disorder, and includes presentations for which there is insuf-\nficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).In children, separation anxiety disorder is highly comorbid with generalized anxiety dis-\norder and specific phobia. In adults, common comorbidities include specific phobia,\nPTSD, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia,\nobsessive-compulsive disorder, and personality disorders. Depressive and bipolar disor-\nders are also comorbid with separation anxiety disorder in adults.\nSelective MutismThe most common comorbid conditions are other anxiety disorders, most commonly so-\ncial anxiety disorder, followed by separation anxiety disorder and specific phobia. Oppo-\nsitional behaviors have been noted to occur in children with selective mutism, although\noppositional behavior may be limited to situations requiring speech. Communication de-\nlays or disorders also may appear in some children with selective mutism.\nSpecific PhobiaSpecific phobia is rarely seen in medical-clinical settings in the absence of other psycho-\npathology and is more frequently seen in nonmedical mental health settings. Specific pho-\nbia is frequently associated with a range of other disorders, especially depression in older\nadults. Because of early onset, specific phobia is typically the temporally primary disorder.\nIndividuals with specific phobia are at increased risk for the development of other dis-\norders, including other anxiety disorders, depressive and bipolar disorders, substance-\nrelated disorders, somatic symptom and related disorders, and personality disorders (par-\nticularly dependent personality disorder).\nSocial Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)Social anxiety disorder is often comorbid with other anxiety disorders, major depressive\ndisorder, and substance use disorders, and the onset of social anxiety disorder generally\nprecedes that of the other disorders, except for specific phobia and separation anxiety dis-\norder. Chronic social isolation in the course of a social anxiety disorder may result in major\ndepressive disorder. Comorbidity with depression is high also in older adults. Substances\nmay be used as self-medication for social fears, but the symptoms of substance intoxica-\ntion or withdrawal, such as trembling, may also be a source of (further) social fear. Social\nanxiety disorder is frequently comorbid with bipolar disorder or body dysmorphic disor-\nder; for example, an individual has body dysmorphic disorder concerning a preoccupa-\ntion with a slight irregularity of her nose, as well as social anxiety disorder because of a\nsevere fear of sounding unintelligent. The more generalized form of social anxiety disor-\nder, but not social anxiety disorder, performance only, is often comorbid with avoidant\npersonality disorder. In children, comorbidities with high-functioning autism and selec-\ntive mutism are common.\nPanic DisorderPanic disorder infrequently occurs in clinical settings in the absence of other psychopa-\nthology. The prevalence of panic disorder is elevated in individuals with other disorders,\nparticularly other anxiety disorders (and especially agoraphobia), major depression, bipo-\nlar disorder, and possibly mild alcohol use disorder. While panic disorder often has an ear-\nlier age at onset than the comorbid disorder(s), onset sometimes occurs after the comorbid\ndisorder and may be seen as a severity marker of the comorbid illness.\nReported lifetime rates of comorbidity between major depressive disorder and panic\ndisorder vary widely, ranging from 10% to 65% in individuals with panic disorder. In ap-\nproximately one-third of individuals with both disorders, the depression precedes the on-\nset of panic disorder. In the remaining two-thirds, depression occurs coincident with or\nfollowing the onset of panic disorder. A subset of individuals with panic disorder develop\na substance-related disorder, which for some represents an attempt to treat their anxiety\n214\nAnxiety Disorders\nwith alcohol or medications. Comorbidity with other anxiety disorders and illness anxiety\ndisorder is also common.\nPanic disorder is significantly comorbid with numerous general medical symptoms\nand conditions, including, but not limited to, dizziness, cardiac arrhythmias, hyperthy-\nroidism, asthma, COPD, and irritable bowel syndrome. However, the nature of the asso-\nciation (e.g., cause and effect) between panic disorder and these conditions remains\nunclear. Although mitral valve prolapse and thyroid disease are more common among in-\ndividuals with panic disorder than in the general population, the differences in prevalence\nare not consistent.\nPanic Attack Specifier\n\nNote: Symptoms are presented for the purpose of identifying a panic attack; however,\npanic attack is not a mental disorder and cannot be coded. Panic attacks can occur in the\ncontext of any anxiety disorder as well as other mental disorders (e.g., depressive disor-\nders, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders) and some medical condi-\ntions (e.g., cardiac, respiratory, vestibular, gastrointestinal). When the presence of a panic\nattack is identified, it should be noted as a specifier (e.g., “posttraumatic stress disorder\nwith panic attacks”). For panic disorder, the presence of panic attack is contained within\nthe criteria for the disorder and panic attack is not used as a specifier.\nAn abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes,\nand during which time four (or more) of the following symptoms occur:\nNote: The abrupt surge can occur from a calm state or an anxious state.\n1. Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate.\n2. Sweating.\n3. Trembling or shaking.\n4. Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering.\n5. Feelings of choking.\n6. Chest pain or discomfort.\n7. Nausea or abdominal distress.\n8. Feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed, or faint.\n9. Chills or heat sensations.\n10. Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations).\n11. Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself).\n12. Fear of losing control or “going crazy.”\n13. Fear of dying.\nNote: Culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, uncontrollable\nscreaming or crying) may be seen. Such symptoms should not count as one of the four\nrequired symptoms.\nFeatures\nThe essential feature of a panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort\nthat reaches a peak within minutes and during which time four or more of 13 physical and cog-\nnitive symptoms occur. Eleven of these 13 symptoms are physical (e.g., palpitations, sweat-\ning), while two are cognitive (i.e., fear of losing control or going crazy, fear of dying). “Fear of\ngoing crazy” is a colloquialism often used by individuals with panic attacks and is not in-\ntended as a pejorative or diagnostic term. The term within minutes means that the time to peak\nPanic Attack Specifier\n215\nintensity is literally only a few minutes. A panic attack can arise from either a calm state or an\nanxious state, and time to peak intensity should be assessed independently of any preceding\nanxiety. That is, the start of the panic attack is the point at which there is an abrupt increase in\ndiscomfort rather than the point at which anxiety first developed. Likewise, a panic attack can\nreturn to either an anxious state or a calm state and possibly peak again. A panic attack is dis-\ntinguished from ongoing anxiety by its time to peak intensity, which occurs within minutes; its\ndiscrete nature; and its typically greater severity. Attacks that meet all other criteria but have\nfewer than four physical and/or cognitive symptoms are referred to as limited-symptom attacks.\nThere are two characteristic types of panic attacks: expected and unexpected. Expected\npanic attacks are attacks for which there is an obvious cue or trigger, such as situations in\nwhich panic attacks have typically occurred. Unexpected panic attacks are those for which\nthere is no obvious cue or trigger at the time of occurrence (e.g., when relaxing or out of\nsleep [nocturnal panic attack]). The determination of whether panic attacks are expected\nor unexpected is made by the clinician, who makes this judgment based on a combination\nof careful questioning as to the sequence of events preceding or leading up to the attack\nand the individual’s own judgment of whether or not the attack seemed to occur for no ap-\nparent reason. Cultural interpretations may influence their determination as expected or\nunexpected. Culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, uncon-\ntrollable screaming or crying) may be seen; however, such symptoms should not count as\none of the four required symptoms. Panic attacks can occur in the context of any mental\ndisorder (e.g., anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, eating disorders,\nobsessive-compulsive and related disorders, personality disorders, psychotic disorders,\nsubstance use disorders) and some medical conditions (e.g., cardiac, respiratory, vestibu-\nlar, gastrointestinal), with the majority never meeting criteria for panic disorder. Recur-\nrent unexpected panic attacks are required for a diagnosis of panic disorder.\nAssociated Features\nOne type of unexpected panic attack is a nocturnal panic attack (i.e., waking from sleep in a\nstate of panic), which differs from panicking after fully waking from sleep. Panic attacks\nare related to a higher rate of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation even when comorbid-\nity and other suicide risk factors are taken into account.tacks typically are associated with greater morbidity (e.g., greater health care utilization,\nmore disability, poorer quality of life) than limited-symptom attacks.Panic attacks are associated with increased likelihood of various comorbid mental dis-\norders, including anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, impulse-\ncontrol disorders, and substance use disorders. Panic attacks are associated with increased\nlikelihood of later developing anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, bipolar disorders,\nand possibly other disorders.\nAgoraphobiaThe majority of individuals with agoraphobia also have other mental disorders. The most\nfrequent additional diagnoses are other anxiety disorders (e.g., specific phobias, panic dis-\norder, social anxiety disorder), depressive disorders (major depressive disorder), PTSD,\nand alcohol use disorder. Whereas other anxiety disorders (e.g., separation anxiety disor-\nder, specific phobias, panic disorder) frequently precede onset of agoraphobia, depressive\ndisorders and substance use disorders typically occur secondary to agoraphobia.\n222\nAnxiety Disorders\nGeneralized Anxiety DisorderIndividuals whose presentation meets criteria for generalized anxiety disorder are likely\nto have met, or currently meet, criteria for other anxiety and unipolar depressive disor-\nders. The neuroticism or emotional liability that underpins this pattern of comorbidity is\nassociated with temperamental antecedents and genetic and environmental risk factors\nshared between these disorders, although independent pathways are also possible. Co-\nmorbidity with substance use, conduct, psychotic, neurodevelopmental, and neurocogni-\ntive disorders is less common.\nSubstance/Medication-Induced\nAnxiety DisorderIndividuals with OCD often have other psychopathology. Many adults with the disorder\nhave a lifetime diagnosis of an anxiety disorder (76%; e.g., panic disorder, social anxiety\ndisorder, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia) or a depressive or bipolar disorder\n(63% for any depressive or bipolar disorder, with the most common being major depres-\nsive disorder [41%]). Onset of OCD is usually later than for most comorbid anxiety disor-\nders (with the exception of separation anxiety disorder) and PTSD but often precedes that\nof depressive disorders. Comorbid obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is also\ncommon in individuals with OCD (e.g., ranging from 23% to 32%).\nUp to 30% of individuals with OCD also have a lifetime tic disorder. A comorbid tic\ndisorder is most common in males with onset of OCD in childhood. These individuals\ntend to differ from those without a history of tic disorders in the themes of their OCD\nsymptoms, comorbidity, course, and pattern of familial transmission. A triad of OCD, tic\ndisorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder can also be seen in children.\nDisorders that occur more frequently in individuals with OCD than in those without\nthe disorder include several obsessive-compulsive and related disorders such as body\ndysmorphic disorder, trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), and excoriation (skin-pick-\ning) disorder. Finally, an association between OCD and some disorders characterized by\nimpulsivity, such as oppositional defiant disorder, has been reported.\nOCD is also much more common in individuals with certain other disorders than\nwould be expected based on its prevalence in the general population; when one of those\nother disorders is diagnosed, the individual should be assessed for OCD as well. For ex-\nample, in individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the prevalence of\nOCD is approximately 12%. Rates of OCD are also elevated in bipolar disorder; eating dis-\norders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa; and Tourette’s disorder.\nBody Dysmorphic DisorderMajor depressive disorder is the most common comorbid disorder, with onset usually af-\nter that of body dysmorphic disorder. Comorbid social anxiety disorder (social phobia),\nOCD, and substance-related disorders are also common.\nHoarding DisorderApproximately 75% of individuals with hoarding disorder have a comorbid mood or anx-\niety disorder. The most common comorbid conditions are major depressive disorder (up\nto 50% of cases), social anxiety disorder (social phobia), and generalized anxiety disorder.\nApproximately 20% of individuals with hoarding disorder also have symptoms that meetTrichotillomania is often accompanied by other mental disorders, most commonly major\ndepressive disorder and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder. Repetitive body-focused\nsymptoms other than hair pulling or skin picking (e.g. nail biting) occur in the majority of\nindividuals with trichotillomania and may deserve an additional diagnosis of other spec-\nified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (i.e., body-focused repetitive behavior\ndisorder).\nExcoriation (Skin-Picking) DisorderExcoriation disorder is often accompanied by other mental disorders. Such disorders in-\nclude OCD and trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), as well as major depressive dis-\norder. Repetitive body-focused symptoms other than skin picking and hair pulling (e.g.,\nnail biting) occur in many individuals with excoriation disorder and may deserve an ad-\nditional diagnosis of other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (i.e.,\nbody-focused repetitive behavior disorder).\nSubstance/Medication-Induced\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related DisorderConditions associated with neglect, including cognitive delays, language delays, and ste-\nreotypies, often co-occur with reactive attachment disorder. Medical conditions, such as\nsevere malnutrition, may accompany signs of the disorder. Depressive symptoms also\nmay co-occur with reactive attachment disorder.\nDisinhibited Social Engagement DisorderLimited research has examined the issue of disorders comorbid with disinhibited social\nengagement disorder. Conditions associated with neglect, including cognitive delays,\nlanguage delays, and stereotypies, may co-occur with disinhibited social engagement dis-\norder. In addition, children may be diagnosed with ADHD and disinhibited social engage-\nment disorder concurrently.\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder\n271\nPosttraumatic Stress DisorderIndividuals with PTSD are 80% more likely than those without PTSD to have symptoms\nthat meet diagnostic criteria for at least one other mental disorder (e.g., depressive, bipo-\nlar, anxiety, or substance use disorders). Comorbid substance use disorder and conduct\ndisorder are more common among males than among females. Among U.S. military per-\nsonnel and combat veterans who have been deployed to recent wars in Afghanistan and\nIraq, co-occurrence of PTSD and mild TBI is 48%. Although most young children with\nPTSD also have at least one other diagnosis, the patterns of comorbidity are different than\nin adults, with oppositional defiant disorder and separation anxiety disorder predominat-\ning. Finally, there is considerable comorbidity between PTSD and major neurocognitive\ndisorder and some overlapping symptoms between these disorders.\nAcute Stress DisorderAdjustment disorders can accompany most mental disorders and any medical disorder.\nAdjustment disorders can be diagnosed in addition to another mental disorder only if the\nlatter does not explain the particular symptoms that occur in reaction to the stressor. For\nexample, an individual may develop an adjustment disorder, with depressed mood, after\nlosing a job and at the same time have a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Or,\nan individual may have a depressive or bipolar disorder and an adjustment disorder as\nlong as the criteria for both are met. Adjustment disorders are common accompaniments\nof medical illness and may be the major psychological response to a medical disorder.\nOther Specified Trauma- and\nStressor-Related Disorder\n309.89 (F43.8)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a trauma- and\nstressor-related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,\noccupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full\ncriteria for any of the disorders in the trauma- and stressor-related disorders diagnostic\nclass. The other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder category is used in situa-\ntions in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presenta-\ntion does not meet the criteria for any specific trauma- and stressor-related disorder. This\nis done by recording “other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder” followed by\nthe specific reason (e.g., “persistent complex bereavement disorder”).\nExamples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation\ninclude the following:\n1. Adjustment-like disorders with delayed onset of symptoms that occur more than\n3 months after the stressor.\n2. Adjustment-like disorders with prolonged duration of more than 6 months with-\nout prolonged duration of stressor.\n3. Ataque de nervios: See “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the Appendix.\n4. Other cultural syndromes: See “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the Ap-\npendix.\n5. Persistent complex bereavement disorder: This disorder is characterized by severe\nand persistent grief and mourning reactions (see the chapter “Conditions for Further\nStudy”).\n290\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\nUnspecified Trauma- and\nStressor-Related Disorder\n309.9 (F43.9)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a trauma- and\nstressor-related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-\ncupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full cri-\nteria for any of the disorders in the trauma- and stressor-related disorders diagnostic class.\nThe unspecified trauma- or stressor-related disorder category is used in situations in which\nthe clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific\ntrauma- and stressor-related disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insuffi-\ncient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).\n291\nDissociative\nDisorders\nDissociative disorders are characterized by a disruption of and/or discontinuity\nin the normal integration of consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body\nrepresentation, motor control, and behavior. Dissociative symptoms can potentially dis-\nrupt every area of psychological functioning. This chapter includes dissociative identity\ndisorder, dissociative amnesia, depersonalization/derealization disorder, other specified\ndissociative disorder, and unspecified dissociative disorder.\nDissociative symptoms are experienced as a) unbidden intrusions into awareness and\nbehavior, with accompanying losses of continuity in subjective experience (i.e., ‘‘positive’’\ndissociative symptoms such as fragmentation of identity, depersonalization, and dereal-\nization) and/or b) inability to access information or to control mental functions that nor-\nmally are readily amenable to access or control (i.e., “negative’’ dissociative symptoms such\nas amnesia).\nThe dissociative disorders are frequently found in the aftermath of trauma, and many\nof the symptoms, including embarrassment and confusion about the symptoms or a desire\nto hide them, are influenced by the proximity to trauma. In DSM-5, the dissociative disor-\nders are placed next to, but are not part of, the trauma- and stressor-related disorders, re-\nflecting the close relationship between these diagnostic classes. Both acute stress disorder\nand posttraumatic stress disorder contain dissociative symptoms, such as amnesia, flash-\nbacks, numbing, and depersonalization/derealization.\nDepersonalization/derealization disorder is characterized by clinically significant persis-\ntent or recurrent depersonalization (i.e., experiences of unreality or detachment from one’s\nmind, self, or body) and/or derealization (i.e., experiences of unreality or detachment from\none’s surroundings). These alterations of experience are accompanied by intact reality\ntesting. There is no evidence of any distinction between individuals with predominantly\ndepersonalization versus derealization symptoms. Therefore, individuals with this disor-\nder can have depersonalization, derealization, or both.\nDissociative amnesia is characterized by an inability to recall autobiographical informa-\ntion. This amnesia may be localized (i.e., an event or period of time), selective (i.e., a specific\naspect of an event), or generalized (i.e., identity and life history). Dissociative amnesia is fun-\ndamentally an inability to recall autobiographical information that is inconsistent with nor-\nmal forgetting. It may or may not involve purposeful travel or bewildered wandering (i.e.,\nfugue). Although some individuals with amnesia promptly notice that they have “lost time”\nor that they have a gap in their memory, most individuals with dissociative disorders are ini-\ntially unaware of their amnesias. For them, awareness of amnesia occurs only when personal\nidentity is lost or when circumstances make these individuals aware that autobiographical\ninformation is missing (e.g., when they discover evidence of events they cannot recall or\nwhen others tell them or ask them about events they cannot recall). Until and unless this hap-\npens, these individuals have “amnesia for their amnesia.” Amnesia is experienced as an es-\nsential feature of dissociative amnesia; individuals may experience localized or selective\namnesia most commonly, or generalized amnesia rarely. Dissociative fugue is rare in per-\nsons with dissociative amnesia but common in dissociative identity disorder.\nDissociative identity disorder is characterized by a) the presence of two or more distinct\npersonality states or an experience of possession and b) recurrent episodes of amnesia. The\n292\nDissociative Disorders\nfragmentation of identity may vary with culture (e.g., possession-form presentations) and cir-\ncumstance. Thus, individuals may experience discontinuities in identity and memory that\nmay not be immediately evident to others or are obscured by attempts to hide dysfunction. In-\ndividuals with dissociative identity disorder experience a) recurrent, inexplicable intrusions\ninto their conscious functioning and sense of self (e.g., voices; dissociated actions and speech;\nintrusive thoughts, emotions, and impulses), b) alterations of sense of self (e.g., attitudes, pref-\nerences, and feeling like one’s body or actions are not one’s own), c) odd changes of perception\n(e.g., depersonalization or derealization, such as feeling detached from one’s body while cut-\nting), and d) intermittent functional neurological symptoms. Stress often produces transient\nexacerbation of dissociative symptoms that makes them more evident.\nThe residual category of other specified dissociative disorder has seven examples: chronic\nor recurrent mixed dissociative symptoms that approach, but fall short of, the diagnostic cri-\nteria for dissociative identity disorder; dissociative states secondary to brainwashing or\nthought reform; two acute presentations, of less than 1 month’s duration, of mixed dissociative\nsymptoms, one of which is also marked by the presence of psychotic symptoms; and three sin-\ngle-symptom dissociative presentations—dissociative trance, dissociative stupor or coma, and\nGanser’s syndrome (the giving of approximate and vague answers).\nDissociative Identity DisorderMany individuals with dissociative identity disorder present with a comorbid disorder. If\nnot assessed and treated specifically for the dissociative disorder, these individuals often\nreceive prolonged treatment for the comorbid diagnosis only, with limited overall treat-\nment response and resultant demoralization, and disability.\n298\nDissociative Disorders\nIndividuals with dissociative identity disorder usually exhibit a large number of co-\nmorbid disorders. In particular, most develop PTSD. Other disorders that are highly co-\nmorbid with dissociative identity disorder include depressive disorders, trauma- and\nstressor-related disorders, personality disorders (especially avoidant and borderline per-\nsonality disorders), conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder),\nsomatic symptom disorder, eating disorders, substance-related disorders, obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder, and sleep disorders. Dissociative alterations in identity, memory,\nand consciousness may affect the symptom presentation of comorbid disorders.\nDissociative AmnesiaAs dissociative amnesia begins to remit, a wide variety of affective phenomena may sur-\nface: dysphoria, grief, rage, shame, guilt, psychological conflict and turmoil, and suicidal\nand homicidal ideation, impulses, and acts. These individuals may have symptoms that\nthen meet diagnostic criteria for persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia); major de-\npressive disorder; other specified or unspecified depressive disorder; adjustment disor-\nder, with depressed mood; or adjustment disorder, with mixed disturbance of emotions\nand conduct. Many individuals with dissociative amnesia develop PTSD at some point\nduring their life, especially when the traumatic antecedents of their amnesia are brought\ninto conscious awareness.\nMany individuals with dissociative amnesia have symptoms that meet diagnostic cri-\nteria for a comorbid somatic symptom or related disorder (and vice versa), including so-\nmatic symptom disorder and conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom\ndisorder). Many individuals with dissociative amnesia have symptoms that meet diagnos-\ntic criteria for a personality disorder, especially dependent, avoidant, and borderline.\nDepersonalization/Derealization DisorderIn a convenience sample of adults recruited for a number of depersonalization research\nstudies, lifetime comorbidities were high for unipolar depressive disorder and for any\nanxiety disorder, with a significant proportion of the sample having both disorders. Comor-\nbidity with posttraumatic stress disorder was low. The three most commonly co-occurring\npersonality disorders were avoidant, borderline, and obsessive-compulsive.\nOther Specified Dissociative Disorder\n300.15 (F44.89)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a dissociative\ndisorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or\nother important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of\nthe disorders in the dissociative disorders diagnostic class. The other specified dissocia-\ntive disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate\nthe specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific disso-\nciative disorder. This is done by recording “other specified dissociative disorder” followed\nby the specific reason (e.g., “dissociative trance”).\nExamples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation\ninclude the following:\n1. Chronic and recurrent syndromes of mixed dissociative symptoms: This cate-\ngory includes identity disturbance associated with less-than-marked discontinuities in\nsense of self and agency, or alterations of identity or episodes of possession in an in-\ndividual who reports no dissociative amnesia.\n2. Identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion: Individ-\nuals who have been subjected to intense coercive persuasion (e.g., brainwashing,\nthought reform, indoctrination while captive, torture, long-term political imprisonment,\nrecruitment by sects/cults or by terror organizations) may present with prolonged\nchanges in, or conscious questioning of, their identity.\n3. Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events: This category is for acute, tran-\nsient conditions that typically last less than 1 month, and sometimes only a few hours\nor days. These conditions are characterized by constriction of consciousness; deper-\nsonalization; derealization; perceptual disturbances (e.g., time slowing, macropsia);\nUnspecified Dissociative Disorder\n307\nmicro-amnesias; transient stupor; and/or alterations in sensory-motor functioning (e.g.,\nanalgesia, paralysis).\n4. Dissociative trance: This condition is characterized by an acute narrowing or com-\nplete loss of awareness of immediate surroundings that manifests as profound unre-\nsponsiveness or insensitivity to environmental stimuli. The unresponsiveness may be\naccompanied by minor stereotyped behaviors (e.g., finger movements) of which the in-\ndividual is unaware and/or that he or she cannot control, as well as transient paralysis\nor loss of consciousness. The dissociative trance is not a normal part of a broadly ac-\ncepted collective cultural or religious practice.\nUnspecified Dissociative Disorder\n300.15 (F44.9)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a dissociative\ndisorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or\nother important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of\nthe disorders in the dissociative disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified dissociative\ndisorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the rea-\nson that the criteria are not met for a specific dissociative disorder, and includes presen-\ntations for which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g.,\nin emergency room settings).\nThis page intentionally left blank\n309\nSomatic Symptom and\nRelated Disorders\nSomatic symptom disorder and other disorders with prominent somatic symp-\ntoms constitute a new category in DSM-5 called somatic symptom and related disorders. This\nchapter includes the diagnoses of somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, con-\nversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder), psychological factors affect-\ning other medical conditions, factitious disorder, other specified somatic symptom and\nrelated disorder, and unspecified somatic symptom and related disorder. All of the disor-\nders in this chapter share a common feature: the prominence of somatic symptoms associ-\nated with significant distress and impairment. Individuals with disorders with prominent\nsomatic symptoms are commonly encountered in primary care and other medical settings\nbut are less commonly encountered in psychiatric and other mental health settings. These\nreconceptualized diagnoses, based on a reorganization of DSM-IV somatoform disorder di-\nagnoses, are more useful for primary care and other medical (nonpsychiatric) clinicians.\nThe major diagnosis in this diagnostic class, somatic symptom disorder, emphasizes\ndiagnosis made on the basis of positive symptoms and signs (distressing somatic symp-\ntoms plus abnormal thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in response to these symptoms)\nrather than the absence of a medical explanation for somatic symptoms. A distinctive char-\nacteristic of many individuals with somatic symptom disorder is not the somatic symp-\ntoms per se, but instead the way they present and interpret them. Incorporating affective,\ncognitive, and behavioral components into the criteria for somatic symptom disorder pro-\nvides a more comprehensive and accurate reflection of the true clinical picture than can be\nachieved by assessing the somatic complaints alone.\nThe principles behind the changes in the somatic symptom and related diagnoses from\nDSM-IV are crucial in understanding the DSM-5 diagnoses. The DSM-IV term somatoform\ndisorders was confusing and is replaced by somatic symptom and related disorders. In DSM-IV\nthere was a great deal of overlap across the somatoform disorders and a lack of clarity\nabout the boundaries of diagnoses. Although individuals with these disorders primarily\npresent in medical rather than mental health settings, nonpsychiatric physicians found the\nDSM-IV somatoform diagnoses difficult to understand and use. The current DSM-5 clas-\nsification recognizes this overlap by reducing the total number of disorders as well as their\nsubcategories.\nThe previous criteria overemphasized the centrality of medically unexplained symptoms.\nSuch symptoms are present to various degrees, particularly in conversion disorder, but so-\nmatic symptom disorders can also accompany diagnosed medical disorders. The reli-\nability of determining that a somatic symptom is medically unexplained is limited, and\ngrounding a diagnosis on the absence of an explanation is problematic and reinforces\nmind-body dualism. It is not appropriate to give an individual a mental disorder diagnosis\nsolely because a medical cause cannot be demonstrated. Furthermore, the presence of a\nmedical diagnosis does not exclude the possibility of a comorbid mental disorder, includ-\ning a somatic symptom and related disorder. Perhaps because of the predominant focus\non lack of medical explanation, individuals regarded these diagnoses as pejorative and de-\nmeaning, implying that their physical symptoms were not “real.” The new classification\ndefines the major diagnosis, somatic symptom disorder, on the basis of positive symptoms\n(distressing somatic symptoms plus abnormal thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in response\n310\nSomatic Symptom and Related Disorders\nto these symptoms). However, medically unexplained symptoms remain a key feature in\nconversion disorder and pseudocyesis (other specified somatic symptom and related dis-\norder) because it is possible to demonstrate definitively in such disorders that the symp-\ntoms are not consistent with medical pathophysiology.\nIt is important to note that some other mental disorders may initially manifest with pri-\nmarily somatic symptoms (e.g., major depressive disorder, panic disorder). Such diagno-\nses may account for the somatic symptoms, or they may occur alongside one of the somatic\nsymptom and related disorders in this chapter. There is also considerable medical comor-\nbidity among somatizing individuals. Although somatic symptoms are frequently associ-\nated with psychological distress and psychopathology, some somatic symptom and\nrelated disorders can arise spontaneously, and their causes can remain obscure. Anxiety\ndisorders and depressive disorders may accompany somatic symptom and related disor-\nders. The somatic component adds severity and complexity to depressive and anxiety dis-\norders and results in higher severity, functional impairment, and even refractoriness to\ntraditional treatments. In rare instances, the degree of preoccupation may be so severe as\nto warrant consideration of a delusional disorder diagnosis.\nA number of factors may contribute to somatic symptom and related disorders. These\ninclude genetic and biological vulnerability (e.g., increased sensitivity to pain), early trau-\nmatic experiences (e.g., violence, abuse, deprivation), and learning (e.g., attention ob-\ntained from illness, lack of reinforcement of nonsomatic expressions of distress), as well as\ncultural/social norms that devalue and stigmatize psychological suffering as compared\nwith physical suffering. Differences in medical care across cultures affect the presentation,\nrecognition, and management of these somatic presentations. Variations in symptom pre-\nsentation are likely the result of the interaction of multiple factors within cultural con-\ntexts that affect how individuals identify and classify bodily sensations, perceive illness,\nand seek medical attention for them. Thus, somatic presentations can be viewed as expres-\nsions of personal suffering inserted in a cultural and social context.\nAll of these disorders are characterized by the prominent focus on somatic concerns\nand their initial presentation mainly in medical rather than mental health care settings. So-\nmatic symptom disorder offers a more clinically useful method of characterizing individ-\nuals who may have been considered in the past for a diagnosis of somatization disorder.\nFurthermore, approximately 75% of individuals previously diagnosed with hypochon-\ndriasis are subsumed under the diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder. However, about\n25% of individuals with hypochondriasis have high health anxiety in the absence of so-\nmatic symptoms, and many such individuals’ symptoms would not qualify for an anxiety\ndisorder diagnosis. The DSM-5 diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder is for this latter group\nof individuals. Illness anxiety disorder can be considered either in this diagnostic section\nor as an anxiety disorder. Because of the strong focus on somatic concerns, and because ill-\nness anxiety disorder is most often encountered in medical settings, for utility it is listed\nwith the somatic symptom and related disorders. In conversion disorder, the essential fea-\nture is neurological symptoms that are found, after appropriate neurological assessment,\nto be incompatible with neurological pathophysiology. Psychological factors affecting\nother medical conditions is also included in this chapter. Its essential feature is the pres-\nence of one or more clinically significant psychological or behavioral factors that adversely\naffect a medical condition by increasing the risk for suffering, death, or disability. Like the\nother somatic symptom and related disorders, factitious disorder embodies persistent\nproblems related to illness perception and identity. In the great majority of reported cases\nof factitious disorder, both imposed on self and imposed on another, individuals present\nwith somatic symptoms and medical disease conviction. Consequently, DSM-5 factitious\ndisorder is included among the somatic symptom and related disorders. Other specified\nsomatic symptom and related disorder and unspecified somatic symptom and related dis-\norder include conditions for which some, but not all, of the criteria for somatic symptom\ndisorder or illness anxiety disorder are met, as well as pseudocyesis.\nSomatic Symptom Disorder\n311\nSomatic Symptom DisorderSomatic symptom disorder is associated with high rates of comorbidity with medical dis-\norders as well as anxiety and depressive disorders. When a concurrent medical illness is\nIllness Anxiety Disorder\n315\npresent, the degree of impairment is more marked than would be expected from the phys-\nical illness alone. When an individual’s symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for somatic\nsymptom disorder, the disorder should be diagnosed; however, in view of the frequent co-\nmorbidity, especially with anxiety and depressive disorders, evidence for these concur-\nrent diagnoses should be sought.\nIllness Anxiety DisorderBecause illness anxiety disorder is a new disorder, exact comorbidities are unknown. Hy-\npochondriasis co-occurs with anxiety disorders (in particular, generalized anxiety disor-\nder, panic disorder, and OCD) and depressive disorders. Approximately two-thirds of\nindividuals with illness anxiety disorder are likely to have at least one other comorbid ma-\njor mental disorder. Individuals with illness anxiety disorder may have an elevated risk\nfor somatic symptom disorder and personality disorders.\nConversion Disorder\n(Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder)Anxiety disorders, especially panic disorder, and depressive disorders commonly co-occur\nwith conversion disorder. Somatic symptom disorder may co-occur as well. Psychosis, sub-\nstance use disorder, and alcohol misuse are uncommon. Personality disorders are more\ncommon in individuals with conversion disorder than in the general population. Neuro-\nlogical or other medical conditions commonly coexist with conversion disorder as well.\n322\nSomatic Symptom and Related Disorders\nPsychological Factors Affecting\nOther Medical ConditionsBy definition, the diagnosis of psychological factors affecting other medical conditions entails\na relevant psychological or behavioral syndrome or trait and a comorbid medical condition.\nFactitious DisorderDisorders most commonly comorbid with pica are autism spectrum disorder and intellec-\ntual disability (intellectual developmental disorder), and, to a lesser degree, schizophrenia\nand obsessive-compulsive disorder. Pica can be associated with trichotillomania (hair-\npulling disorder) and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder. In comorbid presentations, the\nhair or skin is typically ingested. Pica can also be associated with avoidant/restrictive food\nintake disorder, particularly in individuals with a strong sensory component to their pre-\nsentation. When an individual is known to have pica, assessment should include con-\nsideration of the possibility of gastrointestinal complications, poisoning, infection, and\nnutritional deficiency.\n332\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\nRumination DisorderRegurgitation with associated rumination can occur in the context of a concurrent medical\ncondition or another mental disorder (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder). When the regur-\ngitation occurs in this context, a diagnosis of rumination disorder is appropriate only when\nthe severity of the disturbance exceeds that routinely associated with such conditions or\ndisorders and warrants additional clinical attention.\n334\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\nAvoidant/Restrictive Food Intake DisorderThe most commonly observed disorders comorbid with avoidant/restrictive food intake\ndisorder are anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and neurodevelopmental\ndisorders (specifically autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disor-\nder, and intellectual disability [intellectual developmental disorder]).\nAnorexia NervosaBipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders commonly co-occur with anorexia nervosa.\nMany individuals with anorexia nervosa report the presence of either an anxiety disorder\nBulimia Nervosa\n345\nor symptoms prior to onset of their eating disorder. OCD is described in some individuals\nwith anorexia nervosa, especially those with the restricting type. Alcohol use disorder and\nother substance use disorders may also be comorbid with anorexia nervosa, especially\namong those with the binge-eating/purging type.\nBulimia Nervosamost experiencing at least one other mental disorder and many experiencing multiple co-\nmorbidities. Comorbidity is not limited to any particular subset but rather occurs across a\nwide range of mental disorders. There is an increased frequency of depressive symptoms\n(e.g., low self-esteem) and bipolar and depressive disorders (particularly depressive dis-\norders) in individuals with bulimia nervosa. In many individuals, the mood disturbance\nbegins at the same time as or following the development of bulimia nervosa, and individ-\nuals often ascribe their mood disturbances to the bulimia nervosa. However, in some in-\ndividuals, the mood disturbance clearly precedes the development of bulimia nervosa.\nThere may also be an increased frequency of anxiety symptoms (e.g., fear of social situa-\ntions) or anxiety disorders. These mood and anxiety disturbances frequently remit follow-\n350\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\ning effective treatment of the bulimia nervosa. The lifetime prevalence of substance use,\nparticularly alcohol or stimulant use, is at least 30% among individuals with bulimia ner-\nvosa. Stimulant use often begins in an attempt to control appetite and weight. A substan-\ntial percentage of individuals with bulimia nervosa also have personality features that\nmeet criteria for one or more personality disorders, most frequently borderline personality\ndisorder.\nBinge-Eating DisorderBinge-eating disorder is associated with significant psychiatric comorbidity that is com-\nparable to that of bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa. The most common comorbid dis-\norders are bipolar disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and, to a lesser\ndegree, substance use disorders. The psychiatric comorbidity is linked to the severity of\nbinge eating and not to the degree of obesity.\nOther Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder\n307.59 (F50.8)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a feeding and\neating disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupation-\nal, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for\nany of the disorders in the feeding and eating disorders diagnostic class. The other spec-\nified feeding or eating disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses\nto communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any\nspecific feeding and eating disorder. This is done by recording “other specified feeding or\neating disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “bulimia nervosa of low frequency”).\nExamples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation\ninclude the following:\n1. Atypical anorexia nervosa: All of the criteria for anorexia nervosa are met, except\nthat despite significant weight loss, the individual’s weight is within or above the normal\nrange.\n2. Bulimia nervosa (of low frequency and/or limited duration): All of the criteria for\nbulimia nervosa are met, except that the binge eating and inappropriate compensatory\nbehaviors occur, on average, less than once a week and/or for less than 3 months.\n3. Binge-eating disorder (of low frequency and/or limited duration): All of the criteria\nfor binge-eating disorder are met, except that the binge eating occurs, on average, less\nthan once a week and/or for less than 3 months.\n4. Purging disorder: Recurrent purging behavior to influence weight or shape (e.g., self-\ninduced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications) in the absence\nof binge eating.\n354\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\n5. Night eating syndrome: Recurrent episodes of night eating, as manifested by eating\nafter awakening from sleep or by excessive food consumption after the evening meal.\nThere is awareness and recall of the eating. The night eating is not better explained by\nexternal influences such as changes in the individual’s sleep-wake cycle or by local so-\ncial norms. The night eating causes significant distress and/or impairment in function-\ning. The disordered pattern of eating is not better explained by binge-eating disorder\nor another mental disorder, including substance use, and is not attributable to another\nmedical disorder or to an effect of medication.\nUnspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder\n307.50 (F50.9)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a feeding and\neating disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupation-\nal, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for\nany of the disorders in the feeding and eating disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified\nfeeding or eating disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not\nto specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific feeding and eating disorder,\nand includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more spe-\ncific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).\n355\nElimination\nDisorders\nElimination disorders all involve the inappropriate elimination of urine or feces\nand are usually first diagnosed in childhood or adolescence. This group of disorders in-\ncludes enuresis, the repeated voiding of urine into inappropriate places, and encopresis, the\nrepeated passage of feces into inappropriate places. Subtypes are provided to differentiate\nnocturnal from diurnal (i.e., during waking hours) voiding for enuresis and the presence or\nabsence of constipation and overflow incontinence for encopresis. Although there are min-\nimum age requirements for diagnosis of both disorders, these are based on developmental\nage and not solely on chronological age. Both disorders may be voluntary or involuntary.\nAlthough these disorders typically occur separately, co-occurrence may also be observed.\nEnuresisAlthough most children with enuresis do not have a comorbid mental disorder, the prevalence\nof comorbid behavioral symptoms is higher in children with enuresis than in children without\nenuresis. Developmental delays, including speech, language, learning, and motor skills\ndelays, are also present in a portion of children with enuresis. Encopresis, sleepwalking, and\nsleep terror disorder may be present. Urinary tract infections are more common in children\nwith enuresis, especially the diurnal subtype, than in those who are continent.\nEncopresisUrinary tract infections can be comorbid with encopresis and are more common in females.\nOther Specified Elimination Disorder\n\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an elimination\ndisorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or\nother important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of\nthe disorders in the elimination disorders diagnostic class. The other specified elimination\ndisorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the\nspecific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific elimination\ndisorder. This is done by recording “other specified elimination disorder” followed by the\nspecific reason (e.g., “low-frequency enuresis”).\nCoding note: Code 788.39 (N39.498) for other specified elimination disorder with urinary\nsymptoms; 787.60 (R15.9) for other specified elimination disorder with fecal symptoms.\n360\nElimination Disorders\nUnspecified Elimination Disorder\n\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an elimination\ndisorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or\nother important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of\nthe disorders in the elimination disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified elimination dis-\norder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason\nthat the criteria are not met for a specific elimination disorder, and includes presentations\nin which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emer-\ngency room settings).\nCoding note: Code 788.30 (R32) for unspecified elimination disorder with urinary symp-\ntoms; 787.60 (R15.9) for unspecified elimination disorder with fecal symptoms.\n361\nSleep-Wake\nDisorders\nThe DSM-5 classification of sleep-wake disorders is intended for use by general\nmental health and medical clinicians (those caring for adult, geriatric, and pediatric pa-\ntients). Sleep-wake disorders encompass 10 disorders or disorder groups: insomnia disor-\nder, hypersomnolence disorder, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian\nrhythm sleep-wake disorders, non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep arousal disorders,\nnightmare disorder, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syn-\ndrome, and substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. Individuals with these disor-\nders typically present with sleep-wake complaints of dissatisfaction regarding the quality,\ntiming, and amount of sleep. Resulting daytime distress and impairment are core features\nshared by all of these sleep-wake disorders.\nThe organization of this chapter is designed to facilitate differential diagnosis of sleep-\nwake complaints and to clarify when referral to a sleep specialist is appropriate for further\nassessment and treatment planning. The DSM-5 sleep disorders nosology uses a simple,\nclinically useful approach, while also reflecting scientific advances in epidemiology, ge-\nnetics, pathophysiology, assessment, and interventions research since DSM-IV. In some\ncases (e.g., insomnia disorder), a “lumping” approach has been adopted, whereas in oth-\ners (e.g., narcolepsy), a “splitting” approach has been taken, reflecting the availability of\nvalidators derived from epidemiological, neurobiological, and interventions research.\nSleep disorders are often accompanied by depression, anxiety, and cognitive changes\nthat must be addressed in treatment planning and management. Furthermore, persistent\nsleep disturbances (both insomnia and excessive sleepiness) are established risk factors for\nthe subsequent development of mental illnesses and substance use disorders. They may\nalso represent a prodromal expression of an episode of mental illness, allowing the possi-\nbility of early intervention to preempt or to attenuate a full-blown episode.\nThe differential diagnosis of sleep-wake complaints necessitates a multidimensional\napproach, with consideration of possibly coexisting medical and neurological conditions.\nCoexisting clinical conditions are the rule, not the exception. Sleep disturbances furnish a\nclinically useful indicator of medical and neurological conditions that often coexist with\ndepression and other common mental disorders. Prominent among these comorbidities\nare breathing-related sleep disorders, disorders of the heart and lungs (e.g., congestive\nheart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), neurodegenerative disorders (e.g.,\nAlzheimer’s disease), and disorders of the musculoskeletal system (e.g., osteoarthritis).\nThese disorders not only may disturb sleep but also may themselves be worsened during\nsleep (e.g., prolonged apneas or electrocardiographic arrhythmias during REM sleep; con-\nfusional arousals in patients with dementing illness; seizures in persons with complex\npartial seizures). REM sleep behavior disorder is often an early indicator of neurodegen-\nerative disorders (alpha synucleinopathies) like Parkinson’s disease. For all of these rea-\nsons—related to differential diagnosis, clinical comorbidity, and facilitation of treatment\nplanning—sleep disorders are included in DSM-5.\nThe approach taken to the classification of sleep-wake disorders in DSM-5 can be under-\nstood within the context of “lumping versus splitting.” DSM-IV represented an effort to\nsimplify sleep-wake disorders classification and thus aggregated diagnoses under broader,\nless differentiated labels. At the other pole, the International Classification of Sleep Disorders,\n362\nSleep-Wake Disorders\n2nd Edition (ICSD-2) elaborated numerous diagnostic subtypes. DSM-IV was prepared for\nuse by mental health and general medical clinicians who are not experts in sleep medicine.\nICSD-2 reflected the science and opinions of the sleep specialist community and was pre-\npared for use by specialists.\nThe weight of available evidence supports the superior performance characteristics\n(interrater reliability, as well as convergent, discriminant, and face validity) of simpler, less-\ndifferentiated approaches to diagnosis of sleep-wake disorders. The text accompanying\neach set of diagnostic criteria provides linkages to the corresponding disorders included in\nICSD-2. The DSM-5 sleep-wake disorders classification also specifies corresponding non-\npsychiatric listings (e.g., neurology codes) from the International Classification of Diseases\n(ICD).\nThe field of sleep disorders medicine has progressed in this direction since the publi-\ncation of DSM-IV. The use of biological validators is now embodied in the DSM-5 classi-\nfication of sleep-wake disorders, particularly for disorders of excessive sleepiness, such as\nnarcolepsy; for breathing-related sleep disorders, for which formal sleep studies (i.e.,\npolysomnography) are indicated; and for restless legs syndrome, which can often coexist\nwith periodic limb movements during sleep, detectable via polysomnography.\nInsomnia DisorderInsomnia is a common comorbidity of many medical conditions, including diabetes, cor-\nonary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arthritis, fibromyalgia, and\nother chronic pain conditions. The risk relationship appears to be bidirectional: insomnia\nincreases the risk of medical conditions, and medical problems increase the risk of insom-\nnia. The direction of the relationship is not always clear and may change over time; for this\nreason, comorbid insomnia is the preferred terminology in the presence of coexisting in-\nsomnia with another medical condition (or mental disorder).\nIndividuals with insomnia disorder frequently have a comorbid mental disorder, par-\nticularly bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders. Persistent insomnia represents a risk\nfactor or an early symptom of subsequent bipolar, depressive, anxiety, and substance use\ndisorders. Individuals with insomnia may misuse medications or alcohol to help with\nnighttime sleep, anxiolytics to combat tension or anxiety, and caffeine or other stimulants\nto combat excessive fatigue. In addition to worsening the insomnia, this type of substance\nuse may in some cases progress to a substance use disorder.\nRelationship to International Classification of\nSleep Disorders\nThere are several distinct insomnia phenotypes relating to the perceived source of the in-\nsomnia that are recognized by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition\n(ICSD-2). These include psychophysiological insomnia, idiopathic insomnia, sleep-state mispercep-\ntion, and inadequate sleep hygiene. Despite their clinical appeal and heuristic value, there is\nlimited evidence to support these distinct phenotypes.\nHypersomnolence DisorderHypersomnolence can be associated with depressive disorders, bipolar disorders (during a\ndepressive episode), and major depressive disorder, with seasonal pattern. Many individu-\nals with hypersomnolence disorder have symptoms of depression that may meet criteria for\na depressive disorder. This presentation may be related to the psychosocial consequences of\npersistent increased sleep need. Individuals with hypersomnolence disorder are also at\nrisk for substance-related disorders, particularly related to self-medication with stimulants.\nThis general lack of specificity may contribute to very heterogeneous profiles among indi-\nviduals whose symptoms meet the same diagnostic criteria for hypersomnolence disorder.\nNeurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and mul-\ntiple system atrophy, may also be associated with hypersomnolence.\nRelationship to International Classification of\nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), differentiates nineNarcolepsy can co-occur with bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders, and in rare cases\nwith schizophrenia. Narcolepsy is also associated with increased body mass index or obe-\n378\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nsity, especially when the narcolepsy is untreated. Rapid weight gain is common in young\nchildren with a sudden disease onset. Comorbid sleep apnea should be considered if there\nis a sudden aggravation of preexisting narcolepsy.\nRelationship to International Classification of\nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), differentiates fiveSystemic hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, diabetes, and increased\nmortality are consistently associated with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Risk esti-\nmates vary from 30% to as much as 300% for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea. Evidence of pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure (e.g., cor pulmo-\nnale, ankle edema, hepatic congestion) are rare in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and\nwhen present indicate either very severe disease or associated hypoventilation or cardio-\npulmonary comorbidities. Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea also may occur with in-\ncreased frequency in association with a number of medical or neurological conditions (e.g.,\ncerebrovascular disease, Parkinson’s disease). Physical findings reflect the co-occurrence of\nthese conditions.\nAs many as one-third of individuals referred for evaluation of obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea report symptoms of depression, with as many of 10% having depression scores\nconsistent with moderate to severe depression. Severity of obstructive sleep apnea hypop-\nnea, as measured by the apnea hypopnea index, has been found to be correlated with se-\nverity of symptoms of depression. This association may be stronger in males than in\nfemales.\nRelationship to International Classification of\nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), differentiates 11 sub-\ntypes of “sleep-related breathing disorders,” including primary central sleep apnea, ob-\nstructive sleep apnea, and sleep-related hypoventilation.\nCentral Sleep ApneaCentral sleep apnea disorders are frequently present in users of long-acting opioids, such\nas methadone. Individuals taking these medications have a sleep-related breathing disor-\nder that could contribute to sleep disturbances and symptoms such as sleepiness, confu-\nsion, and depression. While the individual is asleep, breathing patterns such as central\napneas, periodic apneas, and ataxic breathing may be observed. Obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea may coexist with central sleep apnea, and features consistent with this condi-\ntion can also be present (see “Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea” earlier in this chapter).\nCheyne-Stokes breathing is more commonly observed in association with conditions that\ninclude heart failure, stroke, and renal failure and is seen more frequently in individuals\nwith atrial fibrillation. Individuals with Cheyne-Stokes breathing are more likely to be\nolder, to be male, and to have lower weight than individuals with obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea.\nSleep-Related Hypoventilation\n387\nSleep-Related HypoventilationSleep-related hypoventilation often occurs in association with a pulmonary disorder (e.g., in-\nterstitial lung disease, COPD), with a neuromuscular or chest wall disorder (e.g., muscular\ndystrophies, post-polio syndrome, cervical spinal cord injury, obesity, kyphoscoliosis), or,\n390\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nmost relevant to the mental health provider, with medication use (e.g., benzodiazepines, opi-\nates). Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation often occurs in association with autonomic\ndysfunction and may occur in association with Hirschsprung’s disease. COPD, a disorder of\nlower airway obstruction usually associated with cigarette smoking, can result in sleep-\nrelated hypoventilation and hypoxemia. The presence of coexisting obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea is thought to exacerbate hypoxemia and hypercapnia during sleep and wakeful-\nness. The relationship between congenital central alveolar hypoventilation and idiopathic\nsleep-related hypoventilation is unclear; in some individuals, idiopathic sleep-related hy-\npoventilation may represent cases of late-onset congenital central alveolar hypoventilation.\nRelationship to International Classification of\nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), combines sleep-\nrelated hypoventilation and sleep-related hypoxemia under the category of sleep-related\nhypoventilation/hypoxemic syndromes. This approach to classification reflects the fre-\nquent co-occurrence of disorders that lead to hypoventilation and hypoxemia. In contrast,\nthe classification used in DSM-5 reflects evidence that there are distinct sleep-related\npathogenetic processes leading to hypoventilation.\nCircadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake DisordersDelayed sleep phase type is strongly associated with depression, personality disorder, and\nsomatic symptom disorder or illness anxiety disorder. In addition, comorbid sleep disor-\nders, such as insomnia disorder, restless legs syndrome, and sleep apnea, as well as depres-\nsive and bipolar disorders and anxiety disorders, can exacerbate symptoms of insomnia\nand excessive sleepiness. Delayed sleep phase type may overlap with another circadian\nrhythm sleep-wake disorder, non-24-hour sleep-wake type. Sighted individuals with non-\n24-hour sleep-wake type disorder commonly also have a history of delayed circadian sleep\nphase.\nCircadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders\n393\nAdvanced Sleep Phase TypeMedical conditions and mental disorders with the symptom of early morning awakening,\nsuch as insomnia, can co-occur with the advance sleep phase type.\nIrregular Sleep-Wake TypeIrregular sleep-wake type is often comorbid with neurodegenerative and neurodevelop-\nmental disorders, such as major neurocognitive disorder, intellectual disability (intellec-\ntual developmental disorder), and traumatic brain injury. It is also comorbid with other\nmedical conditions and mental disorders in which there is social isolation and/or lack of\nlight and structured activities.\nNon-24-Hour Sleep-Wake TypeBlindness is often comorbid with non-24-hour sleep-wake type, as are depressive and bi-\npolar disorders with social isolation.\nShift Work TypeShift work type has been associated with increased alcohol use disorder, other substance\nuse disorders, and depression. A variety of physical health disorders (e.g., gastrointestinal\ndisorders, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer) have been found to be associated with\nprolonged exposure to shift work.\nRelationship to International Classification of\nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), differentiates nine\ncircadian rhythm sleep disorders, including jet lag type.\nNon–Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal Disorders\n399\nParasomnias\nParasomnias are disorders characterized by abnormal behavioral, experiential, or physio-\nlogical events occurring in association with sleep, specific sleep stages, or sleep-wake tran-\nsitions. The most common parasomnias—non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep\narousal disorders and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder—represent ad-\nmixtures of wakefulness and NREM sleep and wakefulness and REM sleep, respectively.\nThese conditions serve as a reminder that sleep and wakefulness are not mutually exclu-\nsive and that sleep is not necessarily a global, whole-brain phenomenon.\nNon–Rapid Eye Movement\nSleep Arousal DisordersIn adults, there is an association between sleepwalking and major depressive episodes and\nobsessive-compulsive disorder. Children or adults with sleep terrors may have elevated\nscores for depression and anxiety on personality inventories.\n404\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nRelationship to International Classification of\nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition, includes “confusional\narousal” as a NREM sleep arousal disorder.\nNightmare DisorderNightmares may be comorbid with several medical conditions, including coronary heart\ndisease, cancer, parkinsonism, and pain, and can accompany medical treatments, such as he-\nmodialysis, or withdrawal from medications or substances of abuse. Nightmares frequently\nare comorbid with other mental disorders, including PTSD; insomnia disorder; schizophrenia;\npsychosis; mood, anxiety, adjustment, and personality disorders; and grief during be-\nreavement. A concurrent nightmare disorder diagnosis should only be considered when in-\ndependent clinical attention is warranted (i.e., Criteria A–C are met). Otherwise, no separate\ndiagnosis is necessary. These conditions should be listed under the appropriate comorbid\ncategory specifier. However, nightmare disorder may be diagnosed as a separate disorder in\nindividuals with PTSD if the nightmares are temporally unrelated to PTSD (i.e., preceding\nother PTSD symptoms or persisting after other PTSD symptoms have resolved).\nNightmares are normally characteristic of REM sleep behavior disorder, PTSD, and acute\nstress disorder, but nightmare disorder may be independently coded if nightmares preceded\nthe condition and their frequency or severity necessitates independent clinical attention. The\nlatter may be determined by asking whether nightmares were a problem before onset of the\nother disorder and whether they continued after other symptoms had remitted.\nRelationship to International Classification of\nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), presents similar di-\nagnostic criteria for nightmare disorder.\nRapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior DisorderREM sleep behavior disorder is present concurrently in approximately 30% of patients\nwith narcolepsy. When it occurs in narcolepsy, the demographics reflect the younger age\nrange of narcolepsy, with equal frequency in males and females. Based on findings from\nindividuals presenting to sleep clinics, most individuals (>50%) with initially “idiopathic”\nREM sleep behavior disorder will eventually develop a neurodegenerative disease—most\nnotably, one of the synucleinopathies (Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy, or\nmajor or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies). REM sleep behavior disorder\noften predates any other sign of these disorders by many years (often more than a decade).\nRelationship to International Classification of\nSleep Disorders\nREM sleep behavior disorder is virtually identical to REM sleep behavior disorder in the\nInternational Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2).\nRestless Legs SyndromeDepressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and attentional disorders are commonly comor-\nbid with RLS and are discussed in the section “Functional Consequences of Restless Legs\nSyndrome.” The main medical disorder comorbid with RLS is cardiovascular disease.\nThere may be an association with numerous other medical disorders, including hyperten-\nsion, narcolepsy, migraine, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, peripheral neuropathy,\nobstructive sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, fibromyalgia, osteoporosis, obesity, thyroid\ndisease, and cancer. Iron deficiency, pregnancy, and chronic renal failure are also comor-\nbid with RLS.\nRelationship to International Classification of\nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), presents similar diag-\nnostic criteria for RLS but does not contain a criterion specifying frequency or duration of\nsymptoms.\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Sleep DisorderSee the “Comorbidity” sections for other sleep disorders in this chapter, including insom-\nnia, hypersomnolence, central sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoventilation, and circadian\nrhythm sleep-wake disorders, shift work type.\nRelationship to International Classification of\nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), lists sleep disorders\n“due to drug or substance” under their respective phenotypes (e.g., insomnia, hypersomnia).\nOther Specified Insomnia Disorder\n780.52 (G47.09)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of insomnia disorder\nthat cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important\nareas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for insomnia disorder or any\nof the disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class. The other specified insomnia dis-\norder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific\nreason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for insomnia disorder or any specific\nsleep-wake disorder. This is done by recording “other specified insomnia disorder” followed by\nthe specific reason (e.g., “brief insomnia disorder”).\nExamples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation\ninclude the following:\n1. Brief insomnia disorder: Duration is less than 3 months.\n2. Restricted to nonrestorative sleep: Predominant complaint is nonrestorative sleep\nunaccompanied by other sleep symptoms such as difficulty falling asleep or remaining\nasleep.\nUnspecified Insomnia Disorder\n780.52 (G47.00)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of insomnia disor-\nder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other\nimportant areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for insomnia dis-\norder or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified\nOther Specified Hypersomnolence Disorder\n421\ninsomnia disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify\nthe reason that the criteria are not met for insomnia disorder or a specific sleep-wake dis-\norder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more\nspecific diagnosis.\nOther Specified Hypersomnolence Disorder\n780.54 (G47.19)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of hypersomno-\nlence disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupation-\nal, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for\nhypersomnolence disorder or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic\nclass. The other specified hypersomnolence disorder category is used in situations in\nwhich the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does\nnot meet the criteria for hypersomnolence disorder or any specific sleep-wake disorder.\nThis is done by recording “other specified hypersomnolence disorder” followed by the spe-\ncific reason (e.g., “brief-duration hypersomnolence,” as in Kleine-Levin syndrome).\nUnspecified Hypersomnolence Disorder\n780.54 (G47.10)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of hypersomno-\nlence disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupation-\nal, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for\nhypersomnolence disorder or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic\nclass. The unspecified hypersomnolence disorder category is used in situations in which\nthe clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for hypersom-\nnolence disorder or a specific sleep-wake disorder, and includes presentations in which\nthere is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.\nOther Specified Sleep-Wake Disorder\n780.59 (G47.8)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a sleep-wake\ndisorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or\nother important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of\nthe disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class and do not qualify for a diagno-\nsis of other specified insomnia disorder or other specified hypersomnolence disorder. The\nother specified sleep-wake disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician\nchooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the\ncriteria for any specific sleep-wake disorder. This is done by recording “other specified\nsleep-wake disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “repeated arousals during rapid\neye movement sleep without polysomnography or history of Parkinson’s disease or other\nsynucleinopathy”).\n422\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nUnspecified Sleep-Wake Disorder\n780.59 (G47.9)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a sleep-wake\ndisorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or\nother important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of\nthe disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class and do not qualify for a diagno-\nsis of unspecified insomnia disorder or unspecified hypersomnolence disorder. The un-\nspecified sleep-wake disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses\nnot to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific sleep-wake disorder,\nand includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more spe-\ncific diagnosis.\n423\nSexual\nDysfunctions\nSexual dysfunctions include delayed ejaculation, erectile disorder, female orgasmic\ndisorder, female sexual interest/arousal disorder, genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder,\nmale hypoactive sexual desire disorder, premature (early) ejaculation, substance/medication-\ninduced sexual dysfunction, other specified sexual dysfunction, and unspecified sexual dys-\nfunction. Sexual dysfunctions are a heterogeneous group of disorders that are typically char-\nacterized by a clinically significant disturbance in a person’s ability to respond sexually or to\nexperience sexual pleasure. An individual may have several sexual dysfunctions at the same\ntime. In such cases, all of the dysfunctions should be diagnosed.\nClinical judgment should be used to determine if the sexual difficulties are the result of\ninadequate sexual stimulation; in these cases, there may still be a need for care, but a di-\nagnosis of a sexual dysfunction would not be made. These cases may include, but are not\nlimited to, conditions in which lack of knowledge about effective stimulation prevents the\nexperience of arousal or orgasm.There is some evidence to suggest that delayed ejaculation may be more common in severe\nforms of major depressive disorder.\nErectile DisorderErectile disorder can be comorbid with other sexual diagnoses, such as premature (early)\nejaculation and male hypoactive sexual desire disorder, as well as with anxiety and de-\npressive disorders. Erectile disorder is common in men with lower urinary tract symptoms\nrelated to prostatic hypertrophy. Erectile disorder may be comorbid with dyslipidemia, car-\ndiovascular disease, hypogonadism, multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and other diseases\nthat interfere with the vascular, neurological, or endocrine function necessary for normal\nerectile function.\nRelationship to International Classification of Diseases\nErectile response is coded as failure of genital response in ICD-10 (F2.2).\nFemale Orgasmic Disordertural/religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity;\nattitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treat-\nment. Each of these factors may contribute differently to the presenting symptoms of dif-\nferent women with this disorder.Women with female orgasmic disorder may have co-occurring sexual interest/arousal\ndifficulties. Women with diagnoses of other nonsexual mental disorders, such as major de-\npressive disorder, may experience lower sexual interest/arousal, and this may indirectly\nincrease the likelihood of orgasmic difficulties.\nFemale Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder\n433\nFemale Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorderextremely common. Sexual distress and dissatisfaction with sex life are also highly cor-\nrelated in women with low sexual desire. Distressing low desire is associated with depres-\nsion, thyroid problems, anxiety, urinary incontinence, and other medical factors. Arthritis\nand inflammatory or irritable bowel disease are also associated with sexual arousal prob-\nGenito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder\n437\nlems. Low desire appears to be comorbid with depression, sexual and physical abuse in\nadulthood, global mental functioning, and use of alcohol.\nGenito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorderties appears to be common. Comorbidity with relationship distress is also common. This is\nnot surprising, since in Western cultures the inability to have (pain-free) intercourse with\na desired partner and the avoidance of sexual opportunities may be either a contributing\nfactor to or the result of other sexual or relationship problems. Because pelvic floor symp-\ntoms are implicated in the diagnosis of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder, there is\nlikely to be a higher prevalence of other disorders related to the pelvic floor or reproduc-\ntive organs (e.g., interstitial cystitis, constipation, vaginal infection, endometriosis, irrita-\nble bowel syndrome).\nMale Hypoactive Sexual Desire DisorderDepression and other mental disorders, as well as endocrinological factors, are often co-\nmorbid with male hypoactive sexual desire disorder.\nPremature (Early) Ejaculationreligious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes\ntoward sexuality); and 5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment.Premature (early) ejaculation may be associated with erectile problems. In many cases, it\nmay be difficult to determine which difficulty preceded the other. Lifelong premature\n(early) ejaculation may be associated with certain anxiety disorders. Acquired premature\n(early) ejaculation may be associated with prostatitis, thyroid disease, or drug withdrawal\n(e.g., during opioid withdrawal).\nSubstance/Medication-Induced\nSexual DysfunctionClinically referred children with gender dysphoria show elevated levels of emotional and\nbehavioral problems—most commonly, anxiety, disruptive and impulse-control, and de-\nOther Specified Gender Dysphoria\n459\npressive disorders. In prepubertal children, increasing age is associated with having more\nbehavioral or emotional problems; this is related to the increasing non-acceptance of gen-\nder-variant behavior by others. In older children, gender-variant behavior often leads to\npeer ostracism, which may lead to more behavioral problems. The prevalence of mental\nhealth problems differs among cultures; these differences may also be related to differences\nin attitudes toward gender variance in children. However, also in some non-Western cul-\ntures, anxiety has been found to be relatively common in individuals with gender dysphoria,\neven in cultures with accepting attitudes toward gender-variant behavior. Autism spec-\ntrum disorder is more prevalent in clinically referred children with gender dysphoria than\nin the general population. Clinically referred adolescents with gender dysphoria appear to\nhave comorbid mental disorders, with anxiety and depressive disorders being the most\ncommon. As in children, autism spectrum disorder is more prevalent in clinically referred\nadolescents with gender dysphoria than in the general population. Clinically referred\nadults with gender dysphoria may have coexisting mental health problems, most commonly\nanxiety and depressive disorders.\nOther Specified Gender Dysphoria\n302.6 (F64.8)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of gender dys-\nphoria that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other\nimportant areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for gender dys-\nphoria. The other specified gender dysphoria category is used in situations in which the\nclinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet\nthe criteria for gender dysphoria. This is done by recording “other specified gender dys-\nphoria” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “brief gender dysphoria”).\nAn example of a presentation that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-\nnation is the following:\nThe current disturbance meets symptom criteria for gender dysphoria, but the\nduration is less than 6 months.\nUnspecified Gender Dysphoria\n302.6 (F64.9)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of gender dys-\nphoria that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or oth-\ner important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for gender\ndysphoria. The unspecified gender dysphoria category is used in situations in which the\nclinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for gender dyspho-\nria, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more\nspecific diagnosis.\nThis page intentionally left blank\n461\nDisruptive, Impulse-Control,\nand Conduct Disorders\nDisruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders include conditions involv-\ning problems in the self-control of emotions and behaviors. While other disorders in DSM-\n5 may also involve problems in emotional and/or behavioral regulation, the disorders in\nthis chapter are unique in that these problems are manifested in behaviors that violate the\nrights of others (e.g., aggression, destruction of property) and/or that bring the individual\ninto significant conflict with societal norms or authority figures. The underlying causes of\nthe problems in the self-control of emotions and behaviors can vary greatly across the dis-\norders in this chapter and among individuals within a given diagnostic category.\nThe chapter includes oppositional defiant disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, con-\nduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder (which is described in the chapter “Personality\nDisorders”), pyromania, kleptomania, and other specified and unspecified disruptive, im-\npulse-control, and conduct disorders. Although all the disorders in the chapter involve\nproblems in both emotional and behavioral regulation, the source of variation among the\ndisorders is the relative emphasis on problems in the two types of self-control. For example,\nthe criteria for conduct disorder focus largely on poorly controlled behaviors that violate the\nrights of others or that violate major societal norms. Many of the behavioral symptoms (e.g.,\naggression) can be a result of poorly controlled emotions such as anger. At the other extreme,\nthe criteria for intermittent explosive disorder focus largely on such poorly controlled emo-\ntion, outbursts of anger that are disproportionate to the interpersonal or other provocation\nor to other psychosocial stressors. Intermediate in impact to these two disorders is opposi-\ntional defiant disorder, in which the criteria are more evenly distributed between emotions\n(anger and irritation) and behaviors (argumentativeness and defiance). Pyromania and\nkleptomania are less commonly used diagnoses characterized by poor impulse control re-\nlated to specific behaviors (fire setting or stealing) that relieve internal tension. Other speci-\nfied disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder is a category for conditions in which\nthere are symptoms of conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or other disruptive,\nimpulse-control, and conduct disorders, but the number of symptoms does not meet the di-\nagnostic threshold for any of the disorders in this chapter, even though there is evidence of\nclinically significant impairment associated with the symptoms.\nThe disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders all tend to be more common in\nmales than in females, although the relative degree of male predominance may differ both\nacross disorders and within a disorder at different ages. The disorders in this chapter tend to\nhave first onset in childhood or adolescence. In fact, it is very rare for either conduct disorder or\noppositional defiant disorder to first emerge in adulthood. There is a developmental relation-\nship between oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, in that most cases of con-\nduct disorder previously would have met criteria for oppositional defiant disorder, at least in\nthose cases in which conduct disorder emerges prior to adolescence. However, most children\nwith oppositional defiant disorder do not eventually develop conduct disorder. Furthermore,\nchildren with oppositional defiant disorder are at risk for eventually developing other prob-\nlems besides conduct disorder, including anxiety and depressive disorders.\nMany of the symptoms that define the disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disor-\nders are behaviors that can occur to some degree in typically developing individuals.\nThus, it is critical that the frequency, persistence, pervasiveness across situations, and im-\n462\nDisruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders\npairment associated with the behaviors indicative of the diagnosis be considered relative\nto what is normative for a person’s age, gender, and culture when determining if they are\nsymptomatic of a disorder.\nThe disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders have been linked to a common\nexternalizing spectrum associated with the personality dimensions labeled as disinhibition\nand (inversely) constraint and, to a lesser extent, negative emotionality. These shared per-\nsonality dimensions could account for the high level of comorbidity among these disorders\nand their frequent comorbidity with substance use disorders and antisocial personality\ndisorder. However, the specific nature of the shared diathesis that constitutes the exter-\nnalizing spectrum remains unknown.\nOppositional Defiant DisorderRates of oppositional defiant disorder are much higher in samples of children, adoles-\ncents, and adults with ADHD, and this may be the result of shared temperamental risk fac-\ntors. Also, oppositional defiant disorder often precedes conduct disorder, although this\nappears to be most common in children with the childhood-onset subtype. Individuals\nwith oppositional defiant disorder are also at increased risk for anxiety disorders and ma-\njor depressive disorder, and this seems largely attributable to the presence of the angry-\nirritable mood symptoms. Adolescents and adults with oppositional defiant disorder also\nshow a higher rate of substance use disorders, although it is unclear if this association is in-\ndependent of the comorbidity with conduct disorder.\nIntermittent Explosive DisorderDepressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders are most commonly\ncomorbid with intermittent explosive disorder. In addition, individuals with antisocial\npersonality disorder or borderline personality disorder, and individuals with a history of\ndisorders with disruptive behaviors (e.g., ADHD, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant\ndisorder), are at greater risk for comorbid intermittent explosive disorder.\nConduct DisorderADHD and oppositional defiant disorder are both common in individuals with conduct\ndisorder, and this comorbid presentation predicts worse outcomes. Individuals who show\nthe personality features associated with antisocial personality disorder often violate the\nbasic rights of others or violate major age-appropriate societal norms, and as a result their\npattern of behavior often meets criteria for conduct disorder. Conduct disorder may also\nco-occur with one or more of the following mental disorders: specific learning disorder,\nanxiety disorders, depressive or bipolar disorders, and substance-related disorders. Aca-\ndemic achievement, particularly in reading and other verbal skills, is often below the level\nexpected on the basis of age and intelligence and may justify the additional diagnosis of\nspecific learning disorder or a communication disorder.\n476\nDisruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders\nAntisocial Personality Disorder\nCriteria and text for antisocial personality disorder can be found in the chapter “Person-\nality Disorders.” Because this disorder is closely connected to the spectrum of “external-\nizing” conduct disorders in this chapter, as well as to the disorders in the adjoining chapter\n“Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders,” it is dual coded here as well as in the chap-\nter “Personality Disorders.”\nPyromaniaThere appears to be a high co-occurrence of substance use disorders, gambling disorder,\ndepressive and bipolar disorders, and other disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct dis-\norders with pyromania.\n478\nDisruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders\nKleptomaniaKleptomania may be associated with compulsive buying as well as with depressive and\nbipolar disorders (especially major depressive disorder), anxiety disorders, eating disor-\nders (particularly bulimia nervosa), personality disorders, substance use disorders (espe-\ncially alcohol use disorder), and other disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders.\nOther Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control,\nand Conduct Disorder\n312.89 (F91.8)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a disruptive,\nimpulse-control, and conduct disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impair-\nment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do\nnot meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the disruptive, impulse-control, and con-\nduct disorders diagnostic class. The other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and con-\nduct disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate\nthe specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific disrup-\ntive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder. This is done by recording “other specified dis-\nruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g.,\n“recurrent behavioral outbursts of insufficient frequency”).\n480\nDisruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders\nUnspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control,\nand Conduct Disorder\n312.9 (F91.9)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a disruptive,\nimpulse-control, and conduct disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impair-\nment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do\nnot meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the disruptive, impulse-control, and con-\nduct disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct\ndisorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the rea-\nson that the criteria are not met for a specific disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct dis-\norder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more\nspecific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).\n481\nSubstance-Related and\nAddictive Disorders\nThe substance-related disorders encompass 10 separate classes of drugs: alco-\nhol; caffeine; cannabis; hallucinogens (with separate categories for phencyclidine [or sim-\nilarly acting arylcyclohexylamines] and other hallucinogens); inhalants; opioids;\nsedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics; stimulants (amphetamine-type substances, cocaine,\nand other stimulants); tobacco; and other (or unknown) substances. These 10 classes are\nnot fully distinct. All drugs that are taken in excess have in common direct activation of\nthe brain reward system, which is involved in the reinforcement of behaviors and the pro-\nduction of memories. They produce such an intense activation of the reward system that\nnormal activities may be neglected. Instead of achieving reward system activation\nthrough adaptive behaviors, drugs of abuse directly activate the reward pathways. The\npharmacological mechanisms by which each class of drugs produces reward are different,\nbut the drugs typically activate the system and produce feelings of pleasure, often re-\nferred to as a “high.” Furthermore, individuals with lower levels of self-control, which\nmay reflect impairments of brain inhibitory mechanisms, may be particularly predisposed\nto develop substance use disorders, suggesting that the roots of substance use disorders\nfor some persons can be seen in behaviors long before the onset of actual substance use\nitself.\nIn addition to the substance-related disorders, this chapter also includes gambling dis-\norder, reflecting evidence that gambling behaviors activate reward systems similar to\nthose activated by drugs of abuse and produce some behavioral symptoms that appear\ncomparable to those produced by the substance use disorders. Other excessive behavioral\npatterns, such as Internet gaming, have also been described, but the research on these and\nother behavioral syndromes is less clear. Thus, groups of repetitive behaviors, which some\nterm behavioral addictions, with such subcategories as “sex addiction,” “exercise addiction,”\nor “shopping addiction,” are not included because at this time there is insufficient peer-re-\nviewed evidence to establish the diagnostic criteria and course descriptions needed to\nidentify these behaviors as mental disorders.\nThe substance-related disorders are divided into two groups: substance use disorders\nand substance-induced disorders. The following conditions may be classified as sub-\nstance-induced: intoxication, withdrawal, and other substance/medication-induced men-\ntal disorders (psychotic disorders, bipolar and related disorders, depressive disorders,\nanxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, sleep disorders, sexual dys-\nfunctions, delirium, and neurocognitive disorders).\nThe current section begins with a general discussion of criteria sets for a substance\nuse disorder, substance intoxication and withdrawal, and other substance/medication-\ninduced mental disorders, at least some of which are applicable across classes of sub-\nstances. Reflecting some unique aspects of the 10 substance classes relevant to this chapter,\nthe remainder of the chapter is organized by the class of substance and describes their\nunique aspects. To facilitate differential diagnosis, the text and criteria for the remaining\nsubstance/medication-induced mental disorders are included with disorders with which\nthey share phenomenology (e.g., substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is in\nthe chapter “Depressive Disorders”). The broad diagnostic categories associated with each\nspecific group of substances are shown in Table 1.\n482\nSubstance-Related and Addictive Disorders\nTABLE 1 Diagnoses associated with substance class\n\nPsychotic\ndisorders\nBipolar\ndisorders\nDepres-\nsive\ndisorders\nAnxiety\ndisorders\nObsessive-\ncompulsive\nand related\ndisorders\nSleep\ndisorders\nSexual\ndysfunc-\ntions\nDelirium\nNeuro-\ncognitive\ndisorders\nSubstance\nuse\ndisorders\nSub-\nstance\nintoxi-\ncation\nSub-\nstance\nwith-\ndrawal\nAlcohol\nI/W\nI/W\nI/W\nI/W\nI/W\nI/W\nI/W\nI/W/P\nX\nX\nX\nCaffeine\n\n\nI\n\nI/W\n\n\n\nX\nX\nCannabis\nI\n\nI\n\nI/W\n\nI\nX\nX\nX\nHallucinogens\nPhencyclidine\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\n\nI\nX\nX\n\nOther hallucino-\ngens\nI*\nI\nI\nI\n\n\nI\nX\nX\n\nInhalants\nI\nI\nI\n\n\n\nI\nI/P\nX\nX\n\nOpioids\nI/W\nW\n\nI/W\nI/W\nI/W\nX\nX\nX\nSedatives,\nhypnotics, or\nanxiolytics\nI/W\nI/W\nI/W\nW\nI/W\nI/W\nI/W\nI/W/P\nX\nX\nX\nStimulants**\nI\nI/W\nI/W\nI/W\nI/W\nI/W\nI\nI\nX\nX\nX\nTobacco\n\n\n\n\nW\n\n\nX\n\nX\nOther (or\nunknown)\nI/W\nI/W\nI/W\nI/W\nI/W\nI/W\nI/W\nI/W\nI/W/P\nX\nX\nX\nNote.

As seen in Table 1, the diagnosis of a sub-\nstance use disorder can be applied to all 10 classes included in this chapter except caffeine.\nFor certain classes some symptoms are less salient, and in a few instances not all symptoms\napply (e.g., withdrawal symptoms are not specified for phencyclidine use disorder, other\nhallucinogen use disorder, or inhalant use disorder).\nAn important characteristic of substance use disorders is an underlying change in brain cir-\ncuits that may persist beyond detoxification, particularly in individuals with severe disorders.\nThe behavioral effects of these brain changes may be exhibited in the repeated relapses and in-\ntense drug craving when the individuals are exposed to drug-related stimuli. These persistent\ndrug effects may benefit from long-term approaches to treatment.\nOverall, the diagnosis of a substance use disorder is based on a pathological pattern of\nbehaviors related to use of the substance. To assist with organization, Criterion A criteria can\nbe considered to fit within overall groupings of impaired control, social impairment, risky use,\nand pharmacological criteria. Impaired control over substance use is the first criteria grouping\n(Criteria 1–4). The individual may take the substance in larger amounts or over a longer pe-\nriod than was originally intended (Criterion 1). The individual may express a persistent de-\nsire to cut down or regulate substance use and may report multiple unsuccessful efforts to\ndecrease or discontinue use (Criterion 2). The individual may spend a great deal of time ob-\ntaining the substance, using the substance, or recovering from its effects (Criterion 3). In\nsome instances of more severe substance use disorders, virtually all of the individual’s daily\nactivities revolve around the substance. Craving (Criterion 4) is manifested by an intense de-\nsire or urge for the drug that may occur at any time but is more likely when in an environ-\nment where the drug previously was obtained or used. Craving has also been shown to\ninvolve classical conditioning and is associated with activation of specific reward structures\nin the brain. Craving is queried by asking if there has ever been a time when they had such\nstrong urges to take the drug that they could not think of anything else. Current craving is of-\nten used as a treatment outcome measure because it may be a signal of impending relapse.\nSocial impairment is the second grouping of criteria (Criteria 5–7). Recurrent substance\nuse may result in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home (Crite-\nrion 5). The individual may continue substance use despite having persistent or recurrent\nsocial or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the substance (Cri-\nterion 6). Important social, occupational, or recreational activities may be given up or re-\nduced because of substance use (Criterion 7). The individual may withdraw from family\nactivities and hobbies in order to use the substance.\nRisky use of the substance is the third grouping of criteria (Criteria 8–9). This may take\nthe form of recurrent substance use in situations in which it is physically hazardous (Cri-\nterion 8). The individual may continue substance use despite knowledge of having a per-\nsistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or\nexacerbated by the substance (Criterion 9). The key issue in evaluating this criterion is not\nthe existence of the problem, but rather the individual’s failure to abstain from using the\nsubstance despite the difficulty it is causing.\n484\nSubstance-Related and Addictive Disorders\nPharmacological criteria are the final grouping (Criteria 10 and 11). Tolerance (Crite-\nrion 10) is signaled by requiring a markedly increased dose of the substance to achieve the\ndesired effect or a markedly reduced effect when the usual dose is consumed. The degree\nto which tolerance develops varies greatly across different individuals as well as across\nsubstances and may involve a variety of central nervous system effects. For example, tol-\nerance to respiratory depression and tolerance to sedating and motor coordination may\ndevelop at different rates, depending on the substance. Tolerance may be difficult to de-\ntermine by history alone, and laboratory tests may be helpful (e.g., high blood levels of the\nsubstance coupled with little evidence of intoxication suggest that tolerance is likely). Tol-\nerance must also be distinguished from individual variability in the initial sensitivity to\nthe effects of particular substances. For example, some first-time alcohol drinkers show\nvery little evidence of intoxication with three or four drinks, whereas others of similar\nweight and drinking histories have slurred speech and incoordination.\nWithdrawal (Criterion 11) is a syndrome that occurs when blood or tissue concentra-\ntions of a substance decline in an individual who had maintained prolonged heavy use of\nthe substance. After developing withdrawal symptoms, the individual is likely to con-\nsume the substance to relieve the symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms vary greatly across\nthe classes of substances, and separate criteria sets for withdrawal are provided for the\ndrug classes. Marked and generally easily measured physiological signs of withdrawal are\ncommon with alcohol, opioids, and sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics. Withdrawal\nsigns and symptoms with stimulants (amphetamines and cocaine), as well as tobacco and\ncannabis, are often present but may be less apparent. Significant withdrawal has not been\ndocumented in humans after repeated use of phencyclidine, other hallucinogens, and in-\nhalants; therefore, this criterion is not included for these substances. Neither tolerance nor\nwithdrawal is necessary for a diagnosis of a substance use disorder. However, for most\nclasses of substances, a past history of withdrawal is associated with a more severe clinical\ncourse (i.e., an earlier onset of a substance use disorder, higher levels of substance intake,\nand a greater number of substance-related problems).\nSymptoms of tolerance and withdrawal occurring during appropriate medical treat-\nment with prescribed medications (e.g., opioid analgesics, sedatives, stimulants) are spe-\ncifically not counted when diagnosing a substance use disorder. The appearance of normal,\nexpected pharmacological tolerance and withdrawal during the course of medical treat-\nment has been known to lead to an erroneous diagnosis of “addiction” even when these\nwere the only symptoms present. Individuals whose only symptoms are those that occur\nas a result of medical treatment (i.e., tolerance and withdrawal as part of medical care\nwhen the medications are taken as prescribed) should not receive a diagnosis solely on the\nbasis of these symptoms. However, prescription medications can be used inappropriately,\nand a substance use disorder can be correctly diagnosed when there are other symptoms\nof compulsive, drug-seeking behavior.\nSeverity and Specifiers\nSubstance use disorders occur in a broad range of severity, from mild to severe, with se-\nverity based on the number of symptom criteria endorsed. As a general estimate of sever-\nity, a mild substance use disorder is suggested by the presence of two to three symptoms,\nmoderate by four to five symptoms, and severe by six or more symptoms. Changing severity\nacross time is also reflected by reductions or increases in the frequency and/or dose of\nsubstance use, as assessed by the individual’s own report, report of knowledgeable others,\nclinician’s observations, and biological testing. The following course specifiers and descrip-\ntive features specifiers are also available for substance use disorders: “in early remission,”\n“in sustained remission,” “on maintenance therapy,” and “in a controlled environment.”\nDefinitions of each are provided within respective criteria sets.\nSubstance Use Disorders\n485"}, "provenance": {"source_file": "substance_related_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 1, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.593325"}}

Alcohol withdrawal is characterized by\nwithdrawal symptoms that develop approximately 4–12 hours after the reduction of in-\ntake following prolonged, heavy alcohol ingestion. Because withdrawal from alcohol can\nbe unpleasant and intense, individuals may continue to consume alcohol despite adverse\nconsequences, often to avoid or to relieve withdrawal symptoms. Some withdrawal symp-\ntoms (e.g., sleep problems) can persist at lower intensities for months and can contribute to\nrelapse. Once a pattern of repetitive and intense use develops, individuals with alcohol\nuse disorder may devote substantial periods of time to obtaining and consuming alcoholic\nbeverages.\nCraving for alcohol is indicated by a strong desire to drink that makes it difficult to\nthink of anything else and that often results in the onset of drinking. School and job per-\nformance may also suffer either from the aftereffects of drinking or from actual intoxica-\ntion at school or on the job; child care or household responsibilities may be neglected; and\nalcohol-related absences may occur from school or work. The individual may use alcohol\nin physically hazardous circumstances (e.g., driving an automobile, swimming, operating\nmachinery while intoxicated). Finally, individuals with an alcohol use disorder may con-\ntinue to consume alcohol despite the knowledge that continued consumption poses sig-\nnificant physical (e.g., blackouts, liver disease), psychological (e.g., depression), social, or\ninterpersonal problems (e.g., violent arguments with spouse while intoxicated, child\nabuse).", "associated_features": "Alcohol use disorder is often associated with problems similar to those associated with\nother substances (e.g., cannabis; cocaine; heroin; amphetamines; sedatives, hypnotics, or\nanxiolytics). Alcohol may be used to alleviate the unwanted effects of these other\nsubstances or to substitute for them when they are not available. Symptoms of conduct\nproblems, depression, anxiety, and insomnia frequently accompany heavy drinking and\nsometimes precede it.\nRepeated intake of high doses of alcohol can affect nearly every organ system, espe-\ncially the gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, and the central and peripheral ner-\nvous systems. Gastrointestinal effects include gastritis, stomach or duodenal ulcers, and,\nin about 15% of individuals who use alcohol heavily, liver cirrhosis and/or pancreatitis.\nThere is also an increased rate of cancer of the esophagus, stomach, and other parts of the\ngastrointestinal tract. One of the most commonly associated conditions is low-grade hy-\npertension. Cardiomyopathy and other myopathies are less common but occur at an in-\nAlcohol Use Disorder\n493\ncreased rate among those who drink very heavily. These factors, along with marked\nincreases in levels of triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, contribute to\nan elevated risk of heart disease. Peripheral neuropathy may be evidenced by muscular\nweakness, paresthesias, and decreased peripheral sensation. More persistent central ner-\nvous system effects include cognitive deficits, severe memory impairment, and degener-\native changes in the cerebellum. These effects are related to the direct effects of alcohol or\nof trauma and to vitamin deficiencies (particularly of the B vitamins, including thiamine).\nOne devastating central nervous system effect is the relatively rare alcohol-induced per-\nsisting amnestic disorder, or Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, in which the ability to encode\nnew memory is severely impaired. This condition would now be described within the chap-\nter “Neurocognitive Disorders” and would be termed a substance/medication-induced neuro-\ncognitive disorder.\nAlcohol use disorder is an important contributor to suicide risk during severe intoxi-\ncation and in the context of a temporary alcohol-induced depressive and bipolar disorder.\nThere is an increased rate of suicidal behavior as well as of completed suicide among in-\ndividuals with the disorder.", "prevalence": "Alcohol use disorder is a common disorder. In the United States, the 12-month prevalence\nof alcohol use disorder is estimated to be 4.6% among 12- to 17-year-olds and 8.5% among\nadults age 18 years and older in the United States. Rates of the disorder are greater among\nadult men (12.4%) than among adult women (4.9%). Twelve-month prevalence of alcohol\nuse disorder among adults decreases in middle age, being greatest among individuals 18-\nto 29-years-old (16.2%) and lowest among individuals age 65 years and older (1.5%).\nTwelve-month prevalence varies markedly across race/ethnic subgroups of the U.S.\npopulation. For 12- to 17-year-olds, rates are greatest among Hispanics (6.0%) and Native\nAmericans and Alaska Natives (5.7%) relative to whites (5.0%), African Americans (1.8%),\nand Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (1.6%). In contrast, among adults, the 12-monthNatives (12.1%) than among whites (8.9%), Hispanics (7.9%), African Americans (6.9%),\nand Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (4.5%).", "development_course": "The first episode of alcohol intoxication is likely to occur during the mid-teens. Alcohol-\nrelated problems that do not meet full criteria for a use disorder or isolated problems may\noccur prior to age 20 years, but the age at onset of an alcohol use disorder with two or more\nof the criteria clustered together peaks in the late teens or early to mid 20s. The large ma-\njority of individuals who develop alcohol-related disorders do so by their late 30s. The first\nevidence of withdrawal is not likely to appear until after many other aspects of an alcohol\nuse disorder have developed. An earlier onset of alcohol use disorder is observed in ado-\nlescents with preexisting conduct problems and those with an earlier onset of intoxication.\nAlcohol use disorder has a variable course that is characterized by periods of remission\nand relapse. A decision to stop drinking, often in response to a crisis, is likely to be followed\nby a period of weeks or more of abstinence, which is often followed by limited periods of\ncontrolled or nonproblematic drinking. However, once alcohol intake resumes, it is highly\nlikely that consumption will rapidly escalate and that severe problems will once again\ndevelop.\nAlcohol use disorder is often erroneously perceived as an intractable condition, per-\nhaps based on the fact that individuals who present for treatment typically have a history\nof many years of severe alcohol-related problems. However, these most severe cases rep-\nresent only a small proportion of individuals with this disorder, and the typical individual\nwith the disorder has a much more promising prognosis.\n494\nSubstance-Related and Addictive Disorders\nAmong adolescents, conduct disorder and repeated antisocial behavior often co-occur\nwith alcohol- and with other substance-related disorders. While most individuals with al-\ncohol use disorder develop the condition before age 40 years, perhaps 10% have later\nonset. Age-related physical changes in older individuals result in increased brain suscep-\ntibility to the depressant effects of alcohol; decreased rates of liver metabolism of a variety\nof substances, including alcohol; and decreased percentages of body water. These changes\ncan cause older people to develop more severe intoxication and subsequent problems at\nlower levels of consumption. Alcohol-related problems in older people are also especially\nlikely to be associated with other medical complications.", "risk_factors": "Environmental.\nEnvironmental risk and prognostic factors may include cultural atti-\ntudes toward drinking and intoxication, the availability of alcohol (including price),\nacquired personal experiences with alcohol, and stress levels. Additional potential medi-\nators of how alcohol problems develop in predisposed individuals include heavier peer\nsubstance use, exaggerated positive expectations of the effects of alcohol, and suboptimal\nways of coping with stress.\nGenetic and physiological.\nAlcohol use disorder runs in families, with 40%–60% of the\nvariance of risk explained by genetic influences. The rate of this condition is three to four\ntimes higher in close relatives of individuals with alcohol use disorder, with values highest\nfor individuals with a greater number of affected relatives, closer genetic relationships to\nthe affected person, and higher severity of the alcohol-related problems in those relatives.\nA significantly higher rate of alcohol use disorders exists in the monozygotic twin than in\nthe dizygotic twin of an individual with the condition. A three- to fourfold increase in risk\nhas been observed in children of individuals with alcohol use disorder, even when these\nchildren were given up for adoption at birth and raised by adoptive parents who did not\nhave the disorder.\nRecent advances in our understanding of genes that operate through intermediate\ncharacteristics (or phenotypes) to affect the risk of alcohol use disorder can help to identify\nindividuals who might be at particularly low or high risk for alcohol use disorder. Among\nthe low-risk phenotypes are the acute alcohol-related skin flush (seen most prominently in\nAsians). High vulnerability is associated with preexisting schizophrenia or bipolar disor-\nder, as well as impulsivity (producing enhanced rates of all substance use disorders and\ngambling disorder), and a high risk specifically for alcohol use disorder is associated with\na low level of response (low sensitivity) to alcohol. A number of gene variations may ac-\ncount for low response to alcohol or modulate the dopamine reward systems; it is impor-\ntant to note, however, that any one gene variation is likely to explain only 1%–2% of the risk\nfor these disorders.\nCourse modifiers.\nIn general, high levels of impulsivity are associated with an earlier\nonset and more severe alcohol use disorder.", "cultural_issues": "In most cultures, alcohol is the most frequently used intoxicating substance and contrib-\nutes to considerable morbidity and mortality. An estimated 3.8% of all global deaths and\n4.6% of global disability-adjusted life-years are attributable to alcohol. In the United States,\n80% of adults (age 18 years and older) have consumed alcohol at some time in their lives,\nand 65% are current drinkers (last 12 months). An estimated 3.6% of the world population\n(15–64 years old) has a current (12-month) alcohol use disorder, with a lower prevalence\n(1.1%) found in the African region, a higher rate (5.2%) found in the American region (North,\nSouth, and Central America and the Caribbean), and the highest rate (10.9%) found in the\nEastern Europe region.\nAlcohol Use Disorder\n495\nPolymorphisms of genes for the alcohol-metabolizing enzymes alcohol dehydroge-\nnase and aldehyde dehydrogenase are most often seen in Asians and affect the response to\nalcohol. When consuming alcohol, individuals with these gene variations can experience a\nflushed face and palpitations, reactions that can be so severe as to limit or preclude future\nalcohol consumption and diminish the risk for alcohol use disorder. These gene variations\nare seen in as many as 40% of Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and related groups worldwide\nand are related to lower risks for the disorder.\nDespite small variations regarding individual criterion items, the diagnostic criteria\nperform equally well across most race/ethnicity groups.", "gender_issues": "Males have higher rates of drinking and related disorders than females. However, because\nfemales generally weigh less than males, have more fat and less water in their bodies, and\nmetabolize less alcohol in their esophagus and stomach, they are likely to develop higher\nblood alcohol levels per drink than males. Females who drink heavily may also be more\nvulnerable than males to some of the physical consequences associated with alcohol, in-\ncluding liver disease.", "diagnostic_markers": "Individuals whose heavier drinking places them at elevated risk for alcohol use disorder\ncan be identified both through standardized questionnaires and by elevations in blood test\nresults likely to be seen with regular heavier drinking. These measures do not establish a\ndiagnosis of an alcohol-related disorder but can be useful in highlighting individuals for\nwhom more information should be gathered. The most direct test available to measure al-\ncohol consumption cross-sectionally is blood alcohol concentration, which can also be used to\njudge tolerance to alcohol. For example, an individual with a concentration of 150 mg of\nethanol per deciliter (dL) of blood who does not show signs of intoxication can be pre-\nsumed to have acquired at least some degree of tolerance to alcohol. At 200 mg/dL, most\nnontolerant individuals demonstrate severe intoxication.\nRegarding laboratory tests, one sensitive laboratory indicator of heavy drinking is a\nmodest elevation or high-normal levels (>35 units) of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT).\nThis may be the only laboratory finding. At least 70% of individuals with a high GGT level\nare persistent heavy drinkers (i.e., consuming eight or more drinks daily on a regular basis).\nA second test with comparable or even higher levels of sensitivity and specificity is carbo-\nhydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT), with levels of 20 units or higher useful in identifying in-\ndividuals who regularly consume eight or more drinks daily. Since both GGT and CDT\nlevels return toward normal within days to weeks of stopping drinking, both state markers\nmay be useful in monitoring abstinence, especially when the clinician observes increases,\nrather than decreases, in these values over time—a finding indicating that the person is\nlikely to have returned to heavy drinking. The combination of tests for CDT and GGT may\nhave even higher levels of sensitivity and specificity than either test used alone. Additional\nuseful tests include the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which may be elevated to high-\nnormal values in individuals who drink heavily—a change that is due to the direct toxic ef-\nfects of alcohol on erythropoiesis. Although the MCV can be used to help identify those who\ndrink heavily, it is a poor method of monitoring abstinence because of the long half-life of\nred blood cells. Liver function tests (e.g., alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and alkaline phos-\nphatase) can reveal liver injury that is a consequence of heavy drinking. Other potential\nmarkers of heavy drinking that are more nonspecific for alcohol but can help the clinician\nthink of the possible effects of alcohol include elevations in blood levels or lipids (e.g., tri-\nglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and high-normal levels of uric acid.\nAdditional diagnostic markers relate to signs and symptoms that reflect the consequences\noften associated with persistent heavy drinking. For example, dyspepsia, nausea, and bloat-\n496\nSubstance-Related and Addictive Disorders\ning can accompany gastritis, and hepatomegaly, esophageal varices, and hemorrhoids may\nreflect alcohol-induced changes in the liver. Other physical signs of heavy drinking include\ntremor, unsteady gait, insomnia, and erectile dysfunction. Males with chronic alcohol use dis-\norder may exhibit decreased testicular size and feminizing effects associated with reduced\ntestosterone levels. Repeated heavy drinking in females is associated with menstrual irregu-\nlarities and, during pregnancy, spontaneous abortion and fetal alcohol syndrome. Individu-\nals with preexisting histories of epilepsy or severe head trauma are more likely to develop\nalcohol-related seizures.

These include driving and operating machinery, school and work,\ninterpersonal relationships and communication, and health.

Higher blood alcohol levels (e.g., in\nexcess of 300–400 mg/dL) can cause inhibition of respiration and pulse and even death in\nnontolerant individuals. The duration of intoxication depends on how much alcohol was\nconsumed over what period of time.

In these cases, the naloxone chal-\nlenge will not reverse all of the sedative effects.\nOther opioid-related disorders.\nOpioid intoxication is distinguished from the other\nopioid-induced disorders (e.g., opioid-induced depressive disorder, with onset during in-\ntoxication) because the symptoms in the latter disorders predominate in the clinical pre-\nsentation and meet full criteria for the relevant disorder.", "comorbidity": ""}, "provenance": {"source_file": "substance_related_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 24, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.597325"}}

The withdrawal syndrome can also be precipitated\nby administration of an opioid antagonist (e.g., naloxone or naltrexone) after a period of\nopioid use (Criterion A2). This may also occur after administration of an opioid partial ag-\nonist such as buprenorphine to a person currently using a full opioid agonist.\nOpioid withdrawal is characterized by a pattern of signs and symptoms that are oppo-\nsite to the acute agonist effects. The first of these are subjective and consist of complaints of\nanxiety, restlessness, and an “achy feeling” that is often located in the back and legs, along\nwith irritability and increased sensitivity to pain. Three or more of the following must be\npresent to make a diagnosis of opioid withdrawal: dysphoric mood; nausea or vomiting;\nmuscle aches; lacrimation or rhinorrhea; pupillary dilation, piloerection, or increased\nsweating; diarrhea; yawning; fever; and insomnia (Criterion B). Piloerection and fever are\nassociated with more severe withdrawal and are not often seen in routine clinical practice\nbecause individuals with opioid use disorder usually obtain substances before with-\ndrawal becomes that far advanced. These symptoms of opioid withdrawal must cause\nclinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important ar-\neas of functioning (Criterion C). The symptoms must not be attributable to another med-\nical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion D).\nMeeting diagnostic criteria for opioid withdrawal alone is not sufficient for a diagnosis of\nopioid use disorder, but concurrent symptoms of craving and drug-seeking behavior are\nsuggestive of comorbid opioid use disorder. ICD-10-CM codes only allow a diagnosis of\nopioid withdrawal in the presence of comorbid moderate to severe opioid use disorder.\nThe speed and severity of withdrawal associated with opioids depend on the half-life of\nthe opioid used. Most individuals who are physiologically dependent on short-acting drugs\nsuch as heroin begin to have withdrawal symptoms within 6–12 hours after the last dose.\nSymptoms may take 2–4 days to emerge in the case of longer-acting drugs such as metha-\ndone, LAAM (L-alpha-acetylmethadol), or buprenorphine. Acute withdrawal symptoms for\na short-acting opioid such as heroin usually peak within 1–3 days and gradually subside\nover a period of 5–7 days. Less acute withdrawal symptoms can last for weeks to months.\nThese more chronic symptoms include anxiety, dysphoria, anhedonia, and insomnia.\nOpioid Withdrawal\n549", "associated_features": "Males with opioid withdrawal may experience piloerection, sweating, and spontaneous\nejaculations while awake.

This class of substances includes all prescription sleeping medications and\nalmost all prescription antianxiety medications. Nonbenzodiazepine antianxiety agents\n(e.g., buspirone, gepirone) are not included in this class because they do not appear to be\nassociated with significant misuse.\nLike alcohol, these agents are brain depressants and can produce similar substance/\nmedication-induced and substance use disorders. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic sub-\nstances are available both by prescription and illegally. Some individuals who obtain these\nsubstances by prescription will develop a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder,\nwhile others who misuse these substances or use them for intoxication will not develop a\nuse disorder. In particular, sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics with rapid onset and/or\nshort to intermediate lengths of action may be taken for intoxication purposes, although\nlonger acting substances in this class may be taken for intoxication as well.\nCraving (Criterion A4), either while using or during a period of abstinence, is a typical\nfeature of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. Misuse of substances from this\nclass may occur on its own or in conjunction with use of other substances. For example, in-\ndividuals may use intoxicating doses of sedatives or benzodiazepines to “come down”\nfrom cocaine or amphetamines or use high doses of benzodiazepines in combination with\nmethadone to “boost” its effects.\nRepeated absences or poor work performance, school absences, suspensions or expul-\nsions, and neglect of children or household (Criterion A5) may be related to sedative, hyp-\nnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, as may the continued use of the substances despite\narguments with a spouse about consequences of intoxication or despite physical fights\n(Criterion A6). Limiting contact with family or friends, avoiding work or school, or stop-\nping participation in hobbies, sports, or games (Criterion A7) and recurrent sedative,\nhypnotic, or anxiolytic use when driving an automobile or operating a machine when im-\npaired by sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use (Criterion A8) are also seen in sedative,\nhypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder.\nVery significant levels of tolerance and withdrawal can develop to the sedative, hyp-\nnotic, or anxiolytic.

Sedatives are often used to al-\nleviate the unwanted effects of these other substances. With repeated use of the substance,\ntolerance develops to the sedative effects, and a progressively higher dose is used. However,\ntolerance to brain stem depressant effects develops much more slowly, and as the individual\ntakes more substance to achieve euphoria or other desired effects, there may be a sudden onset\nof respiratory depression and hypotension, which may result in death. Intense or repeated\nsedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication may be associated with severe depression that,\nalthough temporary, can lead to suicide attempt and completed suicide.", "prevalence": "The 12-month prevalences of DSM-IV sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder are es-\ntimated to be 0.3% among 12- to 17-year-olds and 0.2% among adults age 18 years and\nolder.

This\npattern may be especially likely among individuals who have other substance use disor-\nders (e.g., alcohol, opioids, stimulants). An initial pattern of intermittent use socially (e.g.,\nat parties) can lead to daily use and high levels of tolerance. Once this occurs, an increasing\nlevel of interpersonal difficulties, as well as increasingly severe episodes of cognitive dys-\nfunction and physiological withdrawal, can be expected.\nThe second and less frequently observed clinical course begins with an individual who\noriginally obtained the medication by prescription from a physician, usually for the treat-\nment of anxiety, insomnia, or somatic complaints. As either tolerance or a need for higher\ndoses of the medication develops, there is a gradual increase in the dose and frequency of\nself-administration. The individual is likely to continue to justify use on the basis of his or\nher original symptoms of anxiety or insomnia, but substance-seeking behavior becomes\n554\nSubstance-Related and Addictive Disorders\nmore prominent, and the individual may seek out multiple physicians to obtain sufficient\nsupplies of the medication. Tolerance can reach high levels, and withdrawal (including\nseizures and withdrawal delirium) may occur.\nAs with many substance use disorders, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder gen-\nerally has an onset during adolescence or early adult life. There is an increased risk for misuse\nand problems from many psychoactive substances as individuals age. In particular, cognitive\nimpairment increases as a side effect with age, and the metabolism of sedatives, hypnotics, or\nanxiolytics decreases with age among older individuals. Both acute and chronic toxic effects\nof these substances, especially effects on cognition, memory, and motor coordination, are\nlikely to increase with age as a consequence of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic age-\nrelated changes. Individuals with major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) are more likely\nto develop intoxication and impaired physiological functioning at lower doses.\nDeliberate intoxication to achieve a “high” is most likely to be observed in teenagers\nand individuals in their 20s. Problems associated with sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics\nare also seen in individuals in their 40s and older who escalate the dose of prescribed med-\nications. In older individuals, intoxication can resemble a progressive dementia.", "risk_factors": "Temperamental.\nImpulsivity and novelty seeking are individual temperaments that re-\nlate to the propensity to develop a substance use disorder but may themselves be geneti-\ncally determined.\nEnvironmental.\nSince sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics are all pharmaceuticals, a key\nrisk factor relates to availability of the substances. In the United States, the historical pat-\nterns of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic misuse relate to the broad prescribing patterns.\nFor instance, a marked decrease in prescription of barbiturates was associated with an in-\ncrease in benzodiazepine prescribing. Peer factors may relate to genetic predisposition in\nterms of how individuals select their environment. Other individuals at heightened risk\nmight include those with alcohol use disorder who may receive repeated prescriptions in\nresponse to their complaints of alcohol-related anxiety or insomnia.\nGenetic and physiological.\nAs for other substance use disorders, the risk for sedative,\nhypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder can be related to individual, family, peer, social, and\nenvironmental factors.

For example, withdrawal\nfrom shorter-acting substances that are rapidly absorbed and that have no active metabo-\nlites (e.g., triazolam) can begin within hours after the substance is stopped; withdrawal\nfrom substances with long-acting metabolites (e.g., diazepam) may not begin for 1–2 days\nor longer. The withdrawal syndrome produced by substances in this class may be charac-\nterized by the development of a delirium that can be life-threatening. There may be evi-\ndence of tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of a diagnosis of a substance use\ndisorder in an individual who has abruptly discontinued benzodiazepines that were taken\nfor long periods of time at prescribed and therapeutic doses. However, ICD-10-CM codes\nonly allow a diagnosis of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal in the presence of\ncomorbid moderate to severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder.\nThe time course of the withdrawal syndrome is generally predicted by the half-life of\nthe substance. Medications whose actions typically last about 10 hours or less (e.g., loraz-\nepam, oxazepam, temazepam) produce withdrawal symptoms within 6–8 hours of de-\ncreasing blood levels that peak in intensity on the second day and improve markedly by\nthe fourth or fifth day. For substances with longer half-lives (e.g., diazepam), symptoms\nmay not develop for more than 1 week, peak in intensity during the second week, and de-\ncrease markedly during the third or fourth week. There may be additional longer-term\nsymptoms at a much lower level of intensity that persist for several months.\nThe longer the substance has been taken and the higher the dosages used, the more likely\nit is that there will be severe withdrawal. However, withdrawal has been reported with as little\nas 15 mg of diazepam (or its equivalent in other benzodiazepines) when taken daily for several\nmonths. Doses of approximately 40 mg of diazepam (or its equivalent) daily are more likely to\nproduce clinically relevant withdrawal symptoms, and even higher doses (e.g., 100 mg of di-\nazepam) are more likely to be followed by withdrawal seizures or delirium.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of stimulant withdrawal is the presence of a characteristic with- drawal syndrome that develops within a few hours to several days after the cessation of (or marked reduction in) stimulant use (generally high dose) that has been prolonged (Cri- terion A). The withdrawal syndrome is characterized by the development of dysphoric mood accompanied by two or more of the following physiological changes: fatigue, vivid and unpleasant dreams, insomnia or hypersomnia, increased appetite, and psychomotor retardation or agitation (Criterion B). Bradycardia is often present and is a reliable mea- sure of stimulant withdrawal. Anhedonia and drug craving can often be present but are not part of the diagnostic cri- teria. These symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu- pational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C). The symptoms must not be attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion D). 570 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Acute withdrawal symptoms (“a crash”) are often seen after periods of repetitive high-dose use (“runs” or “binges”). These periods are characterized by intense and unpleasant feelings of lassitude and depression and increased appetite, generally requiring several days of rest and recuperation. Depressive symptoms with suicidal ideation or behavior can occur and are gen- erally the most serious problems seen during “crashing” or other forms of stimulant with- drawal. The majority of individuals with stimulant use disorder experience a withdrawal syndrome at some point, and virtually all individuals with the disorder report tolerance. Differential Diagnosis Stimulant use disorder and other stimulant-induced disorders. Stimulant withdrawal is distinguished from stimulant use disorder and from the other stimulant-induced disor- ders (e.g., stimulant-induced intoxication delirium, depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder, anxiety disorder, sexual dysfunction, sleep disorder) because the symptoms of withdrawal predominate the clinical presentation and are severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention. Other Stimulant-Induced Disorders The following stimulant-induced disorders (which include amphetamine-, cocaine-, and other stimulant–induced disorders) are described in other chapters of the manual with dis- orders with which they share phenomenology (see the substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters): stimulant-induced psychotic disorder (“Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders”); stimulant-induced bipolar disorder (“Bipolar and Related Disorders”); stimulant-induced depressive disorder (“Depressive Disorders”); stimulant-induced anxiety disorder (“Anxiety Disorders”); stimulant-induced obsessive- compulsive disorder (“Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders”); stimulant-induced sleep disorder (“Sleep-Wake Disorders”); and stimulant-induced sexual dysfunction (“Sex- ual Dysfunctions”).

Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the comorbid presence of\na moderate or severe amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant use disorder, reflecting\nthe fact that amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant withdrawal can only occur in the\npresence of a moderate or severe amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant use disorder.\nIt is not permissible to code a comorbid mild amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant use\ndisorder with amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant withdrawal.", "subtypes": "", "specifiers": "“In a controlled environment” applies as a further specifier of remission if the individual is\nboth in remission and in a controlled environment (i.e., in early remission in a controlled\nenvironment or in sustained remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these\nenvironments are closely supervised and substance-free jails, therapeutic communities,\nand locked hospital units.", "recording_procedures": "", "diagnostic_features": "The amphetamine and amphetamine-type stimulants include substances with a substi-\ntuted-phenylethylamine structure, such as amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, and meth-\namphetamine. Also included are those substances that are structurally different but have\nsimilar effects, such as methylphenidate. These substances are usually taken orally or in-\ntravenously, although methamphetamine is also taken by the nasal route. In addition to\nthe synthetic amphetamine-type compounds, there are naturally occurring, plant-derived\nstimulants such as khât. Amphetamines and other stimulants may be obtained by prescrip-\ntion for the treatment of obesity, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and narcolepsy.\nConsequently, prescribed stimulants may be diverted into the illegal market. The effects of\namphetamines and amphetamine-like drugs are similar to those of cocaine, such that the\ncriteria for stimulant use disorder are presented here as a single disorder with the ability to\nspecify the particular stimulant used by the individual. Cocaine may be consumed in sev-\neral preparations (e.g., coca leaves, coca paste, cocaine hydrochloride, and cocaine alka-\nloids such as freebase and crack) that differ in potency because of varying levels of purity\nand speed of onset. However, in all forms of the substance, cocaine is the active ingredient.\nCocaine hydrochloride powder is usually “snorted” through the nostrils or dissolved in\nwater and injected intravenously.\nIndividuals exposed to amphetamine-type stimulants or cocaine can develop stimu-\nlant use disorder as rapidly as 1 week, although the onset is not always this rapid. Re-\ngardless of the route of administration, tolerance occurs with repeated use. Withdrawal\nsymptoms, particularly hypersomnia, increased appetite, and dysphoria, can occur and\ncan enhance craving. Most individuals with stimulant use disorder have experienced tol-\nerance or withdrawal.\nUse patterns and course are similar for disorders involving amphetamine-type stimu-\nlants and cocaine, as both substances are potent central nervous system stimulants with\nsimilar psychoactive and sympathomimetic effects. Amphetamine-type stimulants are\nlonger acting than cocaine and thus are used fewer times per day. Usage may be chronic or\nepisodic, with binges punctuated by brief non-use periods. Aggressive or violent behavior\nis common when high doses are smoked, ingested, or administered intravenously. Intense\ntemporary anxiety resembling panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder, as well as\nparanoid ideation and psychotic episodes that resemble schizophrenia, is seen with high-\ndose use.\nWithdrawal states are associated with temporary but intense depressive symptoms that\ncan resemble a major depressive episode; the depressive symptoms usually resolve within\n1 week. Tolerance to amphetamine-type stimulants develops and leads to escalation of the\ndose. Conversely, some users of amphetamine-type stimulants develop sensitization,\ncharacterized by enhanced effects.The essential feature of stimulant intoxication, related to amphetamine-type stimulants\nand cocaine, is the presence of clinically significant behavioral or psychological changes\nthat develop during, or shortly after, use of stimulants (Criteria A and B). Auditory hallu-\ncinations may be prominent, as may paranoid ideation, and these symptoms must be dis-\ntinguished from an independent psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia. Stimulant\nintoxication usually begins with a “high” feeling and includes one or more of the follow-\ning: euphoria with enhanced vigor, gregariousness, hyperactivity, restlessness, hypervig-\nilance, interpersonal sensitivity, talkativeness, anxiety, tension, alertness, grandiosity,\nstereotyped and repetitive behavior, anger, impaired judgment, and, in the case of chronic\nintoxication, affective blunting with fatigue or sadness and social withdrawal. These be-\nhavioral and psychological changes are accompanied by two or more of the following\nsigns and symptoms that develop during or shortly after stimulant use: tachycardia or bra-\ndycardia; pupillary dilation; elevated or lowered blood pressure; perspiration or chills;\nnausea or vomiting; evidence of weight loss; psychomotor agitation or retardation; mus-\ncular weakness, respiratory depression, chest pain, or cardiac arrhythmias; and confu-\nsion, seizures, dyskinesias, dystonias, or coma (Criterion C). Intoxication, either acute or\nchronic, is often associated with impaired social or occupational functioning. Severe in-\ntoxication can lead to convulsions, cardiac arrhythmias, hyperpyrexia, and death. For the\ndiagnosis of stimulant intoxication to be made, the symptoms must not be attributable\nto another medical condition and not better explained by another mental disorder (Crite-\nrion D). While stimulant intoxication occurs in individuals with stimulant use disorders, in-\ntoxication is not a criterion for stimulant use disorder, which is confirmed by the presence\nof two of the 11 diagnostic criteria for use disorder.The essential feature of stimulant withdrawal is the presence of a characteristic with-\ndrawal syndrome that develops within a few hours to several days after the cessation of\n(or marked reduction in) stimulant use (generally high dose) that has been prolonged (Cri-\nterion A). The withdrawal syndrome is characterized by the development of dysphoric\nmood accompanied by two or more of the following physiological changes: fatigue, vivid\nand unpleasant dreams, insomnia or hypersomnia, increased appetite, and psychomotor\nretardation or agitation (Criterion B). Bradycardia is often present and is a reliable mea-\nsure of stimulant withdrawal.\nAnhedonia and drug craving can often be present but are not part of the diagnostic cri-\nteria. These symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-\npational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C). The symptoms must not be\nattributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental\ndisorder (Criterion D).\n570\nSubstance-Related and Addictive Disorders", "associated_features": "When injected or smoked, stimulants typically produce an instant feeling of well-being,\nconfidence, and euphoria. Dramatic behavioral changes can rapidly develop with stimu-\nlant use disorder. Chaotic behavior, social isolation, aggressive behavior, and sexual dys-\nfunction can result from long-term stimulant use disorder.\n564\nSubstance-Related and Addictive Disorders\nIndividuals with acute intoxication may present with rambling speech, headache, tran-\nsient ideas of reference, and tinnitus. There may be paranoid ideation, auditory halluci-\nnations in a clear sensorium, and tactile hallucinations, which the individual usually\nrecognizes as drug effects. Threats or acting out of aggressive behavior may occur. Depres-\nsion, suicidal ideation, irritability, anhedonia, emotional lability, or disturbances in atten-\ntion and concentration commonly occur during withdrawal. Mental disturbances associated\nwith cocaine use usually resolve hours to days after cessation of use but can persist for\n1 month. Physiological changes during stimulant withdrawal are opposite to those of the\nintoxication phase, sometimes including bradycardia. Temporary depressive symptoms\nmay meet symptomatic and duration criteria for major depressive episode. Histories con-\nsistent with repeated panic attacks, social anxiety disorder (social phobia)–like behavior,\nand generalized anxiety–like syndromes are common, as are eating disorders. One ex-\ntreme instance of stimulant toxicity is stimulant-induced psychotic disorder, a disorder\nthat resembles schizophrenia, with delusions and hallucinations.\nIndividuals with stimulant use disorder often develop conditioned responses to drug-\nrelated stimuli (e.g., craving on seeing any white powderlike substance). These responses\ncontribute to relapse, are difficult to extinguish, and persist after detoxification.\nDepressive symptoms with suicidal ideation or behavior can occur and are generally\nthe most serious problems seen during stimulant withdrawal.The magnitude and direction of the behavioral and physiological changes depend on many\nvariables, including the dose used and the characteristics of the individual using the sub-\nstance or the context (e.g., tolerance, rate of absorption, chronicity of use, context in which\nit is taken). Stimulant effects such as euphoria, increased pulse and blood pressure, and\npsychomotor activity are most commonly seen. Depressant effects such as sadness, brady-\ncardia, decreased blood pressure, and decreased psychomotor activity are less common\nand generally emerge only with chronic high-dose use.Acute withdrawal symptoms (“a crash”) are often seen after periods of repetitive high-dose\nuse (“runs” or “binges”). These periods are characterized by intense and unpleasant feelings of\nlassitude and depression and increased appetite, generally requiring several days of rest and\nrecuperation. Depressive symptoms with suicidal ideation or behavior can occur and are gen-\nerally the most serious problems seen during “crashing” or other forms of stimulant with-\ndrawal.

Certainly, milder forms can develop into more severe cases. Most individuals\nwith gambling disorder report that one or two types of gambling are most problematic for\nthem, although some individuals participate in many forms of gambling. Individuals are\nlikely to engage in certain types of gambling (e.g., buying scratch tickets daily) more fre-\nquently than others (e.g., playing slot machines or blackjack at the casino weekly). Fre-\nquency of gambling can be related more to the type of gambling than to the severity of the\noverall gambling disorder. For example, purchasing a single scratch ticket each day may\nnot be problematic, while less frequent casino, sports, or card gambling may be part of a\ngambling disorder.

Some individuals can wager thousands of dollars per\nmonth and not have a problem with gambling, while others may wager much smaller\namounts but experience substantial gambling-related difficulties.\nGambling patterns may be regular or episodic, and gambling disorder can be persis-\ntent or in remission.

There may be periods of heavy gambling\nand severe problems, times of total abstinence, and periods of nonproblematic gambling.\nGambling disorder is sometimes associated with spontaneous, long-term remissions.\nNevertheless, some individuals underestimate their vulnerability to develop gambling\ndisorder or to return to gambling disorder following remission.

The disorder has not been described in adults.\n270\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\nDisinhibited social engagement disorder has been described from the second year of\nlife through adolescence. There are some differences in manifestations of the disorder\nfrom early childhood through adolescence. At the youngest ages, across many cultures,\nchildren show reticence when interacting with strangers. Young children with the disorder\nfail to show reticence to approach, engage with, and even accompany adults. In preschool\nchildren, verbal and social intrusiveness appear most prominent, often accompanied by\nattention-seeking behavior. Verbal and physical overfamiliarity continue through middle\nchildhood, accompanied by inauthentic expressions of emotion. In adolescence, indis-\ncriminate behavior extends to peers. Relative to healthy adolescents, adolescents with the\ndisorder have more “superficial” peer relationships and more peer conflicts. Adult man-\nifestations of the disorder are unknown.", "risk_factors": "Environmental.\nSerious social neglect is a diagnostic requirement for disinhibited social\nengagement disorder and is also the only known risk factor for the disorder. However, the\nmajority of severely neglected children do not develop the disorder. Neurobiological vul-\nnerability may differentiate neglected children who do and do not develop the disorder.\nHowever, no clear link with any specific neurobiological factors has been established. The\ndisorder has not been identified in children who experience social neglect only after age\n2 years. Prognosis is only modestly associated with quality of the caregiving environment\nfollowing serious neglect. In many cases, the disorder persists, even in children whose\ncaregiving environment becomes markedly improved.\nCourse modifiers.\nCaregiving quality seems to moderate the course of disinhibited so-\ncial engagement disorder. Nevertheless, even after placement in normative caregiving\nenvironments, some children show persistent signs of the disorder, at least through ado-\nlescence.", "cultural_issues": "", "gender_issues": "", "diagnostic_markers": "", "suicide_risk": "", "functional_consequences": "Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder\nDisinhibited social engagement disorder significantly impairs young children’s abilities to\nrelate interpersonally to adults and peers.", "differential_diagnosis": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nBecause of social impulsivity that sometimes\naccompanies attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), it is necessary to differ-\nentiate the two disorders.
