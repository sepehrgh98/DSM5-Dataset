The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., the panic at-\ntacks do not occur only in response to feared social situations, as in social anxiety dis-\norder; in response to circumscribed phobic objects or situations, as in specific phobia;\nin response to obsessions, as in obsessive-compulsive disorder; in response to re-\nminders of traumatic events, as in posttraumatic stress disorder; or in response to sep-\naration from attachment figures, as in separation anxiety disorder).", "subtypes": "", "specifiers": "", "recording_procedures": "", "diagnostic_features": "Panic disorder refers to recurrent unexpected panic attacks (Criterion A). A panic attack is\nan abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes,\nand during which time four or more of a list of 13 physical and cognitive symptoms occur.\nThe term recurrent literally means more than one unexpected panic attack. The term unex-\npected refers to a panic attack for which there is no obvious cue or trigger at the time of oc-\ncurrence—that is, the attack appears to occur from out of the blue, such as when the\nindividual is relaxing or emerging from sleep (nocturnal panic attack). In contrast, expected\npanic attacks are attacks for which there is an obvious cue or trigger, such as a situation in\nwhich panic attacks typically occur. The determination of whether panic attacks are ex-\npected or unexpected is made by the clinician, who makes this judgment based on a com-\nbination of careful questioning as to the sequence of events preceding or leading up to the\nattack and the individual’s own judgment of whether or not the attack seemed to occur for\nno apparent reason. Cultural interpretations may influence the assignment of panic at-\ntacks as expected or unexpected (see section “Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues” for this\ndisorder). In the United States and Europe, approximately one-half of individuals with\npanic disorder have expected panic attacks as well as unexpected panic attacks. Thus, the\npresence of expected panic attacks does not rule out the diagnosis of panic disorder. For\nmore details regarding expected versus unexpected panic attacks, see the text accompa-\nnying panic attacks (pp. 214–217).\nThe frequency and severity of panic attacks vary widely. In terms of frequency, there\nmay be moderately frequent attacks (e.g., one per week) for months at a time, or short\nbursts of more frequent attacks (e.g., daily) separated by weeks or months without any at-\ntacks or with less frequent attacks (e.g., two per month) over many years. Persons who\nhave infrequent panic attacks resemble persons with more frequent panic attacks in terms\nof panic attack symptoms, demographic characteristics, comorbidity with other disorders,\nfamily history, and biological data. In terms of severity, individuals with panic disorder\nmay have both full-symptom (four or more symptoms) and limited-symptom (fewer than\nfour symptoms) attacks, and the number and type of panic attack symptoms frequently\ndiffer from one panic attack to the next. However, more than one unexpected full-symp-\ntom panic attack is required for the diagnosis of panic disorder.\nThe worries about panic attacks or their consequences usually pertain to physical con-\ncerns, such as worry that panic attacks reflect the presence of life-threatening illnesses\n(e.g., cardiac disease, seizure disorder); social concerns, such as embarrassment or fear of\nbeing judged negatively by others because of visible panic symptoms; and concerns about\nmental functioning, such as “going crazy” or losing control (Criterion B). The maladaptive\nchanges in behavior represent attempts to minimize or avoid panic attacks or their conse-\nquences. Examples include avoiding physical exertion, reorganizing daily life to ensure\nthat help is available in the event of a panic attack, restricting usual daily activities, and\navoiding agoraphobia-type situations, such as leaving home, using public transportation,\nor shopping. If agoraphobia is present, a separate diagnosis of agoraphobia is given.\n210\nAnxiety Disorders", "associated_features": "One type of unexpected panic attack is a nocturnal panic attack (i.e., waking from sleep in\na state of panic, which differs from panicking after fully waking from sleep). In the United\nStates, this type of panic attack has been estimated to occur at least one time in roughly\none-quarter to one-third of individuals with panic disorder, of whom the majority also\nhave daytime panic attacks. In addition to worry about panic attacks and their conse-\nquences, many individuals with panic disorder report constant or intermittent feelings of\nanxiety that are more broadly related to health and mental health concerns. For example,\nindividuals with panic disorder often anticipate a catastrophic outcome from a mild phys-\nical symptom or medication side effect (e.g., thinking that they may have heart disease or\nthat a headache means presence of a brain tumor). Such individuals often are relatively in-\ntolerant of medication side effects. In addition, there may be pervasive concerns about\nabilities to complete daily tasks or withstand daily stressors, excessive use of drugs (e.g.,\nalcohol, prescribed medications or illicit drugs) to control panic attacks, or extreme behav-\niors aimed at controlling panic attacks (e.g., severe restrictions on food intake or avoidance\nof specific foods or medications because of concerns about physical symptoms that pro-\nvoke panic attacks).", "prevalence": "In the general population, the 12-month prevalence estimate for panic disorder across the\nUnited States and several European countries is about 2%–3% in adults and adolescents. In\nthe United States, significantly lower rates of panic disorder are reported among Latinos,\nAfrican Americans, Caribbean blacks, and Asian Americans, compared with non-Latino\nwhites; American Indians, by contrast, have significantly higher rates. Lower estimates\nhave been reported for Asian, African, and Latin American countries, ranging from 0.1%\nto 0.8%. Females are more frequently affected than males, at a rate of approximately 2:1. The\ngender differentiation occurs in adolescence and is already observable before age 14 years.\nAlthough panic attacks occur in children, the overall prevalence of panic disorder is low\nbefore age 14 years (<0.4%). The rates of panic disorder show a gradual increase during ad-\nolescence, particularly in females, and possibly following the onset of puberty, and peak dur-\ning adulthood. The prevalence rates decline in older individuals (i.e., 0.7% in adults over\nthe age of 64), possibly reflecting diminishing severity to subclinical levels.", "development_course": "The median age at onset for panic disorder in the United States is 20–24 years. A small\nnumber of cases begin in childhood, and onset after age 45 years is unusual but can occur.\nThe usual course, if the disorder is untreated, is chronic but waxing and waning. Some in-\ndividuals may have episodic outbreaks with years of remission in between, and others\nmay have continuous severe symptomatology. Only a minority of individuals have full\nremission without subsequent relapse within a few years. The course of panic disorder\ntypically is complicated by a range of other disorders, in particular other anxiety disor-\nders, depressive disorders, and substance use disorders (see section “Comorbidity” for\nthis disorder).\nAlthough panic disorder is very rare in childhood, first occurrence of “fearful spells” is\noften dated retrospectively back to childhood. As in adults, panic disorder in adolescents\ntends to have a chronic course and is frequently comorbid with other anxiety, depressive,\nand bipolar disorders. To date, no differences in the clinical presentation between adoles-\ncents and adults have been found. However, adolescents may be less worried about addi-\ntional panic attacks than are young adults. Lower prevalence of panic disorder in older\nadults appears to be attributable to age-related “dampening” of the autonomic nervous\nsystem response. Many older individuals with “panicky feelings” are observed to have a\n“hybrid” of limited-symptom panic attacks and generalized anxiety. Also, older adults\nPanic Disorder\n211\ntend to attribute their panic attacks to certain stressful situations, such as a medical pro-\ncedure or social setting. Older individuals may retrospectively endorse explanations for\nthe panic attack (which would preclude the diagnosis of panic disorder), even if an attack\nmight actually have been unexpected in the moment (and thus qualify as the basis for a\npanic disorder diagnosis). This may result in under-endorsement of unexpected panic at-\ntacks in older individuals. Thus, careful questioning of older adults is required to assess\nwhether panic attacks were expected before entering the situation, so that unexpected\npanic attacks and the diagnosis of panic disorder are not overlooked.\nWhile the low rate of panic disorder in children could relate to difficulties in symptom\nreporting, this seems unlikely given that children are capable of reporting intense fear or\npanic in relation to separation and to phobic objects or phobic situations. Adolescents\nmight be less willing than adults to openly discuss panic attacks. Therefore, clinicians\nshould be aware that unexpected panic attacks do occur in adolescents, much as they do in\nadults, and be attuned to this possibility when encountering adolescents presenting with\nepisodes of intense fear or distress.", "risk_factors": "Temperamental.\nNegative affectivity (neuroticism) (i.e., proneness to experiencing neg-\native emotions) and anxiety sensitivity (i.e., the disposition to believe that symptoms of\nanxiety are harmful) are risk factors for the onset of panic attacks and, separately, for\nworry about panic, although their risk status for the diagnosis of panic disorder is un-\nknown. History of “fearful spells” (i.e., limited-symptom attacks that do not meet full cri-\nteria for a panic attack) may be a risk factor for later panic attacks and panic disorder.\nAlthough separation anxiety in childhood, especially when severe, may precede the later\ndevelopment of panic disorder, it is not a consistent risk factor.\nEnvironmental.\nReports of childhood experiences of sexual and physical abuse are more\ncommon in panic disorder than in certain other anxiety disorders. Smoking is a risk factor\nfor panic attacks and panic disorder. Most individuals report identifiable stressors in the\nmonths before their first panic attack (e.g., interpersonal stressors and stressors related to\nphysical well-being, such as negative experiences with illicit or prescription drugs, dis-\nease, or death in the family).\nGenetic and physiological.\nIt is believed that multiple genes confer vulnerability to panic\ndisorder. However, the exact genes, gene products, or functions related to the genetic re-\ngions implicated remain unknown. Current neural systems models for panic disorder em-\nphasize the amygdala and related structures, much as in other anxiety disorders. There is\nan increased risk for panic disorder among offspring of parents with anxiety, depressive,\nand bipolar disorders. Respiratory disturbance, such as asthma, is associated with panic\ndisorder, in terms of past history, comorbidity, and family history.", "cultural_issues": "The rate of fears about mental and somatic symptoms of anxiety appears to vary across\ncultures and may influence the rate of panic attacks and panic disorder. Also, cultural ex-\npectations may influence the classification of panic attacks as expected or unexpected. For\nexample, a Vietnamese individual who has a panic attack after walking out into a windy\nenvironment (trúng gió; “hit by the wind”) may attribute the panic attack to exposure to\nwind as a result of the cultural syndrome that links these two experiences, resulting in clas-\nsification of the panic attack as expected. Various other cultural syndromes are associated\nwith panic disorder, including ataque de nervios (“attack of nerves”) among Latin Ameri-\ncans and khyâl attacks and “soul loss” among Cambodians. Ataque de nervios may involve\ntrembling, uncontrollable screaming or crying, aggressive or suicidal behavior, and deper-\nsonalization or derealization, which may be experienced longer than the few minutes typical\n212\nAnxiety Disorders\nof panic attacks. Some clinical presentations of ataque de nervios fulfill criteria for condi-\ntions other than panic attack (e.g., other specified dissociative disorder). These syndromes\nimpact the symptoms and frequency of panic disorder, including the individual’s attribu-\ntion of unexpectedness, as cultural syndromes may create fear of certain situations, rang-\ning from interpersonal arguments (associated with ataque de nervios), to types of exertion\n(associated with khyâl attacks), to atmospheric wind (associated with trúng gió attacks).\nClarification of the details of cultural attributions may aid in distinguishing expected and\nunexpected panic attacks. For more information regarding cultural syndromes, refer to the\n“Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the Appendix.\nThe specific worries about panic attacks or their consequences are likely to vary from\none culture to another (and across different age groups and gender). For panic disorder,\nU.S. community samples of non-Latino whites have significantly less functional impair-\nment than African Americans. There are also higher rates of objectively defined severity in\nnon-Latino Caribbean blacks with panic disorder, and lower rates of panic disorder over-\nall in both African American and Afro-Caribbean groups, suggesting that among individ-\nuals of African descent, the criteria for panic disorder may be met only when there is\nsubstantial severity and impairment.", "gender_issues": "The clinical features of panic disorder do not appear to differ between males and females.\nThere is some evidence for sexual dimorphism, with an association between panic disor-\nder and the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene in females only.", "diagnostic_markers": "Agents with disparate mechanisms of action, such as sodium lactate, caffeine, isoprotere-\nnol, yohimbine, carbon dioxide, and cholecystokinin, provoke panic attacks in individuals\nwith panic disorder to a much greater extent than in healthy control subjects (and in some\ncases, than in individuals with other anxiety, depressive, or bipolar disorders without\npanic attacks). Also, for a proportion of individuals with panic disorder, panic attacks are\nrelated to hypersensitive medullary carbon dioxide detectors, resulting in hypocapnia and\nother respiratory irregularities. However, none of these laboratory findings are consid-\nered diagnostic of panic disorder.", "suicide_risk": "Panic attacks and a diagnosis of panic disorder in the past 12 months are related to a higher\nrate of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation in the past 12 months even when comorbid-\nity and a history of childhood abuse and other suicide risk factors are taken into account.", "functional_consequences": "Panic disorder is associated with high levels of social, occupational, and physical disabil-\nity; considerable economic costs; and the highest number of medical visits among the anx-\niety disorders, although the effects are strongest with the presence of agoraphobia.\nIndividuals with panic disorder may be frequently absent from work or school for doctor\nand emergency room visits, which can lead to unemployment or dropping out of school.\nIn older adults, impairment may be seen in caregiving duties or volunteer activities. Full-\nsymptom panic attacks typically are associated with greater morbidity (e.g., greater health\ncare utilization, more disability, poorer quality of life) than limited-symptom attacks.", "differential_diagnosis": "Other specified anxiety disorder or unspecified anxiety disorder.\nPanic disorder should\nnot be diagnosed if full-symptom (unexpected) panic attacks have never been experienced. In\nPanic Disorder\n213\nthe case of only limited-symptom unexpected panic attacks, an other specified anxiety dis-\norder or unspecified anxiety disorder diagnosis should be considered.\nAnxiety disorder due to another medical condition.\nPanic disorder is not diagnosed if\nthe panic attacks are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of another medical\ncondition. Examples of medical conditions that can cause panic attacks include hyperthy-\nroidism, hyperparathyroidism, pheochromocytoma, vestibular dysfunctions, seizure dis-\norders, and cardiopulmonary conditions (e.g., arrhythmias, supraventricular tachycardia,\nasthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]). Appropriate laboratory tests\n(e.g., serum calcium levels for hyperparathyroidism; Holter monitor for arrhythmias) or\nphysical examinations (e.g., for cardiac conditions) may be helpful in determining the eti-\nological role of another medical condition.\nSubstance/medication-induced anxiety disorder.\nPanic disorder is not diagnosed if\nthe panic attacks are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a substance. In-\ntoxication with central nervous system stimulants (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines, caffeine)\nor cannabis and withdrawal from central nervous system depressants (e.g., alcohol, bar-\nbiturates) can precipitate a panic attack. However, if panic attacks continue to occur out-\nside of the context of substance use (e.g., long after the effects of intoxication or withdrawal\nhave ended), a diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered. In addition, because\npanic disorder may precede substance use in some individuals and may be associated\nwith increased substance use, especially for purposes of self-medication, a detailed history\nshould be taken to determine if the individual had panic attacks prior to excessive sub-\nstance use. If this is the case, a diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered in addition\nto a diagnosis of substance use disorder. Features such as onset after age 45 years or the\npresence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack (e.g., vertigo, loss of consciousness,\nloss of bladder or bowel control, slurred speech, amnesia) suggest the possibility that an-\nother medical condition or a substance may be causing the panic attack symptoms.\nOther mental disorders with panic attacks as an associated feature (e.g., other anxiety\ndisorders and psychotic disorders).\nPanic attacks that occur as a symptom of other anx-\niety disorders are expected (e.g., triggered by social situations in social anxiety disorder, by\nphobic objects or situations in specific phobia or agoraphobia, by worry in generalized anx-\niety disorder, by separation from home or attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder)\nand thus would not meet criteria for panic disorder. (Note: Sometimes an unexpected panic\nattack is associated with the onset of another anxiety disorder, but then the attacks become\nexpected, whereas panic disorder is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks.) If\nthe panic attacks occur only in response to specific triggers, then only the relevant anxiety\ndisorder is assigned. However, if the individual experiences unexpected panic attacks as\nwell and shows persistent concern and worry or behavioral change because of the attacks,\nthen an additional diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered.", "comorbidity": "Panic disorder infrequently occurs in clinical settings in the absence of other psychopa-\nthology. The prevalence of panic disorder is elevated in individuals with other disorders,\nparticularly other anxiety disorders (and especially agoraphobia), major depression, bipo-\nlar disorder, and possibly mild alcohol use disorder. While panic disorder often has an ear-\nlier age at onset than the comorbid disorder(s), onset sometimes occurs after the comorbid\ndisorder and may be seen as a severity marker of the comorbid illness.\nReported lifetime rates of comorbidity between major depressive disorder and panic\ndisorder vary widely, ranging from 10% to 65% in individuals with panic disorder. In ap-\nproximately one-third of individuals with both disorders, the depression precedes the on-\nset of panic disorder. In the remaining two-thirds, depression occurs coincident with or\nfollowing the onset of panic disorder. A subset of individuals with panic disorder develop\na substance-related disorder, which for some represents an attempt to treat their anxiety\n214\nAnxiety Disorders\nwith alcohol or medications. Comorbidity with other anxiety disorders and illness anxiety\ndisorder is also common.\nPanic disorder is significantly comorbid with numerous general medical symptoms\nand conditions, including, but not limited to, dizziness, cardiac arrhythmias, hyperthy-\nroidism, asthma, COPD, and irritable bowel syndrome. However, the nature of the asso-\nciation (e.g., cause and effect) between panic disorder and these conditions remains\nunclear.

The intensity, duration, or\nfrequency of the anxiety and worry is out of proportion to the actual likelihood or impact\nof the anticipated event. The individual finds it difficult to control the worry and to keep\nworrisome thoughts from interfering with attention to tasks at hand. Adults with gener-\nalized anxiety disorder often worry about everyday, routine life circumstances, such as\npossible job responsibilities, health and finances, the health of family members, misfor-\ntune to their children, or minor matters (e.g., doing household chores or being late for ap-\npointments). Children with generalized anxiety disorder tend to worry excessively about\ntheir competence or the quality of their performance. During the course of the disorder,\nthe focus of worry may shift from one concern to another.\nSeveral features distinguish generalized anxiety disorder from nonpathological anxiety.\nFirst, the worries associated with generalized anxiety disorder are excessive and typically in-\nterfere significantly with psychosocial functioning, whereas the worries of everyday life\nare not excessive and are perceived as more manageable and may be put off when more\npressing matters arise. Second, the worries associated with generalized anxiety disorder are\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder\n223\nmore pervasive, pronounced, and distressing; have longer duration; and frequently occur\nwithout precipitants. The greater the range of life circumstances about which a person\nworries (e.g., finances, children’s safety, job performance), the more likely his or her symp-\ntoms are to meet criteria for generalized anxiety disorder. Third, everyday worries are much\nless likely to be accompanied by physical symptoms (e.g., restlessness or feeling keyed up\nor on edge). Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder report subjective distress due\nto constant worry and related impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas\nof functioning.\nThe anxiety and worry are accompanied by at least three of the following additional\nsymptoms: restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty\nconcentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension, and disturbed sleep, al-\nthough only one additional symptom is required in children.", "associated_features": "Associated with muscle tension, there may be trembling, twitching, feeling shaky, and\nmuscle aches or soreness. Many individuals with generalized anxiety disorder also expe-\nrience somatic symptoms (e.g., sweating, nausea, diarrhea) and an exaggerated startle re-\nsponse. Symptoms of autonomic hyperarousal (e.g., accelerated heart rate, shortness of\nbreath, dizziness) are less prominent in generalized anxiety disorder than in other anxiety\ndisorders, such as panic disorder.

The median age at onset for generalized anxiety disorder is 30\nyears; however, age at onset is spread over a very broad range. The median age at onset is\nlater than that for the other anxiety disorders. The symptoms of excessive worry and anx-\niety may occur early in life but are then manifested as an anxious temperament.

Rates of full remission are very low.\nThe clinical expression of generalized anxiety disorder is relatively consistent across\nthe lifespan. The primary difference across age groups is in the content of the individual’s\nworry. Children and adolescents tend to worry more about school and sporting perfor-\nmance, whereas older adults report greater concern about the well-being of family or their\nown physical heath. Thus, the content of an individual’s worry tends to be age appropri-\nate. Younger adults experience greater severity of symptoms than do older adults.\nThe earlier in life individuals have symptoms that meet criteria for generalized anxiety\ndisorder, the more comorbidity they tend to have and the more impaired they are likely to\n224\nAnxiety Disorders\nbe.

In those with early cognitive impairment, what appears to be excessive worry\nabout, for example, the whereabouts of things is probably better regarded as realistic\ngiven the cognitive impairment.\nIn children and adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder, the anxieties and wor-\nries often concern the quality of their performance or competence at school or in sporting\nevents, even when their performance is not being evaluated by others. There may be ex-\ncessive concerns about punctuality. They may also worry about catastrophic events, such\nas earthquakes or nuclear war. Children with the disorder may be overly conforming, per-\nfectionist, and unsure of themselves and tend to redo tasks because of excessive dissatis-\nfaction with less-than-perfect performance. They are typically overzealous in seeking\nreassurance and approval and require excessive reassurance about their performance and\nother things they are worried about.\nGeneralized anxiety disorder may be overdiagnosed in children.

In generalized anxiety disorder the focus of the worry is about forthcoming prob-\nlems, and it is the excessiveness of the worry about future events that is abnormal. In\nobsessive-compulsive disorder, the obsessions are inappropriate ideas that take the form of\nintrusive and unwanted thoughts, urges, or images.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder and adjustment disorders.\nAnxiety is invariably pres-\nent in posttraumatic stress disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder is not diagnosed if the\nanxiety and worry are better explained by symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder.\nAnxiety may also be present in adjustment disorder, but this residual category should be\nused only when the criteria are not met for any other disorder (including generalized anx-\niety disorder). Moreover, in adjustment disorders, the anxiety occurs in response to an\nidentifiable stressor within 3 months of the onset of the stressor and does not persist for\nmore than 6 months after the termination of the stressor or its consequences.\nDepressive, bipolar, and psychotic disorders.\nGeneralized anxiety/worry is a common\nassociated feature of depressive, bipolar, and psychotic disorders and should not be di-\n226\nAnxiety Disorders\nagnosed separately if the excessive worry has occurred only during the course of these\nconditions.", "comorbidity": "Individuals whose presentation meets criteria for generalized anxiety disorder are likely\nto have met, or currently meet, criteria for other anxiety and unipolar depressive disor-\nders.

A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood\nand abnormally and persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy, lasting at\nleast 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospi-\ntalization is necessary).\nB. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or\nmore) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a sig-\nnificant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior:\n1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.\n2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).\n3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.\n4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.\n5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external\nstimuli), as reported or observed.\n6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or\npsychomotor agitation (i.e., purposeless non-goal-directed activity).\n7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful conse-\nquences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or\nfoolish business investments).\nC. The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or\noccupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or oth-\ners, or there are psychotic features.\nD. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug\nof abuse, a medication, other treatment) or to another medical condition.\nNote: A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medi-\ncation, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the\nphysiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and,\ntherefore, a bipolar I diagnosis.\nNote: Criteria A–D constitute a manic episode. At least one lifetime manic episode is re-\nquired for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.\nHypomanic Episode\nA. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood\nand abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 4 consec-\nutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day.\nB. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and activity, three (or\nmore) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) have persisted, rep-\nresent a noticeable change from usual behavior, and have been present to a significant\ndegree:\n1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.\n2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).\n3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.\n4.

Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or\npsychomotor agitation.\n7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful conse-\nquences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or\nfoolish business investments).\nBipolar I Disorder\n125\nC. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is uncharac-\nteristic of the individual when not symptomatic.\nD. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable by others.\nE. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupa-\ntional functioning or to necessitate hospitalization. If there are psychotic features, the\nepisode is, by definition, manic.\nF. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug\nof abuse, a medication, other treatment).\nNote: A full hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g.,\nmedication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond\nthe physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a hypomanic episode\ndiagnosis. However, caution is indicated so that one or two symptoms (particularly in-\ncreased irritability, edginess, or agitation following antidepressant use) are not taken\nas sufficient for diagnosis of a hypomanic episode, nor necessarily indicative of a bi-\npolar diathesis.\nNote: Criteria A–F constitute a hypomanic episode. Hypomanic episodes are common in\nbipolar I disorder but are not required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.\nMajor Depressive Episode\nA. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week\nperiod and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms\nis either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.\nNote: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical condi-\ntion.\n1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjec-\ntive report (e.g., feels sad, empty, or hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g.,\nappears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)\n2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the\nday, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation).\n3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than\n5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every\nday. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)\n4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.\n5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others; not\nmerely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).\n6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.\n7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delu-\nsional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).\n8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (ei-\nther by subjective account or as observed by others).\n9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation with-\nout a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.\nB. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning.\nC. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another\nmedical condition.\nNote: Criteria A–C constitute a major depressive episode. Major depressive episodes are\ncommon in bipolar I disorder but are not required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.\nNote: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a\nnatural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense\n126\nBipolar and Related Disorders\nsadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Cri-\nterion A, which may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms may be un-\nderstandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive\nepisode in addition to the normal response to a significant loss should also be carefully\nconsidered. This decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on\nthe individual’s history and the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context\nof loss.1\nBipolar I Disorder\nA. Criteria have been met for at least one manic episode (Criteria A–D under “Manic Ep-\nisode” above).\nB. The occurrence of the manic and major depressive episode(s) is not better explained\nby schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional dis-\norder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic\ndisorder.\nCoding and Recording Procedures\nThe diagnostic code for bipolar I disorder is based on type of current or most recent epi-\nsode and its status with respect to current severity, presence of psychotic features, and\nremission status. Current severity and psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria\nare currently met for a manic or major depressive episode. Remission specifiers are only\nindicated if the full criteria are not currently met for a manic, hypomanic, or major depres-\nsive episode. Codes are as follows:\n1In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that in\ngrief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss, while in MDE it is persistent\ndepressed mood and the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is\nlikely to decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of\ngrief. These waves tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The\ndepressed mood of a MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations.\nThe pain of grief may be accompanied by positive emotions and humor that are uncharacteristic\nof the pervasive unhappiness and misery characteristic of a major depressive episode. The\nthought content associated with grief generally features a preoccupation with thoughts and\nmemories of the deceased, rather than the self-critical or pessimistic ruminations seen in a MDE.\nIn grief, self-esteem is generally preserved, whereas in a MDE, feelings of worthlessness and self-\nloathing are common. If self-derogatory ideation is present in grief, it typically involves per-\nceived failings vis-à-vis the deceased (e.g., not visiting frequently enough, not telling the\ndeceased how much he or she was loved). If a bereaved individual thinks about death and dying,\nsuch thoughts are generally focused on the deceased and possibly about “joining” the deceased,\nwhereas in a major depressive episode such thoughts are focused on ending one’s own life\nbecause of feeling worthless, undeserving of life, or unable to cope with the pain of depression.\nBipolar I disorder\nCurrent or\nmost recent\nepisode\nmanic\nCurrent or\nmost recent\nepisode\nhypomanic*\nCurrent or\nmost recent\nepisode\ndepressed\nCurrent or\nmost recent\nepisode\nunspecified**\nMild (p. 154)\n296.41\n(F31.11)\nNA\n296.51\n(F31.31)\nNA\nModerate (p. 154)\n296.42\n(F31.12)\nNA\n296.52\n(F31.32)\nNA\nSevere (p. 154)\n296.43\n(F31.13)\nNA\n296.53\n(F31.4)\nNA\nBipolar I Disorder\n127\nIn recording the name of a diagnosis, terms should be listed in the following order: bipolar\nI disorder, type of current or most recent episode, severity/psychotic/remission specifiers,\nfollowed by as many specifiers without codes as apply to the current or most recent epi-\nsode.\nSpecify:\nWith anxious distress (p. 149)\nWith mixed features (pp. 149–150)\nWith rapid cycling (pp. 150–151)\nWith melancholic features (p. 151)\nWith atypical features (pp. 151–152)\nWith mood-congruent psychotic features (p. 152)\nWith mood-incongruent psychotic features (p. 152)\nWith catatonia (p. 152).

In children, happiness, silliness and\n“goofiness” are normal in the context of special occasions; however, if these symptoms are\nrecurrent, inappropriate to the context, and beyond what is expected for the developmen-\ntal level of the child, they may meet Criterion A. If the happiness is unusual for a child (i.e.,\ndistinct from baseline), and the mood change occurs at the same time as symptoms that\nmeet Criterion B for mania, diagnostic certainty is increased; however, the mood change\nmust be accompanied by persistently increased activity or energy levels that are obvious\nto those who know the child well.\nDuring the manic episode, the individual may engage in multiple overlapping new\nprojects. The projects are often initiated with little knowledge of the topic, and nothing seems\nout of the individual’s reach. The increased activity levels may manifest at unusual hours of\nthe day.\nInflated self-esteem is typically present, ranging from uncritical self-confidence to marked\ngrandiosity, and may reach delusional proportions (Criterion B1). Despite lack of any partic-\nular experience or talent, the individual may embark on complex tasks such as writing a novel\nor seeking publicity for some impractical invention. Grandiose delusions (e.g., of having a\nspecial relationship to a famous person) are common. In children, overestimation of abilities\nand belief that, for example, they are the best at a sport or the smartest in the class is normal;\nhowever, when such beliefs are present despite clear evidence to the contrary or the child at-\ntempts feats that are clearly dangerous and, most important, represent a change from the\nchild’s normal behavior, the grandiosity criterion should be considered satisfied.\nOne of the most common features is a decreased need for sleep (Criterion B2) and is\ndistinct from insomnia in which the individual wants to sleep or feels the need to sleep but\nis unable. The individual may sleep little, if at all, or may awaken several hours earlier than\nusual, feeling rested and full of energy. When the sleep disturbance is severe, the individ-\nual may go for days without sleep, yet not feel tired. Often a decreased need for sleep her-\nalds the onset of a manic episode.\nSpeech can be rapid, pressured, loud, and difficult to interrupt (Criterion B3). Individ-\nuals may talk continuously and without regard for others’ wishes to communicate, often\nin an intrusive manner or without concern for the relevance of what is said. Speech is\nsometimes characterized by jokes, puns, amusing irrelevancies, and theatricality, with\ndramatic mannerisms, singing, and excessive gesturing. Loudness and forcefulness of\nspeech often become more important than what is conveyed. If the individual’s mood is\nmore irritable than expansive, speech may be marked by complaints, hostile comments, or\nangry tirades, particularly if attempts are made to interrupt the individual. Both Criterion\nA and Criterion B symptoms may be accompanied by symptoms of the opposite (i.e., de-\npressive) pole (see “with mixed features” specifier, pp. 149–150).\nOften the individual’s thoughts race at a rate faster than they can be expressed through\nspeech (Criterion B4). Frequently there is flight of ideas evidenced by a nearly continuous flow\nof accelerated speech, with abrupt shifts from one topic to another. When flight of ideas is se-\nvere, speech may become disorganized, incoherent, and particularly distressful to the individ-\nual. Sometimes thoughts are experienced as so crowded that it is very difficult to speak.\nDistractibility (Criterion B5) is evidenced by an inability to censor immaterial external\nstimuli (e.g., the interviewer’s attire, background noises or conversations, furnishings in\nthe room) and often prevents individuals experiencing mania from holding a rational con-\nversation or attending to instructions.\nThe increase in goal-directed activity often consists of excessive planning and partici-\npation in multiple activities, including sexual, occupational, political, or religious activi-\nties. Increased sexual drive, fantasies, and behavior are often present. Individuals in a manic\nepisode usually show increased sociability (e.g., renewing old acquaintances or calling or\ncontacting friends or even strangers), without regard to the intrusive, domineering, and\ndemanding nature of these interactions. They often display psychomotor agitation or rest-\nlessness (i.e., purposeless activity) by pacing or by holding multiple conversations simulta-\nBipolar I Disorder\n129\nneously. Some individuals write excessive letters, e-mails, text messages, and so forth, on\nmany different topics to friends, public figures, or the media.\nThe increased activity criterion can be difficult to ascertain in children; however, when\nthe child takes on many tasks simultaneously, starts devising elaborate and unrealistic\nplans for projects, develops previously absent and developmentally inappropriate sexual\npreoccupations (not accounted for by sexual abuse or exposure to sexually explicit mate-\nrial), then Criterion B might be met based on clinical judgment. It is essential to determine\nwhether the behavior represents a change from the child’s baseline behavior; occurs most\nof the day, nearly every day for the requisite time period; and occurs in temporal associa-\ntion with other symptoms of mania.\nThe expansive mood, excessive optimism, grandiosity, and poor judgment often lead\nto reckless involvement in activities such as spending sprees, giving away possessions,\nreckless driving, foolish business investments, and sexual promiscuity that is unusual for\nthe individual, even though these activities are likely to have catastrophic consequences\n(Criterion B7). The individual may purchase many unneeded items without the money to\npay for them and, in some cases, give them away. Sexual behavior may include infidelity\nor indiscriminate sexual encounters with strangers, often disregarding the risk of sexually\ntransmitted diseases or interpersonal consequences.\nThe manic episode must result in marked impairment in social or occupational func-\ntioning or require hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others (e.g., financial losses, il-\nlegal activities, loss of employment, self-injurious behavior). By definition, the presence of\npsychotic features during a manic episode also satisfies Criterion C.\nManic symptoms or syndromes that are attributable to the physiological effects of a\ndrug of abuse (e.g., in the context of cocaine or amphetamine intoxication), the side effects\nof medications or treatments (e.g., steroids, L-dopa, antidepressants, stimulants), or an-\nother medical condition do not count toward the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. However,\na fully syndromal manic episode that arises during treatment (e.g., with medications, elec-\ntroconvulsive therapy, light therapy) or drug use and persists beyond the physiological ef-\nfect of the inducing agent (i.e., after a medication is fully out of the individual’s system or\nthe effects of electroconvulsive therapy would be expected to have dissipated completely)\nis sufficient evidence for a manic episode diagnosis (Criterion D). Caution is indicated so\nthat one or two symptoms (particularly increased irritability, edginess, or agitation follow-\ning antidepressant use) are not taken as sufficient for diagnosis of a manic or hypomanic\nepisode, nor necessarily an indication of a bipolar disorder diathesis. It is necessary to\nmeet criteria for a manic episode to make a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, but it is not re-\nquired to have hypomanic or major depressive episodes. However, they may precede or\nfollow a manic episode. Full descriptions of the diagnostic features of a hypomanic epi-\nsode may be found within the text for bipolar II disorder, and the features of a major de-\npressive episode are described within the text for major depressive disorder.", "associated_features": "During a manic episode, individuals often do not perceive that they are ill or in need of treat-\nment and vehemently resist efforts to be treated. Individuals may change their dress, makeup,\nor personal appearance to a more sexually suggestive or flamboyant style. Some perceive a\nsharper sense of smell, hearing, or vision. Gambling and antisocial behaviors may accompany\nthe manic episode. Some individuals may become hostile and physically threatening to others\nand, when delusional, may become physically assaultive or suicidal. Catastrophic conse-\nquences of a manic episode (e.g., involuntary hospitalization, difficulties with the law, serious\nfinancial difficulties) often result from poor judgment, loss of insight, and hyperactivity.\nMood may shift very rapidly to anger or depression. Depressive symptoms may occur\nduring a manic episode and, if present, may last moments, hours, or, more rarely, days (see\n“with mixed features” specifier, pp. 149–150).\n130\nBipolar and Related Disorders", "prevalence": "The 12-month prevalence estimate in the continental United States was 0.6% for bipolar I\ndisorder as defined in DSM-IV.

Since children of the same chronological age may be at different\ndevelopmental stages, it is difficult to define with precision what is “normal” or “ex-\npected” at any given point. Therefore, each child should be judged according to his or her\nown baseline. Onset occurs throughout the life cycle, including first onsets in the 60s or\n70s. Onset of manic symptoms (e.g., sexual or social disinhibition) in late mid-life or late-\nlife should prompt consideration of medical conditions (e.g., frontotemporal neurocogni-\ntive disorder) and of substance ingestion or withdrawal.\nMore than 90% of individuals who have a single manic episode go on to have recurrent\nmood episodes. Approximately 60% of manic episodes occur immediately before a major\ndepressive episode.

Similarly, symptoms of posttraumatic\nstress disorder need to be differentiated from bipolar disorder. It is helpful to assess the ep-\nisodic nature of the symptoms described, as well as to consider symptom triggers, in mak-\ning this differential diagnosis.\nSubstance/medication-induced bipolar disorder.\nSubstance use disorders may mani-\nfest with substance.medication-induced manic symptoms that must be distinguished\nfrom bipolar I disorder; response to mood stabilizers during a substance/medication-\ninduced mania may not necessarily be diagnostic for bipolar disorder.

A primary diagnosis of bipolar disorder must be estab-\nlished based on symptoms that remain once substances are no longer being used.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nThis disorder may be misdiagnosed as bipolar\ndisorder, especially in adolescents and children. Many symptoms overlap with the symp-\n132\nBipolar and Related Disorders\ntoms of mania, such as rapid speech, racing thoughts, distractibility, and less need for\nsleep. The “double counting” of symptoms toward both ADHD and bipolar disorder can\nbe avoided if the clinician clarifies whether the symptom(s) represents a distinct episode.\nPersonality disorders.\nPersonality disorders such as borderline personality disorder\nmay have substantial symptomatic overlap with bipolar disorders, since mood lability\nand impulsivity are common in both conditions. Symptoms must represent a distinct ep-\nisode, and the noticeable increase over baseline required for the diagnosis of bipolar dis-\norder must be present. A diagnosis of a personality disorder should not be made during an\nuntreated mood episode.\nDisorders with prominent irritability.\nIn individuals with severe irritability, particularly\nchildren and adolescents, care must be taken to apply the diagnosis of bipolar disorder\nonly to those who have had a clear episode of mania or hypomania—that is, a distinct time\nperiod, of the required duration, during which the irritability was clearly different from\nthe individual’s baseline and was accompanied by the onset of Criterion B symptoms.\nWhen a child’s irritability is persistent and particularly severe, the diagnosis of disruptive\nmood dysregulation disorder would be more appropriate.

The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or to another\nmedical condition.\nNote: Criteria A–C represent a major depressive episode.\nNote: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a nat-\nural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense sad-\nness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion A,\nwhich may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms may be understand-\nable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive episode in\naddition to the normal response to a significant loss should also be carefully considered. This\ndecision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual’s history\nand the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss.1\nD. The occurrence of the major depressive episode is not better explained by schizoaf-\nfective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or\nother specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.\nE. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode.\nNote: This exclusion does not apply if all of the manic-like or hypomanic-like episodes\nare substance-induced or are attributable to the physiological effects of another med-\nical condition.\n1In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that in\ngrief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss, while in MDE it is persistent\ndepressed mood and the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is\nlikely to decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of\ngrief. These waves tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The\ndepressed mood of MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations.\nThe pain of grief may be accompanied by positive emotions and humor that are uncharacteristic\nof the pervasive unhappiness and misery characteristic of MDE. The thought content associated\nwith grief generally features a preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the deceased,\nrather than the self-critical or pessimistic ruminations seen in MDE. In grief, self-esteem is gener-\nally preserved, whereas in MDE feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common. If self-\nderogatory ideation is present in grief, it typically involves perceived failings vis-à-vis the\ndeceased (e.g., not visiting frequently enough, not telling the deceased how much he or she was\nloved). If a bereaved individual thinks about death and dying, such thoughts are generally\nfocused on the deceased and possibly about “joining” the deceased, whereas in MDE such\nthoughts are focused on ending one’s own life because of feeling worthless, undeserving of life,\nor unable to cope with the pain of depression.\n162\nDepressive Disorders\nCoding and Recording Procedures\nThe diagnostic code for major depressive disorder is based on whether this is a single or\nrecurrent episode, current severity, presence of psychotic features, and remission status.\nCurrent severity and psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria are currently met\nfor a major depressive episode. Remission specifiers are only indicated if the full criteria\nare not currently met for a major depressive episode. Codes are as follows:\nIn recording the name of a diagnosis, terms should be listed in the following order: major\ndepressive disorder, single or recurrent episode, severity/psychotic/remission specifiers,\nfollowed by as many of the following specifiers without codes that apply to the current\nepisode.\nSpecify:\nWith anxious distress (p. 184)\nWith mixed features (pp. 184–185)\nWith melancholic features (p. 185)\nWith atypical features (pp. 185–186)\nWith mood-congruent psychotic features (p. 186)\nWith mood-incongruent psychotic features (p. 186)\nWith catatonia (p. 186).

Sadness may be de-\nnied at first but may be elicited through interview or inferred from facial expression and\ndemeanor. With individuals who focus on a somatic complaint, clinicians should de-\ntermine whether the distress from that complaint is associated with specific depressive\nsymptoms.

In children and adolescents, the mood may be irritable rather than sad.\nThe individual must also experience at least four additional symptoms drawn from a list\nthat includes changes in appetite or weight, sleep, and psychomotor activity; decreased en-\nergy; feelings of worthlessness or guilt; difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making deci-\nsions; or recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation or suicide plans or attempts. To\ncount toward a major depressive episode, a symptom must either be newly present or must\nhave clearly worsened compared with the person’s pre-episode status. The symptoms\nmust persist for most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 2 consecutive weeks. The ep-\nisode must be accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-\npational, or other important areas of functioning. For some individuals with milder\nepisodes, functioning may appear to be normal but requires markedly increased effort.\nThe mood in a major depressive episode is often described by the person as depressed,\nsad, hopeless, discouraged, or “down in the dumps” (Criterion A1). In some cases, sadness\nmay be denied at first but may subsequently be elicited by interview (e.g., by pointing out\nthat the individual looks as if he or she is about to cry). In some individuals who complain\nof feeling “blah,” having no feelings, or feeling anxious, the presence of a depressed mood\ncan be inferred from the person’s facial expression and demeanor. Some individuals em-\nphasize somatic complaints (e.g., bodily aches and pains) rather than reporting feelings of\nsadness. Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability (e.g., persistent anger, a\ntendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming others, an exaggerated\nsense of frustration over minor matters). In children and adolescents, an irritable or cranky\nmood may develop rather than a sad or dejected mood. This presentation should be dif-\nferentiated from a pattern of irritability when frustrated.\nLoss of interest or pleasure is nearly always present, at least to some degree. Individ-\nuals may report feeling less interested in hobbies, “not caring anymore,” or not feeling any\nenjoyment in activities that were previously considered pleasurable (Criterion A2). Family\nmembers often notice social withdrawal or neglect of pleasurable avocations (e.g., a for-\nmerly avid golfer no longer plays, a child who used to enjoy soccer finds excuses not to\npractice). In some individuals, there is a significant reduction from previous levels of sex-\nual interest or desire.\nAppetite change may involve either a reduction or increase. Some depressed individ-\nuals report that they have to force themselves to eat. Others may eat more and may crave\nspecific foods (e.g., sweets or other carbohydrates). When appetite changes are severe (in\neither direction), there may be a significant loss or gain in weight, or, in children, a failure\nto make expected weight gains may be noted (Criterion A3).\nSleep disturbance may take the form of either difficulty sleeping or sleeping exces-\nsively (Criterion A4). When insomnia is present, it typically takes the form of middle in-\nsomnia (i.e., waking up during the night and then having difficulty returning to sleep) or\nterminal insomnia (i.e., waking too early and being unable to return to sleep). Initial in-\nsomnia (i.e., difficulty falling asleep) may also occur. Individuals who present with over-\nsleeping (hypersomnia) may experience prolonged sleep episodes at night or increased\ndaytime sleep. Sometimes the reason that the individual seeks treatment is for the dis-\nturbed sleep.\nPsychomotor changes include agitation (e.g., the inability to sit still, pacing, hand-\nwringing; or pulling or rubbing of the skin, clothing, or other objects) or retardation (e.g.,\nslowed speech, thinking, and body movements; increased pauses before answering;\nspeech that is decreased in volume, inflection, amount, or variety of content, or muteness)\n(Criterion A5). The psychomotor agitation or retardation must be severe enough to be ob-\nservable by others and not represent merely subjective feelings.\nDecreased energy, tiredness, and fatigue are common (Criterion A6). A person may re-\nport sustained fatigue without physical exertion. Even the smallest tasks seem to require\n164\nDepressive Disorders\nsubstantial effort. The efficiency with which tasks are accomplished may be reduced. For\nexample, an individual may complain that washing and dressing in the morning are ex-\nhausting and take twice as long as usual.\nThe sense of worthlessness or guilt associated with a major depressive episode may in-\nclude unrealistic negative evaluations of one’s worth or guilty preoccupations or rumina-\ntions over minor past failings (Criterion A7). Such individuals often misinterpret neutral\nor trivial day-to-day events as evidence of personal defects and have an exaggerated sense\nof responsibility for untoward events. The sense of worthlessness or guilt may be of delu-\nsional proportions (e.g., an individual who is convinced that he or she is personally re-\nsponsible for world poverty). Blaming oneself for being sick and for failing to meet\noccupational or interpersonal responsibilities as a result of the depression is very common\nand, unless delusional, is not considered sufficient to meet this criterion.\nMany individuals report impaired ability to think, concentrate, or make even minor\ndecisions (Criterion A8). They may appear easily distracted or complain of memory diffi-\nculties. Those engaged in cognitively demanding pursuits are often unable to function. In\nchildren, a precipitous drop in grades may reflect poor concentration. In elderly individ-\nuals, memory difficulties may be the chief complaint and may be mistaken for early signs\nof a dementia (“pseudodementia”). When the major depressive episode is successfully\ntreated, the memory problems often fully abate. However, in some individuals, particu-\nlarly elderly persons, a major depressive episode may sometimes be the initial presenta-\ntion of an irreversible dementia.\nThoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts (Criterion A9) are common.\nThey may range from a passive wish not to awaken in the morning or a belief that others\nwould be better off if the individual were dead, to transient but recurrent thoughts of com-\nmitting suicide, to a specific suicide plan. More severely suicidal individuals may have put\ntheir affairs in order (e.g., updated wills, settled debts), acquired needed materials (e.g., a\nrope or a gun), and chosen a location and time to accomplish the suicide. Motivations for\nsuicide may include a desire to give up in the face of perceived insurmountable obstacles,\nan intense wish to end what is perceived as an unending and excruciatingly painful emo-\ntional state, an inability to foresee any enjoyment in life, or the wish to not be a burden to\nothers. The resolution of such thinking may be a more meaningful measure of diminished", "associated_features": "Major depressive disorder is associated with high mortality, much of which is accounted\nfor by suicide; however, it is not the only cause. For example, depressed individuals ad-\nmitted to nursing homes have a markedly increased likelihood of death in the first year. In-\ndividuals frequently present with tearfulness, irritability, brooding, obsessive rumination,\nanxiety, phobias, excessive worry over physical health, and complaints of pain (e.g., head-\naches; joint, abdominal, or other pains). In children, separation anxiety may occur.\nMajor Depressive Disorder\n165\nAlthough an extensive literature exists describing neuroanatomical, neuroendocrino-\nlogical, and neurophysiological correlates of major depressive disorder, no laboratory test\nhas yielded results of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as a diagnostic tool for\nthis disorder. Until recently, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity had been\nthe most extensively investigated abnormality associated with major depressive episodes,\nand it appears to be associated with melancholia, psychotic features, and risks for eventual\nsuicide. Molecular studies have also implicated peripheral factors, including genetic vari-\nants in neurotrophic factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging studies provide evidence for functional abnormalities in spe-\ncific neural systems supporting emotion processing, reward seeking, and emotion regula-\ntion in adults with major depression.", "prevalence": "Twelve-month prevalence of major depressive disorder in the United States is approximately\n7%, with marked differences by age group such that the prevalence in 18- to 29-year-old indi-\nviduals is threefold higher than the prevalence in individuals age 60 years or older. Females ex-\nperience 1.5- to 3-fold higher rates than males beginning in early adolescence.", "development_course": "Major depressive disorder may first appear at any age, but the likelihood of onset in-\ncreases markedly with puberty. In the United States, incidence appears to peak in the 20s;\nhowever, first onset in late life is not uncommon.\nThe course of major depressive disorder is quite variable, such that some individuals\nrarely, if ever, experience remission (a period of 2 or more months with no symptoms, or\nonly one or two symptoms to no more than a mild degree), while others experience many\nyears with few or no symptoms between discrete episodes. It is important to distinguish\nindividuals who present for treatment during an exacerbation of a chronic depressive ill-\nness from those whose symptoms developed recently. Chronicity of depressive symptoms\nsubstantially increases the likelihood of underlying personality, anxiety, and substance\nuse disorders and decreases the likelihood that treatment will be followed by full symp-\ntom resolution. It is therefore useful to ask individuals presenting with depressive symp-\ntoms to identify the last period of at least 2 months during which they were entirely free of\ndepressive symptoms.\nRecovery typically begins within 3 months of onset for two in five individuals with ma-\njor depression and within 1 year for four in five individuals. Recency of onset is a strong\ndeterminant of the likelihood of near-term recovery, and many individuals who have been\ndepressed only for several months can be expected to recover spontaneously. Features as-\nsociated with lower recovery rates, other than current episode duration, include psychotic\nfeatures, prominent anxiety, personality disorders, and symptom severity.\nThe risk of recurrence becomes progessively lower over time as the duration of re-\nmission increases. The risk is higher in individuals whose preceding episode was severe,\nin younger individuals, and in individuals who have already experienced multiple epi-\nsodes. The persistence of even mild depressive symptoms during remission is a powerful\npredictor of recurrence.\nMany bipolar illnesses begin with one or more depressive episodes, and a substantial\nproportion of individuals who initially appear to have major depressive disorder will\nprove, in time, to instead have a bipolar disorder. This is more likely in individuals with\nonset of the illness in adolescence, those with psychotic features, and those with a family\nhistory of bipolar illness. The presence of a “with mixed features” specifier also increases\nthe risk for future manic or hypomanic diagnosis. Major depressive disorder, particularly\nwith psychotic features, may also transition into schizophrenia, a change that is much\nmore frequent than the reverse.\n166\nDepressive Disorders\nDespite consistent differences between genders in prevalence rates for depressive disor-\nders, there appear to be no clear differences by gender in phenomenology, course, or treat-\nment response. Similarly, there are no clear effects of current age on the course or treatment\nresponse of major depressive disorder. Some symptom differences exist, though, such that\nhypersomnia and hyperphagia are more likely in younger individuals, and melancholic\nsymptoms, particularly psychomotor disturbances, are more common in older individuals.\nThe likelihood of suicide attempts lessens in middle and late life, although the risk of com-\npleted suicide does not. Depressions with earlier ages at onset are more familial and more\nlikely to involve personality disturbances. The course of major depressive disorder within\nindividuals does not generally change with aging. Mean times to recovery appear to be sta-\nble over long periods, and the likelihood of being in an episode does not generally increase\nor decrease with time.", "risk_factors": "Temperamental.\nNeuroticism (negative affectivity) is a well-established risk factor for the\nonset of major depressive disorder, and high levels appear to render individuals more likely\nto develop depressive episodes in response to stressful life events.\nEnvironmental.\nAdverse childhood experiences, particularly when there are multiple\nexperiences of diverse types, constitute a set of potent risk factors for major depressive dis-\norder. Stressful life events are well recognized as precipitants of major depressive epi-\nsodes, but the presence or absence of adverse life events near the onset of episodes does\nnot appear to provide a useful guide to prognosis or treatment selection.\nGenetic and physiological.\nFirst-degree family members of individuals with major de-\npressive disorder have a risk for major depressive disorder two- to fourfold higher than\nthat of the general population. Relative risks appear to be higher for early-onset and re-\ncurrent forms. Heritability is approximately 40%, and the personality trait neuroticism ac-\ncounts for a substantial portion of this genetic liability.\nCourse modifiers.\nEssentially all major nonmood disorders increase the risk of an indi-\nvidual developing depression. Major depressive episodes that develop against the back-\nground of another disorder often follow a more refractory course. Substance use, anxiety,\nand borderline personality disorders are among the most common of these, and the pre-\nsenting depressive symptoms may obscure and delay their recognition. However, sus-\ntained clinical improvement in depressive symptoms may depend on the appropriate\ntreatment of underlying illnesses. Chronic or disabling medical conditions also increase\nrisks for major depressive episodes. Such prevalent illnesses as diabetes, morbid obesity,\nand cardiovascular disease are often complicated by depressive episodes, and these epi-\nsodes are more likely to become chronic than are depressive episodes in medically healthy\nindividuals.", "cultural_issues": "Surveys of major depressive disorder across diverse cultures have shown sevenfold dif-\nferences in 12-month prevalence rates but much more consistency in female-to-male ratio,\nmean ages at onset, and the degree to which presence of the disorder raises the likelihood\nof comorbid substance abuse. While these findings suggest substantial cultural differences\nin the expression of major depressive disorder, they do not permit simple linkages be-\ntween particular cultures and the likelihood of specific symptoms. Rather, clinicians\nshould be aware that in most countries the majority of cases of depression go unrecog-\nnized in primary care settings and that in many cultures, somatic symptoms are very likely\nto constitute the presenting complaint. Among the Criterion A symptoms, insomnia and\nloss of energy are the most uniformly reported.\nMajor Depressive Disorder\n167", "gender_issues": "Although the most reproducible finding in the epidemiology of major depressive disorder\nhas been a higher prevalence in females, there are no clear differences between genders in\nsymptoms, course, treatment response, or functional consequences. In women, the risk for\nsuicide attempts is higher, and the risk for suicide completion is lower. The disparity in\nsuicide rate by gender is not as great among those with depressive disorders as it is in the\npopulation as a whole.", "diagnostic_markers": "", "suicide_risk": "The evaluation of the symptoms of a major depressive episode is especially difficult\nwhen they occur in an individual who also has a general medical condition (e.g., cancer,\nstroke, myocardial infarction, diabetes, pregnancy). Some of the criterion signs and symp-\ntoms of a major depressive episode are identical to those of general medical conditions\n(e.g., weight loss with untreated diabetes; fatigue with cancer; hypersomnia early in preg-\nnancy; insomnia later in pregnancy or the postpartum). Such symptoms count toward a\nmajor depressive diagnosis except when they are clearly and fully attributable to a general\nmedical condition. Nonvegetative symptoms of dysphoria, anhedonia, guilt or worthless-\nness, impaired concentration or indecision, and suicidal thoughts should be assessed with\nparticular care in such cases. Definitions of major depressive episodes that have been mod-\nified to include only these nonvegetative symptoms appear to identify nearly the same in-\ndividuals as do the full criteria.The possibility of suicidal behavior exists at all times during major depressive episodes.\nThe most consistently described risk factor is a past history of suicide attempts or threats,\nbut it should be remembered that most completed suicides are not preceded by unsuccess-\nful attempts. Other features associated with an increased risk for completed suicide\ninclude male sex, being single or living alone, and having prominent feelings of hopeless-\nness. The presence of borderline personality disorder markedly increases risk for future\nsuicide attempts.", "functional_consequences": "Major Depressive Disorder\nMany of the functional consequences of major depressive disorder derive from individual\nsymptoms. Impairment can be very mild, such that many of those who interact with the af-\nfected individual are unaware of depressive symptoms. Impairment may, however, range\nto complete incapacity such that the depressed individual is unable to attend to basic self-\ncare needs or is mute or catatonic. Among individuals seen in general medical settings,\nthose with major depressive disorder have more pain and physical illness and greater de-\ncreases in physical, social, and role functioning.", "differential_diagnosis": "Manic episodes with irritable mood or mixed episodes.\nMajor depressive episodes\nwith prominent irritable mood may be difficult to distinguish from manic episodes with\nirritable mood or from mixed episodes. This distinction requires a careful clinical evalua-\ntion of the presence of manic symptoms.\nMood disorder due to another medical condition.\nA major depressive episode is the\nappropriate diagnosis if the mood disturbance is not judged, based on individual history,\nphysical examination, and laboratory findings, to be the direct pathophysiological conse-\nquence of a specific medical condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis, stroke, hypothyroidism).\nSubstance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar disorder.\nThis disorder is distin-\nguished from major depressive disorder by the fact that a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse,\na medication, a toxin) appears to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance. For ex-\nample, depressed mood that occurs only in the context of withdrawal from cocaine would\nbe diagnosed as cocaine-induced depressive disorder.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nDistractibility and low frustration tolerance\ncan occur in both attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder and a major depressive epi-\nsode; if the criteria are met for both, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may be diag-\nnosed in addition to the mood disorder. However, the clinician must be cautious not to\noverdiagnose a major depressive episode in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity\ndisorder whose disturbance in mood is characterized by irritability rather than by sadness\nor loss of interest.\n168\nDepressive Disorders\nAdjustment disorder with depressed mood.\nA major depressive episode that occurs in\nresponse to a psychosocial stressor is distinguished from adjustment disorder with de-\npressed mood by the fact that the full criteria for a major depressive episode are not met in\nadjustment disorder.\nSadness.\nFinally, periods of sadness are inherent aspects of the human experience.\nThese periods should not be diagnosed as a major depressive episode unless criteria are\nmet for severity (i.e., five out of nine symptoms), duration (i.e., most of the day, nearly ev-\nery day for at least 2 weeks), and clinically significant distress or impairment.

Individuals whose symptoms meet major de-\npressive disorder criteria for 2 years should be given a diagnosis of persistent depressive\ndisorder as well as major depressive disorder.\nIndividuals with persistent depressive disorder describe their mood as sad or “down\nin the dumps.” During periods of depressed mood, at least two of the six symptoms from\nCriterion B are present. Because these symptoms have become a part of the individual’s\nday-to-day experience, particularly in the case of early onset (e.g., “I’ve always been this\n170\nDepressive Disorders\nway”), they may not be reported unless the individual is directly prompted. During the 2-year\nperiod (1 year for children or adolescents), any symptom-free intervals last no longer than\n2 months (Criterion C).", "associated_features": "", "prevalence": "Persistent depressive disorder is effectively an amalgam of DSM-IV dysthymic disorder and\nchronic major depressive episode. The 12-month prevalence in the United States is approxi-\nmately 0.5% for persistent depressive disorder and 1.5% for chronic major depressive disorder.", "development_course": "Persistent depressive disorder often has an early and insidious onset (i.e., in childhood,\nadolescence, or early adult life) and, by definition, a chronic course. Among individuals\nwith both persistent depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder, the covari-\nance of the corresponding features over time suggests the operation of a common mecha-\nnism. Early onset (i.e., before age 21 years) is associated with a higher likelihood of\ncomorbid personality disorders and substance use disorders.\nWhen symptoms rise to the level of a major depressive episode, they are likely to sub-\nsequently revert to a lower level. However, depressive symptoms are much less likely to\nresolve in a given period of time in the context of persistent depressive disorder than they\nare in a major depressive episode.", "risk_factors": "Temperamental.\nFactors predictive of poorer long-term outcome include higher levels\nof neuroticism (negative affectivity), greater symptom severity, poorer global functioning,\nand presence of anxiety disorders or conduct disorder.\nEnvironmental.\nChildhood risk factors include parental loss or separation.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThere are no clear differences in illness development, course,\nor family history between DSM-IV dysthymic disorder and chronic major depressive dis-\norder. Earlier findings pertaining to either disorder are therefore likely to apply to per-\nsistent depressive disorder. It is thus likely that individuals with persistent depressive\ndisorder will have a higher proportion of first-degree relatives with persistent depressive\ndisorder than do individuals with major depressive disorder, and more depressive disor-\nders in general.\nA number of brain regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, amygdala, hip-\npocampus) have been implicated in persistent depressive disorder.

The diagnosis depends on the 2-year duration,\nwhich distinguishes it from episodes of depression that do not last 2 years. If the symptom\nPremenstrual Dysphoric Disorder\n171\ncriteria are sufficient for a diagnosis of a major depressive episode at any time during this pe-\nriod, then the diagnosis of major depression should be noted, but it is coded not as a separate\ndiagnosis but rather as a specifier with the diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder. If the\nindividual’s symptoms currently meet full criteria for a major depressive episode, then the\nspecifier of “with intermittent major depressive episodes, with current episode” would be\nmade. If the major depressive episode has persisted for at least a 2-year duration and re-\nmains present, then the specifier “with persistent major depressive episode” is used. When\nfull major depressive episode criteria are not currently met but there has been at least one\nprevious episode of major depression in the context of at least 2 years of persistent depres-\nsive symptoms, then the specifier of “with intermittent major depressive episodes, without\ncurrent episode” is used. If the individual has not experienced an episode of major depres-\nsion in the last 2 years, then the specifier “with pure dysthymic syndrome” is used.\nPsychotic disorders.\nDepressive symptoms are a common associated feature of chronic\npsychotic disorders (e.g., schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, delusional disorder). A\nseparate diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder is not made if the symptoms occur\nonly during the course of the psychotic disorder (including residual phases).\nDepressive or bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition.\nPersistent\ndepressive disorder must be distinguished from a depressive or bipolar and related dis-\norder due to another medical condition. The diagnosis is depressive or bipolar and related\ndisorder due to another medical condition if the mood disturbance is judged, based on his-\ntory, physical examination, or laboratory findings, to be attributable to the direct patho-\nphysiological effects of a specific, usually chronic, medical condition (e.g., multiple\nsclerosis). If it is judged that the depressive symptoms are not attributable to the physiolog-\nical effects of another medical condition, then the primary mental disorder (e.g., persistent\ndepressive disorder) is recorded, and the medical condition is noted as a concomitant med-\nical condition (e.g., diabetes mellitus).\nSubstance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar disorder.\nA substance/medi-\ncation-induced depressive or bipolar and related disorder is distinguished from persis-\ntent depressive disorder when a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, a toxin) is\njudged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance.\nPersonality disorders.\nOften, there is evidence of a coexisting personality disturbance.\nWhen an individual’s presentation meets the criteria for both persistent depressive disor-\nder and a personality disorder, both diagnoses are given.", "comorbidity": "In comparison to individuals with major depressive disorder, those with persistent de-\npressive disorder are at higher risk for psychiatric comorbidity in general, and for anxiety\ndisorders and substance use disorders in particular.

The individual main-\ntains a body weight that is below a minimally normal level for age, sex, developmental tra-\njectory, and physical health (Criterion A). Individuals’ body weights frequently meet this\ncriterion following a significant weight loss, but among children and adolescents, there\nmay alternatively be failure to make expected weight gain or to maintain a normal devel-\nopmental trajectory (i.e., while growing in height) instead of weight loss.\n340\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\nCriterion A requires that the individual’s weight be significantly low (i.e., less than\nminimally normal or, for children and adolescents, less than that minimally expected).\nWeight assessment can be challenging because normal weight range differs among indi-\nviduals, and different thresholds have been published defining thinness or underweight\nstatus. Body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms/height in meters2) is a\nuseful measure to assess body weight for height. For adults, a BMI of 18.5 kg/m2 has been\nemployed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) as the lower limit of normal body weight. Therefore, most adults with\na BMI greater than or equal to 18.5 kg/m2 would not be considered to have a significantly\nlow body weight. On the other hand, a BMI of lower than 17.0 kg/m2 has been considered\nby the WHO to indicate moderate or severe thinness; therefore, an individual with a BMI\nless than 17.0 kg/m2 would likely be considered to have a significantly low weight. An\nadult with a BMI between 17.0 and 18.5 kg/m2, or even above 18.5 kg/m2, might be consid-\nered to have a significantly low weight if clinical history or other physiological informa-\ntion supports this judgment.\nFor children and adolescents, determining a BMI-for-age percentile is useful (see, e.g.,\nthe CDC BMI percentile calculator for children and teenagers. As for adults, it is not pos-\nsible to provide definitive standards for judging whether a child’s or an adolescent’s weight\nis significantly low, and variations in developmental trajectories among youth limit the\nutility of simple numerical guidelines. The CDC has used a BMI-for-age below the 5th per-\ncentile as suggesting underweight; however, children and adolescents with a BMI above\nthis benchmark may be judged to be significantly underweight in light of failure to main-\ntain their expected growth trajectory. In summary, in determining whether Criterion A is\nmet, the clinician should consider available numerical guidelines, as well as the individual’s\nbody build, weight history, and any physiological disturbances.\nIndividuals with this disorder typically display an intense fear of gaining weight or of\nbecoming fat (Criterion B). This intense fear of becoming fat is usually not alleviated by\nweight loss. In fact, concern about weight gain may increase even as weight falls. Younger\nindividuals with anorexia nervosa, as well as some adults, may not recognize or acknowl-\nedge a fear of weight gain. In the absence of another explanation for the significantly low\nweight, clinician inference drawn from collateral history, observational data, physical and\nlaboratory findings, or longitudinal course either indicating a fear of weight gain or sup-\nporting persistent behaviors that prevent it may be used to establish Criterion B.\nThe experience and significance of body weight and shape are distorted in these indi-\nviduals (Criterion C). Some individuals feel globally overweight. Others realize that they\nare thin but are still concerned that certain body parts, particularly the abdomen, buttocks,\nand thighs, are “too fat.” They may employ a variety of techniques to evaluate their body\nsize or weight, including frequent weighing, obsessive measuring of body parts, and per-\nsistent use of a mirror to check for perceived areas of “fat.” The self-esteem of individuals\nwith anorexia nervosa is highly dependent on their perceptions of body shape and weight.\nWeight loss is often viewed as an impressive achievement and a sign of extraordinary self-\ndiscipline, whereas weight gain is perceived as an unacceptable failure of self-control. Al-\nthough some individuals with this disorder may acknowledge being thin, they often do\nnot recognize the serious medical implications of their malnourished state.\nOften, the individual is brought to professional attention by family members after marked\nweight loss (or failure to make expected weight gains) has occurred. If individuals seek help\non their own, it is usually because of distress over the somatic and psychological sequelae\nof starvation. It is rare for an individual with anorexia nervosa to complain of weight loss\nper se. In fact, individuals with anorexia nervosa frequently either lack insight into or deny\nthe problem. It is therefore often important to obtain information from family members or\nother sources to evaluate the history of weight loss and other features of the illness.\nAnorexia Nervosa\n341", "associated_features": "The semi-starvation of anorexia nervosa, and the purging behaviors sometimes associated\nwith it, can result in significant and potentially life-threatening medical conditions. The\nnutritional compromise associated with this disorder affects most major organ systems\nand can produce a variety of disturbances. Physiological disturbances, including amenor-\nrhea and vital sign abnormalities, are common. While most of the physiological distur-\nbances associated with malnutrition are reversible with nutritional rehabilitation, some,\nincluding loss of bone mineral density, are often not completely reversible. Behaviors such\nas self-induced vomiting and misuse of laxatives, diuretics, and enemas may cause a num-\nber of disturbances that lead to abnormal laboratory findings; however, some individuals\nwith anorexia nervosa exhibit no laboratory abnormalities.\nWhen seriously underweight, many individuals with anorexia nervosa have depressive\nsigns and symptoms such as depressed mood, social withdrawal, irritability, insomnia, and\ndiminished interest in sex. Because these features are also observed in individuals without\nanorexia nervosa who are significantly undernourished, many of the depressive features\nmay be secondary to the physiological sequelae of semi-starvation, although they may also\nbe sufficiently severe to warrant an additional diagnosis of major depressive disorder.\nObsessive-compulsive features, both related and unrelated to food, are often prominent.\nMost individuals with anorexia nervosa are preoccupied with thoughts of food. Some col-\nlect recipes or hoard food. Observations of behaviors associated with other forms of star-\nvation suggest that obsessions and compulsions related to food may be exacerbated by\nundernutrition. When individuals with anorexia nervosa exhibit obsessions and compul-\nsions that are not related to food, body shape, or weight, an additional diagnosis of obses-\nsive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may be warranted.\nOther features sometimes associated with anorexia nervosa include concerns about\neating in public, feelings of ineffectiveness, a strong desire to control one’s environment,\ninflexible thinking, limited social spontaneity, and overly restrained emotional ex-\npression. Compared with individuals with anorexia nervosa, restricting type, those with\nbinge-eating/purging type have higher rates of impulsivity and are more likely to abuse\nalcohol and other drugs.\nA subgroup of individuals with anorexia nervosa show excessive levels of physical ac-\ntivity. Increases in physical activity often precede onset of the disorder, and over the\ncourse of the disorder increased activity accelerates weight loss. During treatment, exces-\nsive activity may be difficult to control, thereby jeopardizing weight recovery.\nIndividuals with anorexia nervosa may misuse medications, such as by manipulating\ndosage, in order to achieve weight loss or avoid weight gain. Individuals with diabetes\nmellitus may omit or reduce insulin doses in order to minimize carbohydrate metabolism.", "prevalence": "The 12-month prevalence of anorexia nervosa among young females is approximately\n0.4%. Less is known about prevalence among males, but anorexia nervosa is far less com-\nmon in males than in females, with clinical populations generally reflecting approximately\na 10:1 female-to-male ratio.", "development_course": "Anorexia nervosa commonly begins during adolescence or young adulthood. It rarely be-\ngins before puberty or after age 40, but cases of both early and late onset have been de-\nscribed. The onset of this disorder is often associated with a stressful life event, such as\nleaving home for college. The course and outcome of anorexia nervosa are highly variable.\nYounger individuals may manifest atypical features, including denying “fear of fat.” Older\n342\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\nindividuals more likely have a longer duration of illness, and their clinical presentation may\ninclude more signs and symptoms of long-standing disorder. Clinicians should not exclude\nanorexia nervosa from the differential diagnosis solely on the basis of older age.\nMany individuals have a period of changed eating behavior prior to full criteria for the\ndisorder being met. Some individuals with anorexia nervosa recover fully after a single\nepisode, with some exhibiting a fluctuating pattern of weight gain followed by relapse,\nand others experiencing a chronic course over many years. Hospitalization may be re-\nquired to restore weight and to address medical complications. Most individuals with an-\norexia nervosa experience remission within 5 years of presentation. Among individuals\nadmitted to hospitals, overall remission rates may be lower. The crude mortality rate (CMR)\nfor anorexia nervosa is approximately 5% per decade. Death most commonly results from\nmedical complications associated with the disorder itself or from suicide.", "risk_factors": "Temperamental.\nIndividuals who develop anxiety disorders or display obsessional\ntraits in childhood are at increased risk of developing anorexia nervosa.\nEnvironmental.\nHistorical and cross-cultural variability in the prevalence of anorexia\nnervosa supports its association with cultures and settings in which thinness is valued.

Concordance rates for anorexia nervosa in monozygotic\ntwins are significantly higher than those for dizygotic twins. A range of brain abnormali-\nties has been described in anorexia nervosa using functional imaging technologies (func-\ntional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography). The degree to which\nthese findings reflect changes associated with malnutrition versus primary abnormalities\nassociated with the disorder is unclear.", "cultural_issues": "Anorexia nervosa occurs across culturally and socially diverse populations, although available\nevidence suggests cross-cultural variation in its occurrence and presentation. Anorexia ner-\nvosa is probably most prevalent in post-industrialized, high-income countries such as in the\nUnited States, many European countries, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, but its incidence\nin most low- and middle-income countries is uncertain. Whereas the prevalence of anorexia\nnervosa appears comparatively low among Latinos, African Americans, and Asians in the\nUnited States, clinicians should be aware that mental health service utilization among individ-\nuals with an eating disorder is significantly lower in these ethnic groups and that the low rates\nmay reflect an ascertainment bias. The presentation of weight concerns among individuals\nwith eating and feeding disorders varies substantially across cultural contexts. The absence of\nan expressed intense fear of weight gain, sometimes referred to as “fat phobia,” appears to be\nrelatively more common in populations in Asia, where the rationale for dietary restriction is\ncommonly related to a more culturally sanctioned complaint such as gastrointestinal discom-\nfort. Within the United States, presentations without a stated intense fear of weight gain may\nbe comparatively more common among Latino groups.", "gender_issues": "", "diagnostic_markers": "The following laboratory abnormalities may be observed in anorexia nervosa; their pres-\nence may serve to increase diagnostic confidence.\nAnorexia Nervosa\n343\nHematology.\nLeukopenia is common, with the loss of all cell types but usually with ap-\nparent lymphocytosis. Mild anemia can occur, as well as thrombocytopenia and, rarely,\nbleeding problems.\nSerum chemistry.\nDehydration may be reflected by an elevated blood urea nitrogen\nlevel. Hypercholesterolemia is common. Hepatic enzyme levels may be elevated. Hypo-\nmagnesemia, hypozincemia, hypophosphatemia, and hyperamylasemia are occasionally\nobserved. Self-induced vomiting may lead to metabolic alkalosis (elevated serum bicarbon-\nate), hypochloremia, and hypokalemia; laxative abuse may cause a mild metabolic acidosis.\nEndocrine.\nSerum thyroxine (T4) levels are usually in the low-normal range; triiodothy-\nronine (T3) levels are decreased, while reverse T3 levels are elevated. Females have low se-\nrum estrogen levels, whereas males have low levels of serum testosterone.\nElectrocardiography.\nSinus bradycardia is common, and, rarely, arrhythmias are noted.\nSignificant prolongation of the QTc interval is observed in some individuals.\nBone mass.\nLow bone mineral density, with specific areas of osteopenia or osteoporo-\nsis, is often seen.

Amenorrhea is commonly present and appears to\nbe an indicator of physiological dysfunction. If present, amenorrhea is usually a conse-\nquence of the weight loss, but in a minority of individuals it may actually precede the\nweight loss. In prepubertal females, menarche may be delayed. In addition to amenorrhea,\nthere may be complaints of constipation, abdominal pain, cold intolerance, lethargy, and\nexcess energy.\nThe most remarkable finding on physical examination is emaciation. Commonly, there\nis also significant hypotension, hypothermia, and bradycardia. Some individuals develop\nlanugo, a fine downy body hair. Some develop peripheral edema, especially during\nweight restoration or upon cessation of laxative and diuretic abuse. Rarely, petechiae or\necchymoses, usually on the extremities, may indicate a bleeding diathesis. Some individ-\nuals evidence a yellowing of the skin associated with hypercarotenemia. As may be seen in\nindividuals with bulimia nervosa, individuals with anorexia nervosa who self-induce\nvomiting may have hypertrophy of the salivary glands, particularly the parotid glands, as\nwell as dental enamel erosion. Some individuals may have scars or calluses on the dorsal\nsurface of the hand from repeated contact with the teeth while inducing vomiting.", "suicide_risk": "Comprehensive evaluation of individuals with anorexia nervosa should include assess-\nment of suicide-related ideation and behaviors as well as other risk factors for suicide, in-\ncluding a history of suicide attempt(s).", "functional_consequences": "Individuals with anorexia nervosa may exhibit a range of functional limitations associated\nwith the disorder.

Acute\nweight loss associated with a medical condition can occasionally be followed by the onset\nor recurrence of anorexia nervosa, which can initially be masked by the comorbid medical\ncondition. Rarely, anorexia nervosa develops after bariatric surgery for obesity.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nIn major depressive disorder, severe weight loss may occur,\nbut most individuals with major depressive disorder do not have either a desire for exces-\nsive weight loss or an intense fear of gaining weight.\nSchizophrenia.\nIndividuals with schizophrenia may exhibit odd eating behavior and oc-\ncasionally experience significant weight loss, but they rarely show the fear of gaining\nweight and the body image disturbance required for a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa.\nSubstance use disorders.\nIndividuals with substance use disorders may experience low\nweight due to poor nutritional intake but generally do not fear gaining weight and do not\nmanifest body image disturbance. Individuals who abuse substances that reduce appetite\n(e.g., cocaine, stimulants) and who also endorse fear of weight gain should be carefully\nevaluated for the possibility of comorbid anorexia nervosa, given that the substance use\nmay represent a persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain (Criterion B).\nSocial anxiety disorder (social phobia), obsessive-compulsive disorder, and body dys-\nmorphic disorder.\nSome of the features of anorexia nervosa overlap with the criteria for\nsocial phobia, OCD, and body dysmorphic disorder. Specifically, individuals may feel hu-\nmiliated or embarrassed to be seen eating in public, as in social phobia; may exhibit obses-\nsions and compulsions related to food, as in OCD; or may be preoccupied with an imagined\ndefect in bodily appearance, as in body dysmorphic disorder. If the individual with anorexia\nnervosa has social fears that are limited to eating behavior alone, the diagnosis of social pho-\nbia should not be made, but social fears unrelated to eating behavior (e.g., excessive fear of\nspeaking in public) may warrant an additional diagnosis of social phobia. Similarly, an ad-\nditional diagnosis of OCD should be considered only if the individual exhibits obsessions\nand compulsions unrelated to food (e.g., an excessive fear of contamination), and an addi-\ntional diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder should be considered only if the distortion is\nunrelated to body shape and size (e.g., preoccupation that one’s nose is too big).\nBulimia nervosa.\nIndividuals with bulimia nervosa exhibit recurrent episodes of binge\neating, engage in inappropriate behavior to avoid weight gain (e.g., self-induced vomit-\ning), and are overly concerned with body shape and weight.

To qualify for the diagnosis, the binge eating and inappropriate compensa-\ntory behaviors must occur, on average, at least once per week for 3 months (Criterion C).\nAn “episode of binge eating” is defined as eating, in a discrete period of time, an\namount of food that is definitely larger than most individuals would eat in a similar period\nof time under similar circumstances (Criterion A1). The context in which the eating occurs\n346\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\nmay affect the clinician’s estimation of whether the intake is excessive. For example, a\nquantity of food that might be regarded as excessive for a typical meal might be consid-\nered normal during a celebration or holiday meal. A “discrete period of time” refers to a\nlimited period, usually less than 2 hours. A single episode of binge eating need not be re-\nstricted to one setting. For example, an individual may begin a binge in a restaurant and\nthen continue to eat on returning home. Continual snacking on small amounts of food\nthroughout the day would not be considered an eating binge.\nAn occurrence of excessive food consumption must be accompanied by a sense of lack\nof control (Criterion A2) to be considered an episode of binge eating. An indicator of loss\nof control is the inability to refrain from eating or to stop eating once started. Some indi-\nviduals describe a dissociative quality during, or following, the binge-eating episodes. The\nimpairment in control associated with binge eating may not be absolute; for example, an\nindividual may continue binge eating while the telephone is ringing but will cease if a\nroommate or spouse unexpectedly enters the room. Some individuals report that their\nbinge-eating episodes are no longer characterized by an acute feeling of loss of control but\nrather by a more generalized pattern of uncontrolled eating. If individuals report that they\nhave abandoned efforts to control their eating, loss of control should be considered as\npresent. Binge eating can also be planned in some instances.\nThe type of food consumed during binges varies both across individuals and for a\ngiven individual. Binge eating appears to be characterized more by an abnormality in the\namount of food consumed than by a craving for a specific nutrient. However, during binges,\nindividuals tend to eat foods they would otherwise avoid.\nIndividuals with bulimia nervosa are typically ashamed of their eating problems and\nattempt to conceal their symptoms. Binge eating usually occurs in secrecy or as inconspic-\nuously as possible. The binge eating often continues until the individual is uncomfortably,\nor even painfully, full. The most common antecedent of binge eating is negative affect.\nOther triggers include interpersonal stressors; dietary restraint; negative feelings related\nto body weight, body shape, and food; and boredom. Binge eating may minimize or mit-\nigate factors that precipitated the episode in the short-term, but negative self-evaluation\nand dysphoria often are the delayed consequences.\nAnother essential feature of bulimia nervosa is the recurrent use of inappropriate com-\npensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain, collectively referred to as purge behaviors or\npurging (Criterion B). Many individuals with bulimia nervosa employ several methods to\ncompensate for binge eating. Vomiting is the most common inappropriate compensatory\nbehavior. The immediate effects of vomiting include relief from physical discomfort and re-\nduction of fear of gaining weight. In some cases, vomiting becomes a goal in itself, and the\nindividual will binge eat in order to vomit or will vomit after eating a small amount of food.\nIndividuals with bulimia nervosa may use a variety of methods to induce vomiting, includ-\ning the use of fingers or instruments to stimulate the gag reflex. Individuals generally\nbecome adept at inducing vomiting and are eventually able to vomit at will. Rarely, indi-\nviduals consume syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting. Other purging behaviors include the\nmisuse of laxatives and diuretics. A number of other compensatory methods may also be\nused in rare cases. Individuals with bulimia nervosa may misuse enemas following epi-\nsodes of binge eating, but this is seldom the sole compensatory method employed. Individ-\nuals with this disorder may take thyroid hormone in an attempt to avoid weight gain.\nIndividuals with diabetes mellitus and bulimia nervosa may omit or reduce insulin doses in\norder to reduce the metabolism of food consumed during eating binges. Individuals with\nbulimia nervosa may fast for a day or more or exercise excessively in an attempt to prevent\nweight gain. Exercise may be considered excessive when it significantly interferes with im-\nportant activities, when it occurs at inappropriate times or in inappropriate settings, or\nwhen the individual continues to exercise despite injury or other medical complications.\nIndividuals with bulimia nervosa place an excessive emphasis on body shape or weight\nin their self-evaluation, and these factors are typically extremely important in determining\nBulimia Nervosa\n347\nself-esteem (Criterion D). Individuals with this disorder may closely resemble those with\nanorexia nervosa in their fear of gaining weight, in their desire to lose weight, and in the\nlevel of dissatisfaction with their bodies. However, a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa should\nnot be given when the disturbance occurs only during episodes of anorexia nervosa (Cri-\nterion E).", "associated_features": "Individuals with bulimia nervosa typically are within the normal weight or overweight\nrange (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 18.5 and < 30 in adults). The disorder occurs but is un-\ncommon among obese individuals. Between eating binges, individuals with bulimia ner-\nvosa typically restrict their total caloric consumption and preferentially select low-calorie\n(“diet”) foods while avoiding foods that they perceive to be fattening or likely to trigger a\nbinge.\nMenstrual irregularity or amenorrhea often occurs among females with bulimia ner-\nvosa; it is uncertain whether such disturbances are related to weight fluctuations, to nu-\ntritional deficiencies, or to emotional distress. The fluid and electrolyte disturbances\nresulting from the purging behavior are sometimes sufficiently severe to constitute med-\nically serious problems. Rare but potentially fatal complications include esophageal tears,\ngastric rupture, and cardiac arrhythmias. Serious cardiac and skeletal myopathies have\nbeen reported among individuals following repeated use of syrup of ipecac to induce vom-\niting. Individuals who chronically abuse laxatives may become dependent on their use to\nstimulate bowel movements. Gastrointestinal symptoms are commonly associated with\nbulimia nervosa, and rectal prolapse has also been reported among individuals with this\ndisorder.", "prevalence": "Twelve-month prevalence of bulimia nervosa among young females is 1%–1.5%. Pointand young adulthood. Less is known about the point prevalence of bulimia nervosa in\nmales, but bulimia nervosa is far less common in males than it is in females, with an ap-\nproximately 10:1 female-to-male ratio.", "development_course": "Bulimia nervosa commonly begins in adolescence or young adulthood. Onset before pu-\nberty or after age 40 is uncommon. The binge eating frequently begins during or after an\nepisode of dieting to lose weight. Experiencing multiple stressful life events also can pre-\ncipitate onset of bulimia nervosa.\nDisturbed eating behavior persists for at least several years in a high percentage of\nclinic samples. The course may be chronic or intermittent, with periods of remission\nalternating with recurrences of binge eating. However, over longer-term follow-up, the\nsymptoms of many individuals appear to diminish with or without treatment, although\ntreatment clearly impacts outcome. Periods of remission longer than 1 year are associated\nwith better long-term outcome.\nSignificantly elevated risk for mortality (all-cause and suicide) has been reported for\nindividuals with bulimia nervosa. The CMR (crude mortality rate) for bulimia nervosa is\nnearly 2% per decade.\nDiagnostic cross-over from initial bulimia nervosa to anorexia nervosa occurs in a mi-\nnority of cases (10%–15%). Individuals who do experience cross-over to anorexia nervosa\ncommonly will revert back to bulimia nervosa or have multiple occurrences of cross-overs\nbetween these disorders. A subset of individuals with bulimia nervosa continue to binge\neat but no longer engage in inappropriate compensatory behaviors, and therefore their\n348\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\nsymptoms meet criteria for binge-eating disorder or other specified eating disorder.

However, several labora-\ntory abnormalities may occur as a consequence of purging and may increase diagnostic\ncertainty. These include fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypokalemia (which\ncan provoke cardiac arrhythmias), hypochloremia, and hyponatremia. The loss of gastric\nacid through vomiting may produce a metabolic alkalosis (elevated serum bicarbonate),\nand the frequent induction of diarrhea or dehydration through laxative and diuretic abuse\ncan cause metabolic acidosis. Some individuals with bulimia nervosa exhibit mildly ele-\nvated levels of serum amylase, probably reflecting an increase in the salivary isoenzyme.\nPhysical examination usually yields no physical findings. However, inspection of the\nmouth may reveal significant and permanent loss of dental enamel, especially from lin-\ngual surfaces of the front teeth due to recurrent vomiting. These teeth may become\nchipped and appear ragged and “moth-eaten.” There may also be an increased frequency\nof dental caries. In some individuals, the salivary glands, particularly the parotid glands,\nmay become notably enlarged.

(Note: Do not use the additional code for Alzheimer’s disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) Diagnostic Features Beyond the neurocognitive disorder (NCD) syndrome (Criterion A), the core features of ma- jor or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease include an insidious onset and gradual pro- gression of cognitive and behavioral symptoms (Criterion B). The typical presentation is amnestic (i.e., with impairment in memory and learning). Unusual nonamnestic presen- tations, particularly visuospatial and logopenic aphasic variants, also exist. At the mild NCD phase, Alzheimer’s disease manifests typically with impairment in memory and learn- ing, sometimes accompanied by deficits in executive function. At the major NCD phase, visuoconstructional/perceptual-motor ability and language will also be impaired, partic- ularly when the NCD is moderate to severe. Social cognition tends to be preserved until late in the course of the disease. A level of diagnostic certainty must be specified denoting Alzheimer’s disease as the “probable” or “possible” etiology (Criterion C). Probable Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed in both major and mild NCD if there is evidence of a causative Alzheimer’s disease gene, ei- ther from genetic testing or from an autosomal dominant family history coupled with au- topsy confirmation or a genetic test in an affected family member. For major NCD, a typical clinical picture, without extended plateaus or evidence of mixed etiology, can also be diagnosed as due to probable Alzheimer’s disease. For mild NCD, given the lesser de- gree of certainty that the deficits will progress, these features are only sufficient for a possible Alzheimer’s etiology. If the etiology appears mixed, mild NCD due to multiple eti- ologies should be diagnosed. In any case, for both mild and major NCD due to Alzhei- mer’s disease, the clinical features must not suggest another primary etiology for the NCD (Criterion D). Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis In specialty clinical settings, approximately 80% of individuals with major NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease have behavioral and psychological manifestations; these features are also frequent at the mild NCD stage of impairment. These symptoms are as or more dis- tressing than cognitive manifestations and are frequently the reason that health care is sought. At the mild NCD stage or the mildest level of major NCD, depression and/or ap- athy are often seen. With moderately severe major NCD, psychotic features, irritability, agitation, combativeness, and wandering are common. Late in the illness, gait distur- bance, dysphagia, incontinence, myoclonus, and seizures are observed. Prevalence The prevalence of overall dementia (major NCD) rises steeply with age. In high-income countries, it ranges from 5% to 10% in the seventh decade to at least 25% thereafter. U.S. census data estimates suggest that approximately 7% of individuals diagnosed with Alz- heimer’s disease are between ages 65 and 74 years, 53% are between ages 75 and 84 years, and 40% are 85 years and older. The percentage of dementias attributable to Alzheimer’s disease ranges from about 60% to over 90%, depending on the setting and diagnostic cri- teria. Mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease is likely to represent a substantial fraction of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well. Development and Course Major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease progresses gradually, sometimes with brief plateaus, through severe dementia to death. The mean duration of survival after di- Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer’s Disease 613 agnosis is approximately 10 years, reflecting the advanced age of the majority of individ- uals rather than the course of the disease; some individuals can live with the disease for as long as 20 years. Late-stage individuals are eventually mute and bedbound. Death most commonly results from aspiration in those who survive through the full course. In mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease, impairments increase over time, and functional status gradually declines until symptoms reach the threshold for the diagnosis of major NCD. The onset of symptoms is usually in the eighth and ninth decades; early-onset forms seen in the fifth and sixth decades are often related to known causative mutations. Symp- toms and pathology do not differ markedly at different onset ages. However, younger in- dividuals are more likely to survive the full course of the disease, while older individuals are more likely to have numerous medical comorbidities that affect the course and man- agement of the illness. Diagnostic complexity is higher in older adults because of the in- creased likelihood of comorbid medical illness and mixed pathology. Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Traumatic brain injury increases risk for major or mild NCD due to Alz- heimer’s disease. Genetic and physiological. Age is the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. The genetic susceptibility polymorphism apolipoprotein E4 increases risk and decreases age at onset, particularly in homozygous individuals. There are also extremely rare causative Alzheimer’s disease genes. Individuals with Down’s syndrome (trisomy 21) develop Alz- heimer’s disease if they survive to midlife. Multiple vascular risk factors influence risk for Alzheimer’s disease and may act by increasing cerebrovascular pathology or also through direct effects on Alzheimer pathology. Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Detection of an NCD may be more difficult in cultural and socioeconomic settings where memory loss is considered normal in old age, where older adults face fewer cognitive de- mands in everyday life, or where very low educational levels pose greater challenges to objective cognitive assessment. Diagnostic Markers Cortical atrophy, amyloid-predominant neuritic plaques, and tau-predominant neurofibril- lary tangles are hallmarks of the pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and may be confirmed via postmortem histopathological examination. For early-onset cases with auto- somal dominant inheritance, a mutation in one of the known causative Alzheimer’s disease genes—amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), or presenilin 2 (PSEN2)— may be involved, and genetic testing for such mutations is commercially available, at least for PSEN1. Apolipoprotein E4 cannot serve as a diagnostic marker because it is only a risk factor and neither necessary nor sufficient for disease occurrence. Since amyloid beta-42 deposition in the brain occurs early in the pathophysiological cascade, amyloid-based diagnostic tests such as amyloid imaging on brain positron emis- sion tomography (PET) scans and reduced levels of amyloid beta-42 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may have diagnostic value. Signs of neuronal injury, such as hippocampal and temporoparietal cortical atrophy on a magnetic resonance image scan, temporoparietal hypometabolism on a fluorodeoxyglucose PET scan, and evidence for elevated total tau and phospho-tau levels in CSF, provide evidence of neuronal damage but are less specific for Alzheimer’s disease. At present, these biomarkers are not fully validated, and many are available only in tertiary care settings. However, some of them, along with novel bio- markers, will likely move into wider clinical practice in the coming years. 614 Neurocognitive Disorders Functional Consequences of Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer’s Disease The prominence of memory loss can cause significant difficulties relatively early in the course. Social cognition (and thus social functioning) and procedural memory (e.g., danc- ing, playing musical instruments) may be relatively preserved for extended periods. Differential Diagnosis Other neurocognitive disorders. Major and mild NCDs due to other neurodegenera- tive processes (e.g., Lewy body disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration) share the in- sidious onset and gradual decline caused by Alzheimer’s disease but have distinctive core features of their own. In major or mild vascular NCD, there is typically history of stroke temporally related to the onset of cognitive impairment, and infarcts or white matter hy- perintensities are judged sufficient to account for the clinical picture. However, particu- larly when there is no clear history of stepwise decline, major or mild vascular NCD can share many clinical features with Alzheimer’s disease. Other concurrent, active neurological or systemic illness. Other neurological or sys- temic illness should be considered if there is an appropriate temporal relationship and severity to account for the clinical picture. At the mild NCD level, it may be difficult to dis- tinguish an Alzheimer’s disease etiology from that of another medical condition (e.g., thy- roid disorders, vitamin B12 deficiency). Major depressive disorder. Particularly at the mild NCD level, the differential diagnosis also includes major depression. The presence of depression may be associated with re- duced daily functioning and poor concentration that may resemble an NCD, but improve- ment with treatment of depression may be useful in making the distinction. Comorbidity Most individuals with Alzheimer’s disease are elderly and have multiple medical conditions that can complicate diagnosis and influence the clinical course. Major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease commonly co-occurs with cerebrovascular disease, which contributes to the clinical picture. When a comorbid condition contributes to the NCD in an individual with Alzheimer’s disease, then NCD due to multiple etiologies should be diagnosed.", "subtypes": "", "specifiers": "", "recording_procedures": "", "diagnostic_features": "", "associated_features": "", "prevalence": "", "development_course": "", "risk_factors": "", "cultural_issues": "", "gender_issues": "", "diagnostic_markers": "", "suicide_risk": "", "functional_consequences": "", "differential_diagnosis": "", "comorbidity": ""}, "provenance": {"source_file": "neurocognitive_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 7, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.470385"}}

Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, ranging,\nfor example, from poorly integrated verbal and nonverbal communication; to abnor-\nmalities in eye contact and body language or deficits in understanding and use of\ngestures; to a total lack of facial expressions and nonverbal communication.\n3.

Severity of social communication difficulties and re-\nstricted, repetitive behaviors should be separately rated. The descriptive severity categories\nshould not be used to determine eligibility for and provision of services; these can only be\ndeveloped at an individual level and through discussion of personal priorities and targets.\nRegarding the specifier “with or without accompanying intellectual impairment,” un-\nderstanding the (often uneven) intellectual profile of a child or adult with autism spectrum\ndisorder is necessary for interpreting diagnostic features. Separate estimates of verbal and\nnonverbal skill are necessary (e.g., using untimed nonverbal tests to assess potential\nstrengths in individuals with limited language).\n52\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nTABLE 2 Severity levels for autism spectrum disorder\nSeverity level\nSocial communication\nRestricted, repetitive behaviors\nLevel 3\n“Requiring very substantial support”\nSevere deficits in verbal and nonverbal social com-\nmunication skills cause severe impairments in func-\ntioning, very limited initiation of social\ninteractions, and minimal response to social over-\ntures from others. For example, a person with few\nwords of intelligible speech who rarely initiates\ninteraction and, when he or she does, makes\nunusual approaches to meet needs only and\nresponds to only very direct social approaches.\nInflexibility of behavior, extreme difficulty coping\nwith change, or other restricted/repetitive behav-\niors markedly interfere with functioning in all\nspheres. Great distress/difficulty changing focus\nor action.\nLevel 2\n“Requiring substantial support”\nMarked deficits in verbal and nonverbal social com-\nmunication skills; social impairments apparent\neven with supports in place; limited initiation of\nsocial interactions; and reduced or abnormal\nresponses to social overtures from others. For\nexample, a person who speaks simple sentences,\nwhose interaction is limited to narrow special inter-\nests, and who has markedly odd nonverbal com-\nmunication.\nInflexibility of behavior, difficulty coping with\nchange, or other restricted/repetitive behaviors\nappear frequently enough to be obvious to the\ncasual observer and interfere with functioning\nin a variety of contexts. Distress and/or difficulty\nchanging focus or action.\nLevel 1\n“Requiring support”\nWithout supports in place, deficits in social communi-\ncation cause noticeable impairments.\nDifficulty initiating social interactions, and clear\nexamples of atypical or unsuccessful responses to\nsocial overtures of others. May appear to have\ndecreased interest in social interactions. For example,\na person who is able to speak in full sentences and\nengages in communication but whose to-and-fro con-\nversation with others fails, and whose attempts to\nmake friends are odd and typically unsuccessful.\nInflexibility of behavior causes significant interfer-\nence with functioning in one or more contexts. Dif-\nficulty switching between activities. Problems of\norganization and planning hamper independence.\nAutism Spectrum Disorder\n53\nTo use the specifier “with or without accompanying language impairment,” the cur-\nrent level of verbal functioning should be assessed and described. Examples of the specific\ndescriptions for “with accompanying language impairment” might include no intelligible\nspeech (nonverbal), single words only, or phrase speech. Language level in individuals\n“without accompanying language impairment” might be further described by speaks in\nfull sentences or has fluent speech. Since receptive language may lag behind expressive\nlanguage development in autism spectrum disorder, receptive and expressive language\nskills should be considered separately.\nThe specifier “associated with a known medical or genetic condition or environmental fac-\ntor” should be used when the individual has a known genetic disorder (e.g., Rett syndrome,\nFragile X syndrome, Down syndrome), a medical disorder (e.g. epilepsy), or a history of envi-\nronmental exposure (e.g., valproate, fetal alcohol syndrome, very low birth weight).\nAdditional neurodevelopmental, mental or behavioral conditions should also be noted\n(e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; developmental coordination disorder; dis-\nruptive behavior, impulse-control, or conduct disorders; anxiety, depressive, or bipolar\ndisorders; tics or Tourette’s disorder; self-injury; feeding, elimination, or sleep disorders).", "recording_procedures": "For autism spectrum disorder that is associated with a known medical or genetic condition\nor environmental factor, or with another neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral dis-\norder, record autism spectrum disorder associated with (name of condition, disorder, or\nfactor) (e.g., autism spectrum disorder associated with Rett syndrome). Severity should be\nrecorded as level of support needed for each of the two psychopathological domains in\nTable 2 (e.g., “requiring very substantial support for deficits in social communication and\nrequiring substantial support for restricted, repetitive behaviors”). Specification of “with\naccompanying intellectual impairment” or “without accompanying intellectual impair-\nment” should be recorded next. Language impairment specification should be recorded\nthereafter. If there is accompanying language impairment, the current level of verbal func-\ntioning should be recorded (e.g., “with accompanying language impairment—no intelligi-\nble speech” or “with accompanying language impairment—phrase speech”). If catatonia is\npresent, record separately “catatonia associated with autism spectrum disorder.”", "diagnostic_features": "The essential features of autism spectrum disorder are persistent impairment in reciprocal\nsocial communication and social interaction (Criterion A), and restricted, repetitive pat-\nterns of behavior, interests, or activities (Criterion B). These symptoms are present from\nearly childhood and limit or impair everyday functioning (Criteria C and D). The stage at\nwhich functional impairment becomes obvious will vary according to characteristics of\nthe individual and his or her environment. Core diagnostic features are evident in the\ndevelopmental period, but intervention, compensation, and current supports may mask\ndifficulties in at least some contexts. Manifestations of the disorder also vary greatly de-\npending on the severity of the autistic condition, developmental level, and chronological age;\nhence, the term spectrum. Autism spectrum disorder encompasses disorders previously re-\nferred to as early infantile autism, childhood autism, Kanner’s autism, high-functioning\nautism, atypical autism, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, child-\nhood disintegrative disorder, and Asperger’s disorder.\nThe impairments in communication and social interaction specified in Criterion A are\npervasive and sustained. Diagnoses are most valid and reliable when based on multiple\nsources of information, including clinician’s observations, caregiver history, and, when\npossible, self-report. Verbal and nonverbal deficits in social communication have varying\nmanifestations, depending on the individual’s age, intellectual level, and language ability,\nas well as other factors such as treatment history and current support. Many individuals\nhave language deficits, ranging from complete lack of speech through language delays,\npoor comprehension of speech, echoed speech, or stilted and overly literal language. Even\nwhen formal language skills (e.g., vocabulary, grammar) are intact, the use of language for\nreciprocal social communication is impaired in autism spectrum disorder.\nDeficits in social-emotional reciprocity (i.e., the ability to engage with others and share\nthoughts and feelings) are clearly evident in young children with the disorder, who may\nshow little or no initiation of social interaction and no sharing of emotions, along with re-\nduced or absent imitation of others’ behavior. What language exists is often one-sided,\nlacking in social reciprocity, and used to request or label rather than to comment, share\nfeelings, or converse. In adults without intellectual disabilities or language delays, deficits\nin social-emotional reciprocity may be most apparent in difficulties processing and re-\nsponding to complex social cues (e.g., when and how to join a conversation, what not to\nsay). Adults who have developed compensation strategies for some social challenges still\nstruggle in novel or unsupported situations and suffer from the effort and anxiety of con-\nsciously calculating what is socially intuitive for most individuals.\n54\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nDeficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction are mani-\nfested by absent, reduced, or atypical use of eye contact (relative to cultural norms), ges-\ntures, facial expressions, body orientation, or speech intonation. An early feature of autism\nspectrum disorder is impaired joint attention as manifested by a lack of pointing, showing,\nor bringing objects to share interest with others, or failure to follow someone’s pointing or\neye gaze. Individuals may learn a few functional gestures, but their repertoire is smaller\nthan that of others, and they often fail to use expressive gestures spontaneously in com-\nmunication. Among adults with fluent language, the difficulty in coordinating nonverbal\ncommunication with speech may give the impression of odd, wooden, or exaggerated\n“body language” during interactions. Impairment may be relatively subtle within indi-\nvidual modes (e.g., someone may have relatively good eye contact when speaking) but\nnoticeable in poor integration of eye contact, gesture, body posture, prosody, and facial ex-\npression for social communication.\nDeficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships should be\njudged against norms for age, gender, and culture. There may be absent, reduced, or atyp-\nical social interest, manifested by rejection of others, passivity, or inappropriate ap-\nproaches that seem aggressive or disruptive. These difficulties are particularly evident in\nyoung children, in whom there is often a lack of shared social play and imagination (e.g.,\nage-appropriate flexible pretend play) and, later, insistence on playing by very fixed rules.\nOlder individuals may struggle to understand what behavior is considered appropriate in\none situation but not another (e.g., casual behavior during a job interview), or the different\nways that language may be used to communicate (e.g., irony, white lies). There may be an\napparent preference for solitary activities or for interacting with much younger or older\npeople. Frequently, there is a desire to establish friendships without a complete or realistic\nidea of what friendship entails (e.g., one-sided friendships or friendships based solely on\nshared special interests). Relationships with siblings, co-workers, and caregivers are also\nimportant to consider (in terms of reciprocity).\nAutism spectrum disorder is also defined by restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior,\ninterests, or activities (as specified in Criterion B), which show a range of manifestations\naccording to age and ability, intervention, and current supports. Stereotyped or repetitive\nbehaviors include simple motor stereotypies (e.g., hand flapping, finger flicking), repeti-\ntive use of objects (e.g., spinning coins, lining up toys), and repetitive speech (e.g., echola-\nlia, the delayed or immediate parroting of heard words; use of “you” when referring to\nself; stereotyped use of words, phrases, or prosodic patterns). Excessive adherence to rou-\ntines and restricted patterns of behavior may be manifest in resistance to change (e.g., dis-\ntress at apparently small changes, such as in packaging of a favorite food; insistence on\nadherence to rules; rigidity of thinking) or ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal be-\nhavior (e.g., repetitive questioning, pacing a perimeter). Highly restricted, fixated interests\nin autism spectrum disorder tend to be abnormal in intensity or focus (e.g., a toddler\nstrongly attached to a pan; a child preoccupied with vacuum cleaners; an adult spending\nhours writing out timetables). Some fascinations and routines may relate to apparent hy-\nper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input, manifested through extreme responses to specific\nsounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, fascination with lights or\nspinning objects, and sometimes apparent indifference to pain, heat, or cold. Extreme re-\naction to or rituals involving taste, smell, texture, or appearance of food or excessive food\nrestrictions are common and may be a presenting feature of autism spectrum disorder.\nMany adults with autism spectrum disorder without intellectual or language disabili-\nties learn to suppress repetitive behavior in public. Special interests may be a source of\npleasure and motivation and provide avenues for education and employment later in life.", "associated_features": "Many individuals with autism spectrum disorder also have intellectual impairment and/or\nlanguage impairment (e.g., slow to talk, language comprehension behind production). Even\nthose with average or high intelligence have an uneven profile of abilities. The gap between\nintellectual and adaptive functional skills is often large. Motor deficits are often present, in-\ncluding odd gait, clumsiness, and other abnormal motor signs (e.g., walking on tiptoes). Self-\ninjury (e.g., head banging, biting the wrist) may occur, and disruptive/challenging behav-\niors are more common in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder than\nother disorders, including intellectual disability. Adolescents and adults with autism spec-\ntrum disorder are prone to anxiety and depression. Some individuals develop catatonic-like\nmotor behavior (slowing and “freezing” mid-action), but these are typically not of the mag-\nnitude of a catatonic episode. However, it is possible for individuals with autism spectrum\ndisorder to experience a marked deterioration in motor symptoms and display a full cata-\ntonic episode with symptoms such as mutism, posturing, grimacing and waxy flexibility.\nThe risk period for comorbid catatonia appears to be greatest in the adolescent years.", "prevalence": "In recent years, reported frequencies for autism spectrum disorder across U.S. and non-\nU.S. countries have approached 1% of the population, with similar estimates in child and\nadult samples. It remains unclear whether higher rates reflect an expansion of the diag-\nnostic criteria of DSM-IV to include subthreshold cases, increased awareness, differences\nin study methodology, or a true increase in the frequency of autism spectrum disorder.", "development_course": "The age and pattern of onset also should be noted for autism spectrum disorder. Symptoms\nare typically recognized during the second year of life (12–24 months of age) but may be seen\nearlier than 12 months if developmental delays are severe, or noted later than 24 months if\nsymptoms are more subtle. The pattern of onset description might include information\nabout early developmental delays or any losses of social or language skills. In cases where\nskills have been lost, parents or caregivers may give a history of a gradual or relatively\nrapid deterioration in social behaviors or language skills. Typically, this would occur be-\ntween 12 and 24 months of age and is distinguished from the rare instances of developmen-\ntal regression occurring after at least 2 years of normal development (previously described\nas childhood disintegrative disorder).\nThe behavioral features of autism spectrum disorder first become evident in early\nchildhood, with some cases presenting a lack of interest in social interaction in the first\nyear of life. Some children with autism spectrum disorder experience developmental pla-\nteaus or regression, with a gradual or relatively rapid deterioration in social behaviors or\nuse of language, often during the first 2 years of life. Such losses are rare in other disor-\nders and may be a useful “red flag” for autism spectrum disorder. Much more unusual\nand warranting more extensive medical investigation are losses of skills beyond social\ncommunication (e.g., loss of self-care, toileting, motor skills) or those occurring after the\n56\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nsecond birthday (see also Rett syndrome in the section “Differential Diagnosis” for this\ndisorder).\nFirst symptoms of autism spectrum disorder frequently involve delayed language de-\nvelopment, often accompanied by lack of social interest or unusual social interactions (e.g.,\npulling individuals by the hand without any attempt to look at them), odd play patterns\n(e.g., carrying toys around but never playing with them), and unusual communication\npatterns (e.g., knowing the alphabet but not responding to own name). Deafness may be\nsuspected but is typically ruled out. During the second year, odd and repetitive behaviors\nand the absence of typical play become more apparent. Since many typically developing\nyoung children have strong preferences and enjoy repetition (e.g., eating the same foods,\nwatching the same video multiple times), distinguishing restricted and repetitive behav-\niors that are diagnostic of autism spectrum disorder can be difficult in preschoolers. The\nclinical distinction is based on the type, frequency, and intensity of the behavior (e.g., a\nchild who daily lines up objects for hours and is very distressed if any item is moved).\nAutism spectrum disorder is not a degenerative disorder, and it is typical for learning\nand compensation to continue throughout life. Symptoms are often most marked in early\nchildhood and early school years, with developmental gains typical in later childhood in\nat least some areas (e.g., increased interest in social interaction). A small proportion of in-\ndividuals deteriorate behaviorally during adolescence, whereas most others improve.\nOnly a minority of individuals with autism spectrum disorder live and work indepen-\ndently in adulthood; those who do tend to have superior language and intellectual abilities\nand are able to find a niche that matches their special interests and skills. In general, indi-\nviduals with lower levels of impairment may be better able to function independently.\nHowever, even these individuals may remain socially naive and vulnerable, have difficul-\nties organizing practical demands without aid, and are prone to anxiety and depression.\nMany adults report using compensation strategies and coping mechanisms to mask their\ndifficulties in public but suffer from the stress and effort of maintaining a socially accept-\nable facade. Scarcely anything is known about old age in autism spectrum disorder.\nSome individuals come for first diagnosis in adulthood, perhaps prompted by the diagno-\nsis of autism in a child in the family or a breakdown of relations at work or home. Obtaining de-\ntailed developmental history in such cases may be difficult, and it is important to consider self-\nreported difficulties. Where clinical observation suggests criteria are currently met, autism\nspectrum disorder may be diagnosed, provided there is no evidence of good social and com-\nmunication skills in childhood. For example, the report (by parents or another relative) that the\nindividual had ordinary and sustained reciprocal friendships and good nonverbal communi-\ncation skills throughout childhood would rule out a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder;\nhowever, the absence of developmental information in itself should not do so.\nManifestations of the social and communication impairments and restricted/repeti-\ntive behaviors that define autism spectrum disorder are clear in the developmental period.\nIn later life, intervention or compensation, as well as current supports, may mask these dif-\nficulties in at least some contexts. However, symptoms remain sufficient to cause current\nimpairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.", "risk_factors": "The best established prognostic factors for individual outcome within autism spectrum\ndisorder are presence or absence of associated intellectual disability and language impair-\nment (e.g., functional language by age 5 years is a good prognostic sign) and additional\nmental health problems. Epilepsy, as a comorbid diagnosis, is associated with greater in-\ntellectual disability and lower verbal ability.\nEnvironmental.\nA variety of nonspecific risk factors, such as advanced parental age, low\nbirth weight, or fetal exposure to valproate, may contribute to risk of autism spectrum dis-\norder.\nAutism Spectrum Disorder\n57\nGenetic and physiological.\nHeritability estimates for autism spectrum disorder have\nranged from 37% to higher than 90%, based on twin concordance rates. Currently, as many\nas 15% of cases of autism spectrum disorder appear to be associated with a known genetic\nmutation, with different de novo copy number variants or de novo mutations in specific\ngenes associated with the disorder in different families. However, even when an autism\nspectrum disorder is associated with a known genetic mutation, it does not appear to be\nfully penetrant. Risk for the remainder of cases appears to be polygenic, with perhaps hun-\ndreds of genetic loci making relatively small contributions.", "cultural_issues": "Cultural differences will exist in norms for social interaction, nonverbal communication,\nand relationships, but individuals with autism spectrum disorder are markedly impaired\nagainst the norms for their cultural context. Cultural and socioeconomic factors may affect\nage at recognition or diagnosis; for example, in the United States, late or underdiagnosis of\nautism spectrum disorder among African American children may occur.", "gender_issues": "Autism spectrum disorder is diagnosed four times more often in males than in females. In\nclinic samples, females tend to be more likely to show accompanying intellectual disabil-\nity, suggesting that girls without accompanying intellectual impairments or language\ndelays may go unrecognized, perhaps because of subtler manifestation of social and com-\nmunication difficulties.", "diagnostic_markers": "", "suicide_risk": "", "functional_consequences": "In young children with autism spectrum disorder, lack of social and communication abil-\nities may hamper learning, especially learning through social interaction or in settings\nwith peers. In the home, insistence on routines and aversion to change, as well as sensory\nsensitivities, may interfere with eating and sleeping and make routine care (e.g., haircuts,\ndental work) extremely difficult. Adaptive skills are typically below measured IQ. Ex-\ntreme difficulties in planning, organization, and coping with change negatively impact\nacademic achievement, even for students with above-average intelligence. During adult-\nhood, these individuals may have difficulties establishing independence because of con-\ntinued rigidity and difficulty with novelty.\nMany individuals with autism spectrum disorder, even without intellectual disability,\nhave poor adult psychosocial functioning as indexed by measures such as independent\nliving and gainful employment. Functional consequences in old age are unknown, but so-\ncial isolation and communication problems (e.g., reduced help-seeking) are likely to have\nconsequences for health in older adulthood.", "differential_diagnosis": "Rett syndrome.\nDisruption of social interaction may be observed during the regressive\nphase of Rett syndrome (typically between 1–4 years of age); thus, a substantial proportion\nof affected young girls may have a presentation that meets diagnostic criteria for autism\nspectrum disorder. However, after this period, most individuals with Rett syndrome im-\nprove their social communication skills, and autistic features are no longer a major area of\nconcern. Consequently, autism spectrum disorder should be considered only when all di-\nagnostic criteria are met.\nSelective mutism.\nIn selective mutism, early development is not typically disturbed.\nThe affected child usually exhibits appropriate communication skills in certain contexts\nand settings. Even in settings where the child is mute, social reciprocity is not impaired,\nnor are restricted or repetitive patterns of behavior present.\n58\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nLanguage disorders and social (pragmatic) communication disorder.\nIn some forms\nof language disorder, there may be problems of communication and some secondary so-\ncial difficulties. However, specific language disorder is not usually associated with abnor-\nmal nonverbal communication, nor with the presence of restricted, repetitive patterns of\nbehavior, interests, or activities.\nWhen an individual shows impairment in social communication and social interactions\nbut does not show restricted and repetitive behavior or interests, criteria for social (prag-\nmatic) communication disorder, instead of autism spectrum disorder, may be met. The di-\nagnosis of autism spectrum disorder supersedes that of social (pragmatic) communication\ndisorder whenever the criteria for autism spectrum disorder are met, and care should be\ntaken to enquire carefully regarding past or current restricted/repetitive behavior.\nIntellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) without autism spectrum\ndisorder.\nIntellectual disability without autism spectrum disorder may be difficult to\ndifferentiate from autism spectrum disorder in very young children. Individuals with in-\ntellectual disability who have not developed language or symbolic skills also present a\nchallenge for differential diagnosis, since repetitive behavior often occurs in such individ-\nuals as well. A diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in an individual with intellectual\ndisability is appropriate when social communication and interaction are significantly im-\npaired relative to the developmental level of the individual’s nonverbal skills (e.g., fine\nmotor skills, nonverbal problem solving). In contrast, intellectual disability is the appropri-\nate diagnosis when there is no apparent discrepancy between the level of social-commu-\nnicative skills and other intellectual skills.\nStereotypic movement disorder.\nMotor stereotypies are among the diagnostic charac-\nteristics of autism spectrum disorder, so an additional diagnosis of stereotypic movement\ndisorder is not given when such repetitive behaviors are better explained by the presence\nof autism spectrum disorder. However, when stereotypies cause self-injury and become a\nfocus of treatment, both diagnoses may be appropriate.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nAbnormalities of attention (overly focused or\neasily distracted) are common in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, as is hy-\nperactivity. A diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) should be\nconsidered when attentional difficulties or hyperactivity exceeds that typically seen in in-\ndividuals of comparable mental age.\nSchizophrenia.\nSchizophrenia with childhood onset usually develops after a period of\nnormal, or near normal, development. A prodromal state has been described in which so-\ncial impairment and atypical interests and beliefs occur, which could be confused with the\nsocial deficits seen in autism spectrum disorder. Hallucinations and delusions, which are\ndefining features of schizophrenia, are not features of autism spectrum disorder. How-\never, clinicians must take into account the potential for individuals with autism spectrum\ndisorder to be concrete in their interpretation of questions regarding the key features of\nschizophrenia (e.g., “Do you hear voices when no one is there?” ”Yes [on the radio]”).", "comorbidity": "Autism spectrum disorder is frequently associated with intellectual impairment and struc-\ntural language disorder (i.e., an inability to comprehend and construct sentences with proper\ngrammar), which should be noted under the relevant specifiers when applicable. Many in-\ndividuals with autism spectrum disorder have psychiatric symptoms that do not form part of\nthe diagnostic criteria for the disorder (about 70% of individuals with autism spectrum dis-\norder may have one comorbid mental disorder, and 40% may have two or more comorbid\nmental disorders). When criteria for both ADHD and autism spectrum disorder are met, both\ndiagnoses should be given. This same principle applies to concurrent diagnoses of autism\nspectrum disorder and developmental coordination disorder, anxiety disorders, depressive\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder\n59\ndisorders, and other comorbid diagnoses. Among individuals who are nonverbal or have\nlanguage deficits, observable signs such as changes in sleep or eating and increases in chal-\nlenging behavior should trigger an evaluation for anxiety or depression. Specific learning dif-\nficulties (literacy and numeracy) are common, as is developmental coordination disorder.\nMedical conditions commonly associated with autism spectrum disorder should be noted\nunder the “associated with a known medical/genetic or environmental/acquired condition”\nspecifier. Such medical conditions include epilepsy, sleep problems, and constipation.\nAvoidant-restrictive food intake disorder is a fairly frequent presenting feature of autism\nspectrum disorder, and extreme and narrow food preferences may persist.\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity\nDisorder"}, "provenance": {"source_file": "neurodevelopmental_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 9, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.483383"}}

Inattention manifests behaviorally in ADHD as wandering off task, lacking\npersistence, having difficulty sustaining focus, and being disorganized and is not due to\ndefiance or lack of comprehension. Hyperactivity refers to excessive motor activity (such as\na child running about) when it is not appropriate, or excessive fidgeting, tapping, or talk-\nativeness. In adults, hyperactivity may manifest as extreme restlessness or wearing others\nout with their activity. Impulsivity refers to hasty actions that occur in the moment without\nforethought and that have high potential for harm to the individual (e.g., darting into the\nstreet without looking). Impulsivity may reflect a desire for immediate rewards or an in-\nability to delay gratification. Impulsive behaviors may manifest as social intrusiveness\n(e.g., interrupting others excessively) and/or as making important decisions without con-\nsideration of long-term consequences (e.g., taking a job without adequate information).\nADHD begins in childhood. The requirement that several symptoms be present before\nage 12 years conveys the importance of a substantial clinical presentation during child-\nhood. At the same time, an earlier age at onset is not specified because of difficulties in es-\ntablishing precise childhood onset retrospectively. Adult recall of childhood symptoms\ntends to be unreliable, and it is beneficial to obtain ancillary information.\nManifestations of the disorder must be present in more than one setting (e.g., home and\nschool, work). Confirmation of substantial symptoms across settings typically cannot be\ndone accurately without consulting informants who have seen the individual in those set-\ntings. Typically, symptoms vary depending on context within a given setting. Signs of the\ndisorder may be minimal or absent when the individual is receiving frequent rewards for\nappropriate behavior, is under close supervision, is in a novel setting, is engaged in espe-\ncially interesting activities, has consistent external stimulation (e.g., via electronic screens),\nor is interacting in one-on-one situations (e.g., the clinician's office).", "associated_features": "Mild delays in language, motor, or social development are not specific to ADHD but often co-\noccur. Associated features may include low frustration tolerance, irritability, or mood lability.\nEven in the absence of a specific learning disorder, academic or work performance is often im-\npaired. Inattentive behavior is associated with various underlying cognitive processes, and in-\ndividuals with ADHD may exhibit cognitive problems on tests of attention, executive\nfunction, or memory, although these tests are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to serve as di-\nagnostic indices. By early adulthood, ADHD is associated with an increased risk of suicide at-\ntempt, primarily when comorbid with mood, conduct, or substance use disorders.\nNo biological marker is diagnostic for ADHD. As a group, compared with peers, chil-\ndren with ADHD display increased slow wave electroencephalograms, reduced total\nbrain volume on magnetic resonance imaging, and possibly a delay in posterior to anterior\ncortical maturation, but these findings are not diagnostic. In the uncommon cases where\nthere is a known genetic cause (e.g., Fragile X syndrome, 22q11 deletion syndrome), the\nADHD presentation should still be diagnosed.", "prevalence": "Population surveys suggest that ADHD occurs in most cultures in about 5% of children\nand about 2.5% of adults.\n62\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders", "development_course": "Many parents first observe excessive motor activity when the child is a toddler, but symp-\ntoms are difficult to distinguish from highly variable normative behaviors before age 4\nyears. ADHD is most often identified during elementary school years, and inattention be-\ncomes more prominent and impairing. The disorder is relatively stable through early ad-\nolescence, but some individuals have a worsened course with development of antisocial\nbehaviors. In most individuals with ADHD, symptoms of motoric hyperactivity become\nless obvious in adolescence and adulthood, but difficulties with restlessness, inattention,\npoor planning, and impulsivity persist. A substantial proportion of children with ADHD\nremain relatively impaired into adulthood.\nIn preschool, the main manifestation is hyperactivity. Inattention becomes more prom-\ninent during elementary school. During adolescence, signs of hyperactivity (e.g., running\nand climbing) are less common and may be confined to fidgetiness or an inner feeling of\njitteriness, restlessness, or impatience. In adulthood, along with inattention and restless-\nness, impulsivity may remain problematic even when hyperactivity has diminished.", "risk_factors": "Temperamental.\nADHD is associated with reduced behavioral inhibition, effortful con-\ntrol, or constraint; negative emotionality; and/or elevated novelty seeking. These traits\nmay predispose some children to ADHD but are not specific to the disorder.\nEnvironmental.\nVery low birth weight (less than 1,500 grams) conveys a two- to three-\nfold risk for ADHD, but most children with low birth weight do not develop ADHD. Al-\nthough ADHD is correlated with smoking during pregnancy, some of this association\nreflects common genetic risk. A minority of cases may be related to reactions to aspects of\ndiet. There may be a history of child abuse, neglect, multiple foster placements, neurotoxin\nexposure (e.g., lead), infections (e.g., encephalitis), or alcohol exposure in utero. Exposure\nto environmental toxicants has been correlated with subsequent ADHD, but it is not\nknown whether these associations are causal.\nGenetic and physiological.\nADHD is elevated in the first-degree biological relatives of\nindividuals with ADHD. The heritability of ADHD is substantial. While specific genes\nhave been correlated with ADHD, they are neither necessary nor sufficient causal factors.\nVisual and hearing impairments, metabolic abnormalities, sleep disorders, nutritional de-\nficiencies, and epilepsy should be considered as possible influences on ADHD symptoms.\nADHD is not associated with specific physical features, although rates of minor phys-\nical anomalies (e.g., hypertelorism, highly arched palate, low-set ears) may be relatively\nelevated. Subtle motor delays and other neurological soft signs may occur. (Note that\nmarked co-occurring clumsiness and motor delays should be coded separately [e.g., de-\nvelopmental coordination disorder].)\nCourse modifiers.\nFamily interaction patterns in early childhood are unlikely to cause\nADHD but may influence its course or contribute to secondary development of conduct\nproblems.", "cultural_issues": "Differences in ADHD prevalence rates across regions appear attributable mainly to differ-\nent diagnostic and methodological practices. However, there also may be cultural varia-\ntion in attitudes toward or interpretations of children’s behaviors. Clinical identification\nrates in the United States for African American and Latino populations tend to be lower\nthan for Caucasian populations.

Females are more likely than males to\npresent primarily with inattentive features.", "diagnostic_markers": "", "suicide_risk": "", "functional_consequences": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder\nADHD is associated with reduced school performance and academic attainment, social re-\njection, and, in adults, poorer occupational performance, attainment, attendance, and\nhigher probability of unemployment as well as elevated interpersonal conflict. Children\nwith ADHD are significantly more likely than their peers without ADHD to develop con-\nduct disorder in adolescence and antisocial personality disorder in adulthood, conse-\nquently increasing the likelihood for substance use disorders and incarceration. The risk of\nsubsequent substance use disorders is elevated, especially when conduct disorder or an-\ntisocial personality disorder develops. Individuals with ADHD are more likely than peers\nto be injured. Traffic accidents and violations are more frequent in drivers with ADHD.\nThere may be an elevated likelihood of obesity among individuals with ADHD.\nInadequate or variable self-application to tasks that require sustained effort is often in-\nterpreted by others as laziness, irresponsibility, or failure to cooperate. Family relation-\nships may be characterized by discord and negative interactions. Peer relationships are\noften disrupted by peer rejection, neglect, or teasing of the individual with ADHD. On av-\nerage, individuals with ADHD obtain less schooling, have poorer vocational achievement,\nand have reduced intellectual scores than their peers, although there is great variability. In\nits severe form, the disorder is markedly impairing, affecting social, familial, and scholas-\ntic/occupational adjustment.\nAcademic deficits, school-related problems, and peer neglect tend to be most associ-\nated with elevated symptoms of inattention, whereas peer rejection and, to a lesser extent,\naccidental injury are most salient with marked symptoms of hyperactivity or impulsivity.", "differential_diagnosis": "Oppositional defiant disorder.\nIndividuals with oppositional defiant disorder may re-\nsist work or school tasks that require self-application because they resist conforming to\nothers' demands. Their behavior is characterized by negativity, hostility, and defiance.\nThese symptoms must be differentiated from aversion to school or mentally demanding\ntasks due to difficulty in sustaining mental effort, forgetting instructions, and impulsivity\nin individuals with ADHD. Complicating the differential diagnosis is the fact that some\nindividuals with ADHD may develop secondary oppositional attitudes toward such tasks\nand devalue their importance.\nIntermittent explosive disorder.\nADHD and intermittent explosive disorder share high\nlevels of impulsive behavior. However, individuals with intermittent explosive disorder\nshow serious aggression toward others, which is not characteristic of ADHD, and they do\nnot experience problems with sustaining attention as seen in ADHD. In addition, intermit-\ntent explosive disorder is rare in childhood. Intermittent explosive disorder may be diag-\nnosed in the presence of ADHD.\nOther neurodevelopmental disorders.\nThe increased motoric activity that may occur in\nADHD must be distinguished from the repetitive motor behavior that characterizes stereo-\ntypic movement disorder and some cases of autism spectrum disorder. In stereotypic\nmovement disorder, the motoric behavior is generally fixed and repetitive (e.g., body rock-\ning, self-biting), whereas the fidgetiness and restlessness in ADHD are typically general-\nized and not characterized by repetitive stereotypic movements. In Tourette’s disorder,\n64\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nfrequent multiple tics can be mistaken for the generalized fidgetiness of ADHD. Prolonged\nobservation may be needed to differentiate fidgetiness from bouts of multiple tics.\nSpecific learning disorder.\nChildren with specific learning disorder may appear inat-\ntentive because of frustration, lack of interest, or limited ability. However, inattention in\nindividuals with a specific learning disorder who do not have ADHD is not impairing out-\nside of academic work.\nIntellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).\nSymptoms of ADHD are\ncommon among children placed in academic settings that are inappropriate to their intel-\nlectual ability. In such cases, the symptoms are not evident during non-academic tasks. A\ndiagnosis of ADHD in intellectual disability requires that inattention or hyperactivity be\nexcessive for mental age.\nAutism spectrum disorder.\nIndividuals with ADHD and those with autism spectrum\ndisorder exhibit inattention, social dysfunction, and difficult-to-manage behavior. The so-\ncial dysfunction and peer rejection seen in individuals with ADHD must be distinguished\nfrom the social disengagement, isolation, and indifference to facial and tonal communica-\ntion cues seen in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Children with autism spec-\ntrum disorder may display tantrums because of an inability to tolerate a change from their\nexpected course of events. In contrast, children with ADHD may misbehave or have a tan-\ntrum during a major transition because of impulsivity or poor self-control.\nReactive attachment disorder.\nChildren with reactive attachment disorder may show\nsocial disinhibition, but not the full ADHD symptom cluster, and display other features\nsuch as a lack of enduring relationships that are not characteristic of ADHD.\nAnxiety disorders.\nADHD shares symptoms of inattention with anxiety disorders. Indi-\nviduals with ADHD are inattentive because of their attraction to external stimuli, new\nactivities, or preoccupation with enjoyable activities. This is distinguished from the inat-\ntention due to worry and rumination seen in anxiety disorders. Restlessness might be seen\nin anxiety disorders. However, in ADHD, the symptom is not associated with worry and\nrumination.\nDepressive disorders.\nIndividuals with depressive disorders may present with inabil-\nity to concentrate. However, poor concentration in mood disorders becomes prominent\nonly during a depressive episode.\nBipolar disorder.\nIndividuals with bipolar disorder may have increased activity, poor\nconcentration, and increased impulsivity, but these features are episodic, occurring sev-\neral days at a time. In bipolar disorder, increased impulsivity or inattention is accompa-\nnied by elevated mood, grandiosity, and other specific bipolar features. Children with\nADHD may show significant changes in mood within the same day; such lability is dis-\ntinct from a manic episode, which must last 4 or more days to be a clinical indicator of bi-\npolar disorder, even in children. Bipolar disorder is rare in preadolescents, even when\nsevere irritability and anger are prominent, whereas ADHD is common among children\nand adolescents who display excessive anger and irritability.\nDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder.\nDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder is\ncharacterized by pervasive irritability, and intolerance of frustration, but impulsiveness\nand disorganized attention are not essential features. However, most children and adoles-\ncents with the disorder have symptoms that also meet criteria for ADHD, which is diag-\nnosed separately.\nSubstance use disorders.\nDifferentiating ADHD from substance use disorders may be\nproblematic if the first presentation of ADHD symptoms follows the onset of abuse or fre-\nquent use. Clear evidence of ADHD before substance misuse from informants or previous\nrecords may be essential for differential diagnosis.\nOther Specified Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder\n65\nPersonality disorders.\nIn adolescents and adults, it may be difficult to distinguish ADHD\nfrom borderline, narcissistic, and other personality disorders. All these disorders tend to\nshare the features of disorganization, social intrusiveness, emotional dysregulation, and\ncognitive dysregulation. However, ADHD is not characterized by fear of abandonment,\nself-injury, extreme ambivalence, or other features of personality disorder. It may take\nextended clinical observation, informant interview, or detailed history to distinguish im-\npulsive, socially intrusive, or inappropriate behavior from narcissistic, aggressive, or dom-\nineering behavior to make this differential diagnosis.\nPsychotic disorders.\nADHD is not diagnosed if the symptoms of inattention and hyperac-\ntivity occur exclusively during the course of a psychotic disorder.\nMedication-induced symptoms of ADHD.\nSymptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or\nimpulsivity attributable to the use of medication (e.g., bronchodilators, isoniazid, neuro-\nleptics [resulting in akathisia], thyroid replacement medication) are diagnosed as other\nspecified or unspecified other (or unknown) substance–related disorders.\nNeurocognitive disorders.\nEarly major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) and/or\nmild neurocognitive disorder are not known to be associated with ADHD but may present\nwith similar clinical features. These conditions are distinguished from ADHD by their late\nonset.", "comorbidity": "In clinical settings, comorbid disorders are frequent in individuals whose symptoms meet\ncriteria for ADHD. In the general population, oppositional defiant disorder co-occurs with\nADHD in approximately half of children with the combined presentation and about a\nquarter with the predominantly inattentive presentation. Conduct disorder co-occurs in\nabout a quarter of children or adolescents with the combined presentation, depending on\nage and setting. Most children and adolescents with disruptive mood dysregulation dis-\norder have symptoms that also meet criteria for ADHD; a lesser percentage of children\nwith ADHD have symptoms that meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disor-\nder. Specific learning disorder commonly co-occurs with ADHD. Anxiety disorders and\nmajor depressive disorder occur in a minority of individuals with ADHD but more often\nthan in the general population. Intermittent explosive disorder occurs in a minority of\nadults with ADHD, but at rates above population levels. Although substance use disor-\nders are relatively more frequent among adults with ADHD in the general population, the\ndisorders are present in only a minority of adults with ADHD. In adults, antisocial and\nother personality disorders may co-occur with ADHD. Other disorders that may co-occur\nwith ADHD include obsessive-compulsive disorder, tic disorders, and autism spectrum\ndisorder."}, "provenance": {"source_file": "neurodevelopmental_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 10, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.483383"}}

Many individuals have good or\nfair insight (e.g., the individual believes that the house definitely will not, probably will not,\nor may or may not burn down if the stove is not checked 30 times). Some have poor insight\n(e.g., the individual believes that the house will probably burn down if the stove is not\nchecked 30 times), and a few (4% or less) have absent insight/delusional beliefs (e.g., the in-\ndividual is convinced that the house will burn down if the stove is not checked 30 times).\nInsight can vary within an individual over the course of the illness. Poorer insight has been\nlinked to worse long-term outcome.\nUp to 30% of individuals with OCD have a lifetime tic disorder. This is most common\nin males with onset of OCD in childhood. These individuals tend to differ from those with-\nout a history of tic disorders in the themes of their OCD symptoms, comorbidity, course,\nand pattern of familial transmission.", "recording_procedures": "", "diagnostic_features": "The characteristic symptoms of OCD are the presence of obsessions and compulsions (Cri-\nterion A). Obsessions are repetitive and persistent thoughts (e.g., of contamination), images\n(e.g., of violent or horrific scenes), or urges (e.g., to stab someone). Importantly, obsessions\nare not pleasurable or experienced as voluntary: they are intrusive and unwanted and\ncause marked distress or anxiety in most individuals. The individual attempts to ignore or\nsuppress these obsessions (e.g., avoiding triggers or using thought suppression) or to neu-\ntralize them with another thought or action (e.g., performing a compulsion). Compulsions\n(or rituals) are repetitive behaviors (e.g., washing, checking) or mental acts (e.g., counting,\nrepeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an\nobsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly. Most individuals with OCD\nhave both obsessions and compulsions. Compulsions are typically performed in response\nto an obsession (e.g., thoughts of contamination leading to washing rituals or that some-\nthing is incorrect leading to repeating rituals until it feels “just right”). The aim is to reduce\nthe distress triggered by obsessions or to prevent a feared event (e.g., becoming ill). How-\never, these compulsions either are not connected in a realistic way to the feared event (e.g.,\narranging items symmetrically to prevent harm to a loved one) or are clearly excessive\n(e.g., showering for hours each day). Compulsions are not done for pleasure, although some\nindividuals experience relief from anxiety or distress.\nCriterion B emphasizes that obsessions and compulsions must be time-consuming (e.g.,\nmore than 1 hour per day) or cause clinically significant distress or impairment to warrant\na diagnosis of OCD. This criterion helps to distinguish the disorder from the occasional in-\ntrusive thoughts or repetitive behaviors that are common in the general population (e.g.,\ndouble-checking that a door is locked). The frequency and severity of obsessions and com-\npulsions vary across individuals with OCD (e.g., some have mild to moderate symptoms,\nspending 1–3 hours per day obsessing or doing compulsions, whereas others have nearly\nconstant intrusive thoughts or compulsions that can be incapacitating).", "associated_features": "The specific content of obsessions and compulsions varies between individuals. However,\ncertain themes, or dimensions, are common, including those of cleaning (contamination\nobsessions and cleaning compulsions); symmetry (symmetry obsessions and repeating,\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder\n239\nordering, and counting compulsions); forbidden or taboo thoughts (e.g., aggressive, sexual,\nor religious obsessions and related compulsions); and harm (e.g., fears of harm to oneself\nor others and checking compulsions). Some individuals also have difficulties discarding\nand accumulate (hoard) objects as a consequence of typical obsessions and compulsions,\nsuch as fears of harming others. These themes occur across different cultures, are rela-\ntively consistent over time in adults with the disorder, and may be associated with differ-\nent neural substrates. Importantly, individuals often have symptoms in more than one\ndimension.\nIndividuals with OCD experience a range of affective responses when confronted with\nsituations that trigger obsessions and compulsions. For example, many individuals expe-\nrience marked anxiety that can include recurrent panic attacks. Others report strong feel-\nings of disgust. While performing compulsions, some individuals report a distressing\nsense of “incompleteness” or uneasiness until things look, feel, or sound “just right.”\nIt is common for individuals with the disorder to avoid people, places, and things that\ntrigger obsessions and compulsions. For example, individuals with contamination con-\ncerns might avoid public situations (e.g., restaurants, public restrooms) to reduce ex-\nposure to feared contaminants; individuals with intrusive thoughts about causing harm\nmight avoid social interactions.", "prevalence": "The 12-month prevalence of OCD in the United States is 1.2%, with a similar prevalence in-\nternationally (1.1%–1.8%). Females are affected at a slightly higher rate than males in\nadulthood, although males are more commonly affected in childhood.", "development_course": "In the United States, the mean age at onset of OCD is 19.5 years, and 25% of cases start by\nage 14 years. Onset after age 35 years is unusual but does occur. Males have an earlier age\nat onset than females: nearly 25% of males have onset before age 10 years. The onset of\nsymptoms is typically gradual; however, acute onset has also been reported.\nIf OCD is untreated, the course is usually chronic, often with waxing and waning symp-\ntoms. Some individuals have an episodic course, and a minority have a deteriorating\ncourse. Without treatment, remission rates in adults are low (e.g., 20% for those reevalu-\nated 40 years later). Onset in childhood or adolescence can lead to a lifetime of OCD. How-\never, 40% of individuals with onset of OCD in childhood or adolescence may experience\nremission by early adulthood. The course of OCD is often complicated by the co-occurrence\nof other disorders (see section “Comorbidity” for this disorder).\nCompulsions are more easily diagnosed in children than obsessions are because com-\npulsions are observable. However, most children have both obsessions and compulsions\n(as do most adults). The pattern of symptoms in adults can be stable over time, but it is\nmore variable in children. Some differences in the content of obsessions and compulsions\nhave been reported when children and adolescent samples have been compared with\nadult samples. These differences likely reflect content appropriate to different develop-\nmental stages (e.g., higher rates of sexual and religious obsessions in adolescents than in\nchildren; higher rates of harm obsessions [e.g., fears of catastrophic events, such as death\nor illness to self or loved ones] in children and adolescents than in adults).", "risk_factors": "Temperamental.\nGreater internalizing symptoms, higher negative emotionality, and\nbehavioral inhibition in childhood are possible temperamental risk factors.\nEnvironmental.\nPhysical and sexual abuse in childhood and other stressful or traumatic\nevents have been associated with an increased risk for developing OCD. Some children\n240\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\nmay develop the sudden onset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, which has been asso-\nciated with different environmental factors, including various infectious agents and a\npost-infectious autoimmune syndrome.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThe rate of OCD among first-degree relatives of adults with\nOCD is approximately two times that among first-degree relatives of those without the\ndisorder; however, among first-degree relatives of individuals with onset of OCD in child-\nhood or adolescence, the rate is increased 10-fold. Familial transmission is due in part to\ngenetic factors (e.g., a concordance rate of 0.57 for monozygotic vs. 0.22 for dizygotic twins).\nDysfunction in the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and striatum have been\nmost strongly implicated.", "cultural_issues": "OCD occurs across the world. There is substantial similarity across cultures in the gender\ndistribution, age at onset, and comorbidity of OCD. Moreover, around the globe, there is a\nsimilar symptom structure involving cleaning, symmetry, hoarding, taboo thoughts, or\nfear of harm. However, regional variation in symptom expression exists, and cultural\nfactors may shape the content of obsessions and compulsions.", "gender_issues": "Males have an earlier age at onset of OCD than females and are more likely to have co-\nmorbid tic disorders. Gender differences in the pattern of symptom dimensions have been\nreported, with, for example, females more likely to have symptoms in the cleaning dimen-\nsion and males more likely to have symptoms in the forbidden thoughts and symmetry di-\nmensions. Onset or exacerbation of OCD, as well as symptoms that can interfere with the\nmother-infant relationship (e.g., aggressive obsessions leading to avoidance of the infant),\nhave been reported in the peripartum period.", "diagnostic_markers": "", "suicide_risk": "Suicidal thoughts occur at some point in as many as about half of individuals with OCD.\nSuicide attempts are also reported in up to one-quarter of individuals with OCD; the pres-\nence of comorbid major depressive disorder increases the risk.", "functional_consequences": "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\nOCD is associated with reduced quality of life as well as high levels of social and occupa-\ntional impairment. Impairment occurs across many different domains of life and is asso-\nciated with symptom severity. Impairment can be caused by the time spent obsessing and\ndoing compulsions. Avoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions or compulsions\ncan also severely restrict functioning. In addition, specific symptoms can create specific\nobstacles. For example, obsessions about harm can make relationships with family and\nfriends feel hazardous; the result can be avoidance of these relationships. Obsessions\nabout symmetry can derail the timely completion of school or work projects because the\nproject never feels “just right,” potentially resulting in school failure or job loss. Health\nconsequences can also occur. For example, individuals with contamination concerns may\navoid doctors’ offices and hospitals (e.g., because of fears of exposure to germs) or develop\ndermatological problems (e.g., skin lesions due to excessive washing). Sometimes the\nsymptoms of the disorder interfere with its own treatment (e.g., when medications are con-\nsidered contaminated). When the disorder starts in childhood or adolescence, individuals\nmay experience developmental difficulties. For example, adolescents may avoid socializ-\ning with peers; young adults may struggle when they leave home to live independently.\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder\n241\nThe result can be few significant relationships outside the family and a lack of autonomy\nand financial independence from their family of origin. In addition, some individuals with\nOCD try to impose rules and prohibitions on family members because of their disorder\n(e.g., no one in the family can have visitors to the house for fear of contamination), and this\ncan lead to family dysfunction.", "differential_diagnosis": "Anxiety disorders.\nRecurrent thoughts, avoidant behaviors, and repetitive requests for\nreassurance can also occur in anxiety disorders. However, the recurrent thoughts that are\npresent in generalized anxiety disorder (i.e., worries) are usually about real-life concerns,\nwhereas the obsessions of OCD usually do not involve real-life concerns and can include\ncontent that is odd, irrational, or of a seemingly magical nature; moreover, compulsions\nare often present and usually linked to the obsessions. Like individuals with OCD, indi-\nviduals with specific phobia can have a fear reaction to specific objects or situations; how-\never, in specific phobia the feared object is usually much more circumscribed, and rituals\nare not present. In social anxiety disorder (social phobia), the feared objects or situations\nare limited to social interactions, and avoidance or reassurance seeking is focused on re-\nducing this social fear.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nOCD can be distinguished from the rumination of major\ndepressive disorder, in which thoughts are usually mood-congruent and not necessarily\nexperienced as intrusive or distressing; moreover, ruminations are not linked to compul-\nsions, as is typical in OCD.\nOther obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nIn body dysmorphic disorder, the\nobsessions and compulsions are limited to concerns about physical appearance; and in\ntrichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), the compulsive behavior is limited to hair pulling\nin the absence of obsessions. Hoarding disorder symptoms focus exclusively on the per-\nsistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, marked distress associated with\ndiscarding items, and excessive accumulation of objects. However, if an individual has ob-\nsessions that are typical of OCD (e.g., concerns about incompleteness or harm), and these\nobsessions lead to compulsive hoarding behaviors (e.g., acquiring all objects in a set to at-\ntain a sense of completeness or not discarding old newspapers because they may contain\ninformation that could prevent harm), a diagnosis of OCD should be given instead.\nEating disorders.\nOCD can be distinguished from anorexia nervosa in that in OCD the\nobsessions and compulsions are not limited to concerns about weight and food.\nTics (in tic disorder) and stereotyped movements.\nA tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent,\nnonrhythmic motor movement or vocalization (e.g., eye blinking, throat clearing). A ste-\nreotyped movement is a repetitive, seemingly driven, nonfunctional motor behavior (e.g.,\nhead banging, body rocking, self-biting). Tics and stereotyped movements are typically\nless complex than compulsions and are not aimed at neutralizing obsessions. However,\ndistinguishing between complex tics and compulsions can be difficult. Whereas compul-\nsions are usually preceded by obsessions, tics are often preceded by premonitory sensory\nurges. Some individuals have symptoms of both OCD and a tic disorder, in which case\nboth diagnoses may be warranted.\nPsychotic disorders.\nSome individuals with OCD have poor insight or even delusional\nOCD beliefs. However, they have obsessions and compulsions (distinguishing their\ncondition from delusional disorder) and do not have other features of schizophrenia or\nschizoaffective disorder (e.g., hallucinations or formal thought disorder).\nOther compulsive-like behaviors.\nCertain behaviors are sometimes described as “com-\npulsive,” including sexual behavior (in the case of paraphilias), gambling (i.e., gambling\n242\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\ndisorder), and substance use (e.g., alcohol use disorder). However, these behaviors differ\nfrom the compulsions of OCD in that the person usually derives pleasure from the activity\nand may wish to resist it only because of its deleterious consequences.\nObsessive-compulsive personality disorder.\nAlthough obsessive-compulsive person-\nality disorder and OCD have similar names, the clinical manifestations of these disorders\nare quite different. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is not characterized by in-\ntrusive thoughts, images, or urges or by repetitive behaviors that are performed in re-\nsponse to these intrusions; instead, it involves an enduring and pervasive maladaptive\npattern of excessive perfectionism and rigid control. If an individual manifests symptoms\nof both OCD and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, both diagnoses can be given.", "comorbidity": "Individuals with OCD often have other psychopathology. Many adults with the disorder\nhave a lifetime diagnosis of an anxiety disorder (76%; e.g., panic disorder, social anxiety\ndisorder, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia) or a depressive or bipolar disorder\n(63% for any depressive or bipolar disorder, with the most common being major depres-\nsive disorder [41%]). Onset of OCD is usually later than for most comorbid anxiety disor-\nders (with the exception of separation anxiety disorder) and PTSD but often precedes that\nof depressive disorders. Comorbid obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is also\ncommon in individuals with OCD (e.g., ranging from 23% to 32%).\nUp to 30% of individuals with OCD also have a lifetime tic disorder. A comorbid tic\ndisorder is most common in males with onset of OCD in childhood. These individuals\ntend to differ from those without a history of tic disorders in the themes of their OCD\nsymptoms, comorbidity, course, and pattern of familial transmission. A triad of OCD, tic\ndisorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder can also be seen in children.\nDisorders that occur more frequently in individuals with OCD than in those without\nthe disorder include several obsessive-compulsive and related disorders such as body\ndysmorphic disorder, trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), and excoriation (skin-pick-\ning) disorder. Finally, an association between OCD and some disorders characterized by\nimpulsivity, such as oppositional defiant disorder, has been reported.\nOCD is also much more common in individuals with certain other disorders than\nwould be expected based on its prevalence in the general population; when one of those\nother disorders is diagnosed, the individual should be assessed for OCD as well. For ex-\nample, in individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the prevalence of\nOCD is approximately 12%. Rates of OCD are also elevated in bipolar disorder; eating dis-\norders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa; and Tourette’s disorder."}, "provenance": {"source_file": "ocd_related_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 1, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.491384"}}

The most frequent form of acquisition is excessive\nbuying, followed by acquisition of free items (e.g., leaflets, items discarded by others).\nStealing is less common. Some individuals may deny excessive acquisition when first as-\nsessed, yet it may appear later during the course of treatment. Individuals with hoarding\ndisorder typically experience distress if they are unable to or are prevented from acquiring\nitems.", "recording_procedures": "", "diagnostic_features": "The essential feature of hoarding disorder is persistent difficulties discarding or parting\nwith possessions, regardless of their actual value (Criterion A). The term persistent indi-\ncates a long-standing difficulty rather than more transient life circumstances that may lead\nto excessive clutter, such as inheriting property. The difficulty in discarding possessions\nnoted in Criterion A refers to any form of discarding, including throwing away, selling,\ngiving away, or recycling. The main reasons given for these difficulties are the perceived\nutility or aesthetic value of the items or strong sentimental attachment to the possessions.\nSome individuals feel responsible for the fate of their possessions and often go to great\nlengths to avoid being wasteful. Fears of losing important information are also common.\nThe most commonly saved items are newspapers, magazines, old clothing, bags, books,\nmail, and paperwork, but virtually any item can be saved. The nature of items is not lim-\nited to possessions that most other people would define as useless or of limited value.\nMany individuals collect and save large numbers of valuable things as well, which are of-\nten found in piles mixed with other less valuable items.\nIndividuals with hoarding disorder purposefully save possessions and experience dis-\ntress when facing the prospect of discarding them (Criterion B). This criterion emphasizes\nthat the saving of possessions is intentional, which discriminates hoarding disorder from\nother forms of psychopathology that are characterized by the passive accumulation of\nitems or the absence of distress when possessions are removed.\nIndividuals accumulate large numbers of items that fill up and clutter active living ar-\neas to the extent that their intended use is no longer possible (Criterion C). For example,\nthe individual may not be able to cook in the kitchen, sleep in his or her bed, or sit in a\nchair. If the space can be used, it is only with great difficulty. Clutter is defined as a large\ngroup of usually unrelated or marginally related objects piled together in a disorganized\nfashion in spaces designed for other purposes (e.g., tabletops, floor, hallway). Criterion C\nemphasizes the “active” living areas of the home, rather than more peripheral areas, such\nas garages, attics, or basements, that are sometimes cluttered in homes of individuals with-\nout hoarding disorder. However, individuals with hoarding disorder often have posses-\nsions that spill beyond the active living areas and can occupy and impair the use of other\nspaces, such as vehicles, yards, the workplace, and friends’ and relatives’ houses. In some\ncases, living areas may be uncluttered because of the intervention of third parties (e.g.,\nfamily members, cleaners, local authorities). Individuals who have been forced to clear\ntheir homes still have a symptom picture that meets criteria for hoarding disorder because\nthe lack of clutter is due to a third-party intervention. Hoarding disorder contrasts with\nnormative collecting behavior, which is organized and systematic, even if in some cases\nthe actual amount of possessions may be similar to the amount accumulated by an indi-\nvidual with hoarding disorder. Normative collecting does not produce the clutter, dis-\ntress, or impairment typical of hoarding disorder.\nSymptoms (i.e., difficulties discarding and/or clutter) must cause clinically significant\ndistress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning, in-\ncluding maintaining a safe environment for self and others (Criterion D). In some cases,\nHoarding Disorder\n249\nparticularly when there is poor insight, the individual may not report distress, and the im-\npairment may be apparent only to those around the individual. However, any attempts to\ndiscard or clear the possessions by third parties result in high levels of distress.", "associated_features": "Other common features of hoarding disorder include indecisiveness, perfectionism,\navoidance, procrastination, difficulty planning and organizing tasks, and distractibility.\nSome individuals with hoarding disorder live in unsanitary conditions that may be a log-\nical consequence of severely cluttered spaces and/or that are related to planning and or-\nganizing difficulties. Animal hoarding can be defined as the accumulation of a large number\nof animals and a failure to provide minimal standards of nutrition, sanitation, and veter-\ninary care and to act on the deteriorating condition of the animals (including disease, star-\nvation, or death) and the environment (e.g., severe overcrowding, extremely unsanitary\nconditions). Animal hoarding may be a special manifestation of hoarding disorder. Most\nindividuals who hoard animals also hoard inanimate objects. The most prominent differ-\nences between animal and object hoarding are the extent of unsanitary conditions and the\npoorer insight in animal hoarding.", "prevalence": "Nationally representative prevalence studies of hoarding disorder are not available. Com-\nmunity surveys estimate the point prevalence of clinically significant hoarding in the\nUnited States and Europe to be approximately 2%–6%. Hoarding disorder affects both\nmales and females, but some epidemiological studies have reported a significantly greaterfemale.

Hoarding symp-\ntoms may first emerge around ages 11–15 years, start interfering with the individual’s ev-\neryday functioning by the mid-20s, and cause clinically significant impairment by the\nmid-30s. Participants in clinical research studies are usually in their 50s. Thus, the severity\nof hoarding increases with each decade of life. Once symptoms begin, the course of hoard-\ning is often chronic, with few individuals reporting a waxing and waning course.\nPathological hoarding in children appears to be easily distinguished from develop-\nmentally adaptive saving and collecting behaviors. Because children and adolescents\ntypically do not control their living environment and discarding behaviors, the possible\nintervention of third parties (e.g., parents keeping the spaces usable and thus reducing in-\nterference) should be considered when making the diagnosis.", "risk_factors": "Temperamental.\nIndecisiveness is a prominent feature of individuals with hoarding dis-\norder and their first-degree relatives.\nEnvironmental.\nIndividuals with hoarding disorder often retrospectively report stressful\nand traumatic life events preceding the onset of the disorder or causing an exacerbation.\nGenetic and physiological.\nHoarding behavior is familial, with about 50% of individu-\nals who hoard reporting having a relative who also hoards.

Appliances may be broken, and utilities such as water\nand electricity may be disconnected, as access for repair work may be difficult. Quality of\nlife is often considerably impaired. In severe cases, hoarding can put individuals at risk for\nfire, falling (especially elderly individuals), poor sanitation, and other health risks. Hoard-\ning disorder is associated with occupational impairment, poor physical health, and high\nsocial service utilization. Family relationships are frequently under great strain. Conflict\nwith neighbors and local authorities is common, and a substantial proportion of individ-\nuals with severe hoarding disorder have been involved in legal eviction proceedings, and\nsome have a history of eviction.", "differential_diagnosis": "Other medical conditions.\nHoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms are\njudged to be a direct consequence of another medical condition (Criterion E), such as trau-\nmatic brain injury, surgical resection for treatment of a tumor or seizure control, cerebro-\nvascular disease, infections of the central nervous system (e.g., herpes simplex encephalitis),\nor neurogenetic conditions such as Prader-Willi syndrome. Damage to the anterior ven-\ntromedial prefrontal and cingulate cortices has been particularly associated with the ex-\ncessive accumulation of objects. In these individuals, the hoarding behavior is not present\nprior to the onset of the brain damage and appears shortly after the brain damage occurs.\nSome of these individuals appear to have little interest in the accumulated items and are\nable to discard them easily or do not care if others discard them, whereas others appear to\nbe very reluctant to discard anything.\nNeurodevelopmental disorders.\nHoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumula-\ntion of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of a neurodevelopmental disorder, such\nas autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).\nSchizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.\nHoarding disorder is not di-\nagnosed if the accumulation of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of delusions or\nnegative symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.\nMajor depressive episode.\nHoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of\nobjects is judged to be a direct consequence of psychomotor retardation, fatigue, or loss of\nenergy during a major depressive episode.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nHoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms\nare judged to be a direct consequence of typical obsessions or compulsions, such as fears\nof contamination, harm, or feelings of incompleteness in obsessive-compulsive disorder\n(OCD). Feelings of incompleteness (e.g., losing one’s identity, or having to document and\npreserve all life experiences) are the most frequent OCD symptoms associated with this\nform of hoarding. The accumulation of objects can also be the result of persistently avoid-\nTrichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)\n251\ning onerous rituals (e.g., not discarding objects in order to avoid endless washing or check-\ning rituals).\nIn OCD, the behavior is generally unwanted and highly distressing, and the individual ex-\nperiences no pleasure or reward from it. Excessive acquisition is usually not present; if exces-\nsive acquisition is present, items are acquired because of a specific obsession (e.g., the need to\nbuy items that have been accidentally touched in order to avoid contaminating other people),\nnot because of a genuine desire to possess the items. Individuals who hoard in the context of\nOCD are also more likely to accumulate bizarre items, such as trash, feces, urine, nails, hair,\nused diapers, or rotten food. Accumulation of such items is very unusual in hoarding disorder.\nWhen severe hoarding appears concurrently with other typical symptoms of OCD but\nis judged to be independent from these symptoms, both hoarding disorder and OCD may\nbe diagnosed.\nNeurocognitive disorders.\nHoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of\nobjects is judged to be a direct consequence of a degenerative disorder, such as neurocog-\nnitive disorder associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration or Alzheimer’s disease.\nTypically, onset of the accumulating behavior is gradual and follows onset of the neuro-\ncognitive disorder.

The perception of impending separation or rejection,\nor the loss of external structure, can lead to profound changes in self-image, affect, cognition,\nand behavior. These individuals are very sensitive to environmental circumstances. They ex-\nperience intense abandonment fears and inappropriate anger even when faced with a real-\nistic time-limited separation or when there are unavoidable changes in plans (e.g., sudden\ndespair in reaction to a clinician’s announcing the end of the hour; panic or fury when some-\none important to them is just a few minutes late or must cancel an appointment). They may\nbelieve that this “abandonment” implies they are “bad.” These abandonment fears are re-\nlated to an intolerance of being alone and a need to have other people with them. Their frantic\n664\nPersonality Disorders\nefforts to avoid abandonment may include impulsive actions such as self-mutilating or sui-\ncidal behaviors, which are described separately in Criterion 5.\nIndividuals with borderline personality disorder have a pattern of unstable and intense\nrelationships (Criterion 2). They may idealize potential caregivers or lovers at the first or\nsecond meeting, demand to spend a lot of time together, and share the most intimate details\nearly in a relationship. However, they may switch quickly from idealizing other people to\ndevaluing them, feeling that the other person does not care enough, does not give enough,\nor is not “there” enough. These individuals can empathize with and nurture other people,\nbut only with the expectation that the other person will “be there” in return to meet their\nown needs on demand. These individuals are prone to sudden and dramatic shifts in their\nview of others, who may alternatively be seen as beneficent supports or as cruelly punitive.\nSuch shifts often reflect disillusionment with a caregiver whose nurturing qualities had\nbeen idealized or whose rejection or abandonment is expected.\nThere may be an identity disturbance characterized by markedly and persistently un-\nstable self-image or sense of self (Criterion 3). There are sudden and dramatic shifts in self-\nimage, characterized by shifting goals, values, and vocational aspirations. There may be\nsudden changes in opinions and plans about career, sexual identity, values, and types of\nfriends. These individuals may suddenly change from the role of a needy supplicant for\nhelp to that of a righteous avenger of past mistreatment. Although they usually have a self-\nimage that is based on being bad or evil, individuals with this disorder may at times have\nfeelings that they do not exist at all. Such experiences usually occur in situations in which\nthe individual feels a lack of a meaningful relationship, nurturing, and support. These in-\ndividuals may show worse performance in unstructured work or school situations.\nIndividuals with borderline personality disorder display impulsivity in at least two areas\nthat are potentially self-damaging (Criterion 4). They may gamble, spend money irrespon-\nsibly, binge eat, abuse substances, engage in unsafe sex, or drive recklessly. Individuals\nwith this disorder display recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilat-\ning behavior (Criterion 5). Completed suicide occurs in 8%–10% of such individuals, and\nself-mutilative acts (e.g., cutting or burning) and suicide threats and attempts are very\ncommon. Recurrent suicidality is often the reason that these individuals present for help.\nThese self-destructive acts are usually precipitated by threats of separation or rejection or\nby expectations that the individual assumes increased responsibility. Self-mutilation may\noccur during dissociative experiences and often brings relief by reaffirming the ability to\nfeel or by expiating the individual’s sense of being evil.\nIndividuals with borderline personality disorder may display affective instability that\nis due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anx-\niety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days) (Criterion 6). The\nbasic dysphoric mood of those with borderline personality disorder is often disrupted by\nperiods of anger, panic, or despair and is rarely relieved by periods of well-being or satis-\nfaction. These episodes may reflect the individual’s extreme reactivity to interpersonal\nstresses. Individuals with borderline personality disorder may be troubled by chronic feel-\nings of emptiness (Criterion 7). Easily bored, they may constantly seek something to do.\nIndividuals with this disorder frequently express inappropriate, intense anger or have dif-\nficulty controlling their anger (Criterion 8). They may display extreme sarcasm, enduring\nbitterness, or verbal outbursts. The anger is often elicited when a caregiver or lover is seen\nas neglectful, withholding, uncaring, or abandoning. Such expressions of anger are often\nfollowed by shame and guilt and contribute to the feeling they have of being evil. During\nperiods of extreme stress, transient paranoid ideation or dissociative symptoms (e.g., de-\npersonalization) may occur (Criterion 9), but these are generally of insufficient severity or\nduration to warrant an additional diagnosis. These episodes occur most frequently in re-\nsponse to a real or imagined abandonment. Symptoms tend to be transient, lasting min-\nutes or hours.

Some in-\ndividuals develop psychotic-like symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, body-image distortions,\nideas of reference, hypnagogic phenomena) during times of stress.

It is therefore im-\nportant to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in their characteristic\nfeatures. However, if an individual has personality features that meet criteria for one or\nmore personality disorders in addition to borderline personality disorder, all can be diag-\nnosed. Although histrionic personality disorder can also be characterized by attention seek-\ning, manipulative behavior, and rapidly shifting emotions, borderline personality disorder\nis distinguished by self-destructiveness, angry disruptions in close relationships, and\nchronic feelings of deep emptiness and loneliness. Paranoid ideas or illusions may be pres-\nent in both borderline personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder, but these\nsymptoms are more transient, interpersonally reactive, and responsive to external structur-\ning in borderline personality disorder.

Although antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder\nare both characterized by manipulative behavior, individuals with antisocial personality\ndisorder are manipulative to gain profit, power, or some other material gratification,\nwhereas the goal in borderline personality disorder is directed more toward gaining the con-\ncern of caretakers. Both dependent personality disorder and borderline personality disorder\nare characterized by fear of abandonment; however, the individual with borderline person-\nality disorder reacts to abandonment with feelings of emotional emptiness, rage, and de-\nmands, whereas the individual with dependent personality disorder reacts with increasing\nappeasement and submissiveness and urgently seeks a replacement relationship to provide\ncaregiving and support.

They may blithely assume that others attribute the same value to\ntheir efforts and may be surprised when the praise they expect and feel they deserve is not\nforthcoming. Often implicit in the inflated judgments of their own accomplishments is an un-\nderestimation (devaluation) of the contributions of others. Individuals with narcissistic per-\nsonality disorder are often preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance,\nbeauty, or ideal love (Criterion 2). They may ruminate about “long overdue” admiration and\nprivilege and compare themselves favorably with famous or privileged people.\nIndividuals with narcissistic personality disorder believe that they are superior, spe-\ncial, or unique and expect others to recognize them as such (Criterion 3). They may feel\nthat they can only be understood by, and should only associate with, other people who are\nspecial or of high status and may attribute “unique,” “perfect,” or “gifted” qualities to those\nwith whom they associate. Individuals with this disorder believe that their needs are spe-\ncial and beyond the ken of ordinary people. Their own self-esteem is enhanced (i.e., “mir-\nrored”) by the idealized value that they assign to those with whom they associate. They are\nlikely to insist on having only the “top” person (doctor, lawyer, hairdresser, instructor) or\nbeing affiliated with the “best” institutions but may devalue the credentials of those who dis-\nappoint them.\nIndividuals with this disorder generally require excessive admiration (Criterion 4). Their\nself-esteem is almost invariably very fragile. They may be preoccupied with how well they\nare doing and how favorably they are regarded by others. This often takes the form of a need\nfor constant attention and admiration. They may expect their arrival to be greeted with great\nfanfare and are astonished if others do not covet their possessions. They may constantly fish\nfor compliments, often with great charm. A sense of entitlement is evident in these individ-\nuals’ unreasonable expectation of especially favorable treatment (Criterion 5). They expect\nto be catered to and are puzzled or furious when this does not happen. For example, they\nmay assume that they do not have to wait in line and that their priorities are so important\nthat others should defer to them, and then get irritated when others fail to assist “in their\nvery important work.” This sense of entitlement, combined with a lack of sensitivity to the\nwants and needs of others, may result in the conscious or unwitting exploitation of others\n(Criterion 6). They expect to be given whatever they want or feel they need, no matter what\nit might mean to others. For example, these individuals may expect great dedication from\nothers and may overwork them without regard for the impact on their lives. They tend to\nform friendships or romantic relationships only if the other person seems likely to advance\ntheir purposes or otherwise enhance their self-esteem. They often usurp special privileges\nand extra resources that they believe they deserve because they are so special.\nIndividuals with narcissistic personality disorder generally have a lack of empathy and\nhave difficulty recognizing the desires, subjective experiences, and feelings of others (Crite-\nrion 7). They may assume that others are totally concerned about their welfare. They tend to\ndiscuss their own concerns in inappropriate and lengthy detail, while failing to recognize\nthat others also have feelings and needs. They are often contemptuous and impatient with\nNarcissistic Personality Disorder\n671\nothers who talk about their own problems and concerns. These individuals may be oblivious\nto the hurt their remarks may inflict (e.g., exuberantly telling a former lover that “I am now\nin the relationship of a lifetime!”; boasting of health in front of someone who is sick). When\nrecognized, the needs, desires, or feelings of others are likely to be viewed disparagingly as\nsigns of weakness or vulnerability. Those who relate to individuals with narcissistic person-\nality disorder typically find an emotional coldness and lack of reciprocal interest.\nThese individuals are often envious of others or believe that others are envious of them\n(Criterion 8). They may begrudge others their successes or possessions, feeling that they better\ndeserve those achievements, admiration, or privileges. They may harshly devalue the contri-\nbutions of others, particularly when those individuals have received acknowledgment or\npraise for their accomplishments. Arrogant, haughty behaviors characterize these individuals;\nthey often display snobbish, disdainful, or patronizing attitudes (Criterion 9). For example, an\nindividual with this disorder may complain about a clumsy waiter’s “rudeness” or “stupidity”\nor conclude a medical evaluation with a condescending evaluation of the physician.", "associated_features": "Vulnerability in self-esteem makes individuals with narcissistic personality disorder very\nsensitive to “injury” from criticism or defeat. Although they may not show it outwardly,\ncriticism may haunt these individuals and may leave them feeling humiliated, degraded,\nhollow, and empty. They may react with disdain, rage, or defiant counterattack. Such ex-\nperiences often lead to social withdrawal or an appearance of humility that may mask and\nprotect the grandiosity. Interpersonal relations are typically impaired because of problems\nderived from entitlement, the need for admiration, and the relative disregard for the sen-\nsitivities of others. Though overweening ambition and confidence may lead to high\nachievement, performance may be disrupted because of intolerance of criticism or defeat.\nSometimes vocational functioning can be very low, reflecting an unwillingness to take a\nrisk in competitive or other situations in which defeat is possible. Sustained feelings of\nshame or humiliation and the attendant self-criticism may be associated with social with-\ndrawal, depressed mood, and persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) or major de-\npressive disorder.

It is, therefore, important to distinguish among these disorders based on differ-\nences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features\nthat meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to narcissistic person-\nality disorder, all can be diagnosed. The most useful feature in discriminating narcissistic\npersonality disorder from histrionic, antisocial, and borderline personality disorders, in\nwhich the interactive styles are coquettish, callous, and needy, respectively, is the grandi-\nosity characteristic of narcissistic personality disorder. The relative stability of self-image\nas well as the relative lack of self-destructiveness, impulsivity, and abandonment concerns\nalso help distinguish narcissistic personality disorder from borderline personality disor-\nder. Excessive pride in achievements, a relative lack of emotional display, and disdain for\nothers’ sensitivities help distinguish narcissistic personality disorder from histrionic\npersonality disorder. Although individuals with borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic\npersonality disorders may require much attention, those with narcissistic personality dis-\norder specifically need that attention to be admiring. Individuals with antisocial and nar-\ncissistic personality disorders share a tendency to be tough-minded, glib, superficial,\nexploitative, and unempathic. However, narcissistic personality disorder does not neces-\nsarily include characteristics of impulsivity, aggression, and deceit. In addition, individu-\nals with antisocial personality disorder may not be as needy of the admiration and envy of\nothers, and persons with narcissistic personality disorder usually lack the history of con-\nduct disorder in childhood or criminal behavior in adulthood. In both narcissistic person-\nality disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, the individual may profess\na commitment to perfectionism and believe that others cannot do things as well. In con-\ntrast to the accompanying self-criticism of those with obsessive-compulsive personality\ndisorder, individuals with narcissistic personality disorder are more likely to believe that\nthey have achieved perfection. Suspiciousness and social withdrawal usually distinguish\nthose with schizotypal or paranoid personality disorder from those with narcissistic per-\nsonality disorder. When these qualities are present in individuals with narcissistic person-\nality disorder, they derive primarily from fears of having imperfections or flaws revealed.\nMany highly successful individuals display personality traits that might be considered\nnarcissistic.

This pattern begins by early adulthood and is present\nin a variety of contexts.\nIndividuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder attempt to maintain a\nsense of control through painstaking attention to rules, trivial details, procedures, lists,\nschedules, or form to the extent that the major point of the activity is lost (Criterion 1). They\nare excessively careful and prone to repetition, paying extraordinary attention to detail\nand repeatedly checking for possible mistakes. They are oblivious to the fact that other\npeople tend to become very annoyed at the delays and inconveniences that result from this\nbehavior. For example, when such individuals misplace a list of things to be done, they\nwill spend an inordinate amount of time looking for the list rather than spending a few\nmoments re-creating it from memory and proceeding to accomplish the tasks. Time is\npoorly allocated, and the most important tasks are left to the last moment. The perfection-\nism and self-imposed high standards of performance cause significant dysfunction and\ndistress in these individuals. They may become so involved in making every detail of a\nproject absolutely perfect that the project is never finished (Criterion 2). For example, the\ncompletion of a written report is delayed by numerous time-consuming rewrites that all\ncome up short of “perfection.” Deadlines are missed, and aspects of the individual’s life\nthat are not the current focus of activity may fall into disarray.\nIndividuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder display excessive devotion\nto work and productivity to the exclusion of leisure activities and friendships (Criterion 3).\nThis behavior is not accounted for by economic necessity. They often feel that they do not\nhave time to take an evening or a weekend day off to go on an outing or to just relax. They\nmay keep postponing a pleasurable activity, such as a vacation, so that it may never occur.\nWhen they do take time for leisure activities or vacations, they are very uncomfortable un-\nless they have taken along something to work on so they do not “waste time.” There may be\na great concentration on household chores (e.g., repeated excessive cleaning so that “one\ncould eat off the floor”). If they spend time with friends, it is likely to be in some kind of for-\nmally organized activity (e.g., sports). Hobbies or recreational activities are approached as\nserious tasks requiring careful organization and hard work to master. The emphasis is on\nperfect performance. These individuals turn play into a structured task (e.g., correcting an\ninfant for not putting rings on the post in the right order; telling a toddler to ride his or her tri-\ncycle in a straight line; turning a baseball game into a harsh “lesson”).\nIndividuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder may be excessively con-\nscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about matters of morality, ethics, or values (Crite-\nrion 4). They may force themselves and others to follow rigid moral principles and very\nstrict standards of performance. They may also be mercilessly self-critical about their own\nmistakes. Individuals with this disorder are rigidly deferential to authority and rules and\ninsist on quite literal compliance, with no rule bending for extenuating circumstances. For\nexample, the individual will not lend a quarter to a friend who needs one to make a tele-\nphone call because “neither a borrower nor a lender be” or because it would be “bad” for\n680\nPersonality Disorders\nthe person’s character.

Their spouses or roommates may complain about the amount of\nspace taken up by old parts, magazines, broken appliances, and so on.\nIndividuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder are reluctant to delegate\ntasks or to work with others (Criterion 6). They stubbornly and unreasonably insist that\neverything be done their way and that people conform to their way of doing things. They\noften give very detailed instructions about how things should be done (e.g., there is one\nand only one way to mow the lawn, wash the dishes, build a doghouse) and are surprised\nand irritated if others suggest creative alternatives. At other times they may reject offers of\nhelp even when behind schedule because they believe no one else can do it right.\nIndividuals with this disorder may be miserly and stingy and maintain a standard of\nliving far below what they can afford, believing that spending must be tightly controlled to\nprovide for future catastrophes (Criterion 7). Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder\nis characterized by rigidity and stubbornness (Criterion 8). Individuals with this disorder\nare so concerned about having things done the one “correct” way that they have trouble\ngoing along with anyone else’s ideas. These individuals plan ahead in meticulous detail\nand are unwilling to consider changes. Totally wrapped up in their own perspective, they\nhave difficulty acknowledging the viewpoints of others.

They are prone to become upset or angry in situations in which they are not\nable to maintain control of their physical or interpersonal environment, although the an-\nger is typically not expressed directly. For example, an individual may be angry when ser-\nvice in a restaurant is poor, but instead of complaining to the management, the individual\nruminates about how much to leave as a tip. On other occasions, anger may be expressed\nwith righteous indignation over a seemingly minor matter. Individuals with this disorder\nmay be especially attentive to their relative status in dominance-submission relationships\nand may display excessive deference to an authority they respect and excessive resistance\nto authority they do not respect.\nIndividuals with this disorder usually express affection in a highly controlled or stilted\nfashion and may be very uncomfortable in the presence of others who are emotionally ex-\npressive. Their everyday relationships have a formal and serious quality, and they may be\nstiff in situations in which others would smile and be happy (e.g., greeting a lover at the\nairport).

The di-\nagnosis involves the recognition of a constellation of signs and symptoms associated with\nimpaired occupational or social functioning. Individuals with the disorder will vary sub-\nstantially on most features, as schizophrenia is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome.\nAt least two Criterion A symptoms must be present for a significant portion of time\nduring a 1-month period or longer. At least one of these symptoms must be the clear pres-\nence of delusions (Criterion A1), hallucinations (Criterion A2), or disorganized speech\n(Criterion A3). Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior (Criterion A4) and negative\nsymptoms (Criterion A5) may also be present. In those situations in which the active-\nphase symptoms remit within a month in response to treatment, Criterion A is still met if the\nclinician estimates that they would have persisted in the absence of treatment.\nSchizophrenia involves impairment in one or more major areas of functioning (Crite-\nrion B). If the disturbance begins in childhood or adolescence, the expected level of func-\ntion is not attained. Comparing the individual with unaffected siblings may be helpful. The\ndysfunction persists for a substantial period during the course of the disorder and does not\nappear to be a direct result of any single feature. Avolition (i.e., reduced drive to pursue\ngoal-directed behavior; Criterion A5) is linked to the social dysfunction described under\nCriterion B. There is also strong evidence for a relationship between cognitive impairment\n(see the section “Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis” for this disorder) and func-\ntional impairment in individuals with schizophrenia.\nSchizophrenia\n101\nSome signs of the disturbance must persist for a continuous period of at least 6 months\n(Criterion C). Prodromal symptoms often precede the active phase, and residual symp-\ntoms may follow it, characterized by mild or subthreshold forms of hallucinations or\ndelusions. Individuals may express a variety of unusual or odd beliefs that are not of de-\nlusional proportions (e.g., ideas of reference or magical thinking); they may have unusual\nperceptual experiences (e.g., sensing the presence of an unseen person); their speech may\nbe generally understandable but vague; and their behavior may be unusual but not grossly\ndisorganized (e.g., mumbling in public). Negative symptoms are common in the pro-\ndromal and residual phases and can be severe. Individuals who had been socially active\nmay become withdrawn from previous routines. Such behaviors are often the first sign of\na disorder.\nMood symptoms and full mood episodes are common in schizophrenia and may be con-\ncurrent with active-phase symptomatology. However, as distinct from a psychotic mood dis-\norder, a schizophrenia diagnosis requires the presence of delusions or hallucinations in the\nabsence of mood episodes. In addition, mood episodes, taken in total, should be present for\nonly a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.\nIn addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the\nassessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making crit-\nically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-\nchotic disorders.", "associated_features": "Individuals with schizophrenia may display inappropriate affect (e.g., laughing in the ab-\nsence of an appropriate stimulus); a dysphoric mood that can take the form of depression,\nanxiety, or anger; a disturbed sleep pattern (e.g., daytime sleeping and nighttime activity);\nand a lack of interest in eating or food refusal. Depersonalization, derealization, and so-\nmatic concerns may occur and sometimes reach delusional proportions. Anxiety and pho-\nbias are common. Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are common and are strongly linked\nto vocational and functional impairments. These deficits can include decrements in declar-\native memory, working memory, language function, and other executive functions, as well\nas slower processing speed. Abnormalities in sensory processing and inhibitory capacity,\nas well as reductions in attention, are also found. Some individuals with schizophrenia\nshow social cognition deficits, including deficits in the ability to infer the intentions of\nother people (theory of mind), and may attend to and then interpret irrelevant events or\nstimuli as meaningful, perhaps leading to the generation of explanatory delusions. These\nimpairments frequently persist during symptomatic remission.\nSome individuals with psychosis may lack insight or awareness of their disorder (i.e.,\nanosognosia). This lack of “insight” includes unawareness of symptoms of schizophrenia\nand may be present throughout the entire course of the illness. Unawareness of illness is\ntypically a symptom of schizophrenia itself rather than a coping strategy. It is comparable\nto the lack of awareness of neurological deficits following brain damage, termed anoso-\ngnosia. This symptom is the most common predictor of non-adherence to treatment, and it\npredicts higher relapse rates, increased number of involuntary treatments, poorer psycho-\nsocial functioning, aggression, and a poorer course of illness.\nHostility and aggression can be associated with schizophrenia, although spontaneous\nor random assault is uncommon. Aggression is more frequent for younger males and for\nindividuals with a past history of violence, non-adherence with treatment, substance\nabuse, and impulsivity. It should be noted that the vast majority of persons with schizo-\nphrenia are not aggressive and are more frequently victimized than are individuals in the\ngeneral population.\nCurrently, there are no radiological, laboratory, or psychometric tests for the disorder.\nDifferences are evident in multiple brain regions between groups of healthy individuals\n102\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\nand persons with schizophrenia, including evidence from neuroimaging, neuropatholog-\nical, and neurophysiological studies. Differences are also evident in cellular architecture,\nwhite matter connectivity, and gray matter volume in a variety of regions such as the pre-\nfrontal and temporal cortices. Reduced overall brain volume has been observed, as well as\nincreased brain volume reduction with age. Brain volume reductions with age are more\npronounced in individuals with schizophrenia than in healthy individuals. Finally, indi-\nviduals with schizophrenia appear to differ from individuals without the disorder in eye-\ntracking and electrophysiological indices.\nNeurological soft signs common in individuals with schizophrenia include impairments\nin motor coordination, sensory integration, and motor sequencing of complex movements;\nleft-right confusion; and disinhibition of associated movements. In addition, minor phys-\nical anomalies of the face and limbs may occur.", "prevalence": "The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia appears to be approximately 0.3%–0.7%, al-\nthough there is reported variation by race/ethnicity, across countries, and by geographic\norigin for immigrants and children of immigrants. The sex ratio differs across samples and\npopulations: for example, an emphasis on negative symptoms and longer duration of dis-\norder (associated with poorer outcome) shows higher incidence rates for males, whereas\ndefinitions allowing for the inclusion of more mood symptoms and brief presentations\n(associated with better outcome) show equivalent risks for both sexes.", "development_course": "The psychotic features of schizophrenia typically emerge between the late teens and the\nmid-30s; onset prior to adolescence is rare. The peak age at onset for the first psychotic ep-\nisode is in the early- to mid-20s for males and in the late-20s for females. The onset may be\nabrupt or insidious, but the majority of individuals manifest a slow and gradual develop-\nment of a variety of clinically significant signs and symptoms. Half of these individuals\ncomplain of depressive symptoms. Earlier age at onset has traditionally been seen as a pre-\ndictor of worse prognosis. However, the effect of age at onset is likely related to gender,\nwith males having worse premorbid adjustment, lower educational achievement, more\nprominent negative symptoms and cognitive impairment, and in general a worse out-\ncome. Impaired cognition is common, and alterations in cognition are present during de-\nvelopment and precede the emergence of psychosis, taking the form of stable cognitive\nimpairments during adulthood. Cognitive impairments may persist when other symptoms\nare in remission and contribute to the disability of the disease.\nThe predictors of course and outcome are largely unexplained, and course and outcome\nmay not be reliably predicted. The course appears to be favorable in about 20% of those\nwith schizophrenia, and a small number of individuals are reported to recover completely.\nHowever, most individuals with schizophrenia still require formal or informal daily living\nsupports, and many remain chronically ill, with exacerbations and remissions of active\nsymptoms, while others have a course of progressive deterioration.\nPsychotic symptoms tend to diminish over the life course, perhaps in association with\nnormal age-related declines in dopamine activity. Negative symptoms are more closely re-\nlated to prognosis than are positive symptoms and tend to be the most persistent. Further-\nmore, cognitive deficits associated with the illness may not improve over the course of the\nillness.\nThe essential features of schizophrenia are the same in childhood, but it is more diffi-\ncult to make the diagnosis. In children, delusions and hallucinations may be less elaborate\nthan in adults, and visual hallucinations are more common and should be distinguished\nfrom normal fantasy play. Disorganized speech occurs in many disorders with childhood\nonset (e.g., autism spectrum disorder), as does disorganized behavior (e.g., attention-deficit/\nSchizophrenia\n103\nhyperactivity disorder). These symptoms should not be attributed to schizophrenia with-\nout due consideration of the more common disorders of childhood. Childhood-onset cases\ntend to resemble poor-outcome adult cases, with gradual onset and prominent negative\nsymptoms. Children who later receive the diagnosis of schizophrenia are more likely to\nhave experienced nonspecific emotional-behavioral disturbances and psychopathology,\nintellectual and language alterations, and subtle motor delays.\nLate-onset cases (i.e., onset after age 40 years) are overrepresented by females, who\nmay have married. Often, the course is characterized by a predominance of psychotic\nsymptoms with preservation of affect and social functioning. Such late-onset cases can still\nmeet the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, but it is not yet clear whether this is the\nsame condition as schizophrenia diagnosed prior to mid-life (e.g., prior to age 55 years).", "risk_factors": "Environmental.\nSeason of birth has been linked to the incidence of schizophrenia, in-\ncluding late winter/early spring in some locations and summer for the deficit form of the\ndisease. The incidence of schizophrenia and related disorders is higher for children grow-\ning up in an urban environment and for some minority ethnic groups.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThere is a strong contribution for genetic factors in deter-\nmining risk for schizophrenia, although most individuals who have been diagnosed with\nschizophrenia have no family history of psychosis. Liability is conferred by a spectrum of\nrisk alleles, common and rare, with each allele contributing only a small fraction to the to-\ntal population variance. The risk alleles identified to date are also associated with other\nmental disorders, including bipolar disorder, depression, and autism spectrum disorder.\nPregnancy and birth complications with hypoxia and greater paternal age are associated\nwith a higher risk of schizophrenia for the developing fetus. In addition, other prenatal\nand perinatal adversities, including stress, infection, malnutrition, maternal diabetes, and\nother medical conditions, have been linked with schizophrenia. However, the vast major-\nity of offspring with these risk factors do not develop schizophrenia.", "cultural_issues": "Cultural and socioeconomic factors must be considered, particularly when the individual\nand the clinician do not share the same cultural and socioeconomic background. Ideas that\nappear to be delusional in one culture (e.g., witchcraft) may be commonly held in another.\nIn some cultures, visual or auditory hallucinations with a religious content (e.g., hearing\nGod’s voice) are a normal part of religious experience. In addition, the assessment of dis-\norganized speech may be made difficult by linguistic variation in narrative styles across\ncultures. The assessment of affect requires sensitivity to differences in styles of emotional\nexpression, eye contact, and body language, which vary across cultures. If the assessment\nis conducted in a language that is different from the individual’s primary language, care\nmust be taken to ensure that alogia is not related to linguistic barriers. In certain cultures,\ndistress may take the form of hallucinations or pseudo-hallucinations and overvalued\nideas that may present clinically similar to true psychosis but are normative to the pa-\ntient’s subgroup.", "gender_issues": "A number of features distinguish the clinical expression of schizophrenia in females and\nmales. The general incidence of schizophrenia tends to be slightly lower in females, par-\nticularly among treated cases. The age at onset is later in females, with a second mid-life\npeak as described earlier (see the section “Development and Course” for this disorder).\nSymptoms tend to be more affect-laden among females, and there are more psychotic\nsymptoms, as well as a greater propensity for psychotic symptoms to worsen in later life.\n104\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\nOther symptom differences include less frequent negative symptoms and disorganization.\nFinally, social functioning tends to remain better preserved in females. There are, how-\never, frequent exceptions to these general caveats.", "diagnostic_markers": "", "suicide_risk": "Approximately 5%–6% of individuals with schizophrenia die by suicide, about 20% attempt\nsuicide on one or more occasions, and many more have significant suicidal ideation. Suicidal\nbehavior is sometimes in response to command hallucinations to harm oneself or others.especially high for younger males with comorbid substance use. Other risk factors include\nhaving depressive symptoms or feelings of hopelessness and being unemployed, and the\nrisk is higher, also, in the period after a psychotic episode or hospital discharge.", "functional_consequences": "Schizophrenia is associated with significant social and occupational dysfunction. Making\neducational progress and maintaining employment are frequently impaired by avolition\nor other disorder manifestations, even when the cognitive skills are sufficient for the tasks\nat hand. Most individuals are employed at a lower level than their parents, and most, par-\nticularly men, do not marry or have limited social contacts outside of their family.", "differential_diagnosis": "Major depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic or catatonic features.\nThe distinc-\ntion between schizophrenia and major depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic\nfeatures or with catatonia depends on the temporal relationship between the mood distur-\nbance and the psychosis, and on the severity of the depressive or manic symptoms. If de-\nlusions or hallucinations occur exclusively during a major depressive or manic episode,\nthe diagnosis is depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features.\nSchizoaffective disorder.\nA diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that a major\ndepressive or manic episode occur concurrently with the active-phase symptoms and that\nthe mood symptoms be present for a majority of the total duration of the active periods.\nSchizophreniform disorder and brief psychotic disorder.\nThese disorders are of shorter\nduration than schizophrenia as specified in Criterion C, which requires 6 months of symp-\ntoms.

An individual with autism spectrum disorder or communication\ndisorder must have symptoms that meet full criteria for schizophrenia, with prominent\nhallucinations or delusions for at least 1 month, in order to be diagnosed with schizophre-\nnia as a comorbid condition.\nOther mental disorders associated with a psychotic episode.\nThe diagnosis of schizo-\nphrenia is made only when the psychotic episode is persistent and not attributable to the\nphysiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. Individuals with a de-\nlirium or major or minor neurocognitive disorder may present with psychotic symptoms,\nbut these would have a temporal relationship to the onset of cognitive changes consistent\nwith those disorders. Individuals with substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder\nmay present with symptoms characteristic of Criterion A for schizophrenia, but the sub-\nstance/medication-induced psychotic disorder can usually be distinguished by the chron-\nological relationship of substance use to the onset and remission of the psychosis in the\nabsence of substance use.", "comorbidity": "Rates of comorbidity with substance-related disorders are high in schizophrenia. Over\nhalf of individuals with schizophrenia have tobacco use disorder and smoke cigarettes\nregularly. Comorbidity with anxiety disorders is increasingly recognized in schizophre-\nnia.

For instance, insomnia may develop its own course with some anxiety and depres-\nsive features but in the absence of criteria being met for any one mental disorder. Insomnia\nmay also manifest as a clinical feature of a more predominant mental disorder. Persistent\ninsomnia may even be a risk factor for depression and is a common residual symptom af-\nter treatment for this condition. With comorbid insomnia and a mental disorder, treatment\nmay also need to target both conditions. Given these different courses, it is often impossi-\nble to establish the precise nature of the relationship between these clinical entities, and\nthis relationship may change over time. Therefore, in the presence of insomnia and a co-\nmorbid disorder, it is not necessary to make a causal attribution between the two condi-\ntions. Rather, the diagnosis of insomnia disorder is made with concurrent specification of\nthe clinically comorbid conditions. A concurrent insomnia diagnosis should only be con-\nsidered when the insomnia is sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention;\notherwise, no separate diagnosis is necessary.", "subtypes": "", "specifiers": "", "recording_procedures": "", "diagnostic_features": "The essential feature of insomnia disorder is dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality\nwith complaints of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep. The sleep complaints are ac-\ncompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other\nimportant areas of functioning. The sleep disturbance may occur during the course of an-\nother mental disorder or medical condition, or it may occur independently.\nDifferent manifestations of insomnia can occur at different times of the sleep period. Sleep-\nonset insomnia (or initial insomnia) involves difficulty initiating sleep at bedtime. Sleep mainte-\nnance insomnia (or middle insomnia) involves frequent or prolonged awakenings throughout\nthe night. Late insomnia involves early-morning awakening with an inability to return to sleep.\nDifficulty maintaining sleep is the most common single symptom of insomnia, followed by\ndifficulty falling asleep, while a combination of these symptoms is the most common presen-\ntation overall. The specific type of sleep complaint often varies over time. Individuals who\ncomplain of difficulty falling asleep at one time may later complain of difficulty maintaining\nsleep, and vice versa. Symptoms of difficulty falling asleep and difficulty maintaining sleep\ncan be quantified by the individual’s retrospective self-report, sleep diaries, or other methods,\nsuch as actigraphy or polysomnography, but the diagnosis of insomnia disorder is based on\nthe individual’s subjective perception of sleep or a caretaker’s report.\nNonrestorative sleep, a complaint of poor sleep quality that does not leave the individual\nrested upon awakening despite adequate duration, is a common sleep complaint usually\noccurring in association with difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or less frequently in\nisolation. This complaint can also be reported in association with other sleep disorders\n(e.g., breathing-related sleep disorder). When a complaint of nonrestorative sleep occurs\nin isolation (i.e., in the absence of difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep) but all di-\nagnostic criteria with regard to frequency, duration, and daytime distress and impairments\nare otherwise met, a diagnosis of other specified insomnia disorder or unspecified insom-\nnia disorder is made.\n364\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nAside from the frequency and duration criteria required to make the diagnosis, addi-\ntional criteria are useful to quantify insomnia severity. These quantitative criteria, while\narbitrary, are provided for illustrative purpose only. For instance, difficulty initiating sleep\nis defined by a subjective sleep latency greater than 20–30 minutes, and difficulty maintain-\ning sleep is defined by a subjective time awake after sleep onset greater than 20–30 min-\nutes. Although there is no standard definition of early-morning awakening, this symptom\ninvolves awakening at least 30 minutes before the scheduled time and before total sleep\ntime reaches 6½ hours. It is essential to take into account not only the final awakening time\nbut also the bedtime on the previous evening. Awakening at 4:00 A.M. does not have the\nsame clinical significance in those who go to bed at 9:00 P.M. as in those who go to bed at\n11:00 P.M. Such a symptom may also reflect an age-dependent decrease in the ability to sus-\ntain sleep or an age-dependent shift in the timing of the main sleep period.\nInsomnia disorder involves daytime impairments as well as nighttime sleep difficulties.\nThese include fatigue or, less commonly, daytime sleepiness; the latter is more common\namong older individuals and when insomnia is comorbid with another medical condition\n(e.g., chronic pain) or sleep disorder (e.g., sleep apnea). Impairment in cognitive performance\nmay include difficulties with attention, concentration and memory, and even with performing\nsimple manual skills. Associated mood disturbances are typically described as irritability or\nmood lability and less commonly as depressive or anxiety symptoms. Not all individuals with\nnighttime sleep disturbances are distressed or have functional impairment. For example, sleep\ncontinuity is often interrupted in healthy older adults who nevertheless identify themselves\nas good sleepers. A diagnosis of insomnia disorder should be reserved for those individuals\nwith significant daytime distress or impairment related to their nighttime sleep difficulties.", "associated_features": "Insomnia is often associated with physiological and cognitive arousal and conditioning\nfactors that interfere with sleep. A preoccupation with sleep and distress due to the inabil-\nity to sleep may lead to a vicious cycle: the more the individual strives to sleep, the more\nfrustration builds and further impairs sleep. Thus, excessive attention and efforts to sleep,\nwhich override normal sleep-onset mechanisms, may contribute to the development of in-\nsomnia. Individuals with persistent insomnia may also acquire maladaptive sleep habits\n(e.g., spending excessive time in bed; following an erratic sleep schedule; napping) and\ncognitions (e.g., fear of sleeplessness; apprehensions of daytime impairments; clock mon-\nitoring) during the course of the disorder. Engaging in such activities in an environment in\nwhich the individual has frequently spent sleepless nights may further compound the con-\nditioned arousal and perpetuate sleep difficulties. Conversely, the individual may fall asleep\nmore easily when not trying to do so. Some individuals also report better sleep when away\nfrom their own bedrooms and their usual routines.\nInsomnia may be accompanied by a variety of daytime complaints and symptoms, in-\ncluding fatigue, decreased energy, and mood disturbances. Symptoms of anxiety or de-\npression that do not meet criteria for a specific mental disorder may be present, as well as\nan excessive focus on the perceived effects of sleep loss on daytime functioning.\nIndividuals with insomnia may have elevated scores on self-report psychological or\npersonality inventories with profiles indicating mild depression and anxiety, a worrisome\ncognitive style, an emotion-focused and internalizing style of conflict resolution, and a so-\nmatic focus. Patterns of neurocognitive impairment among individuals with insomnia dis-\norder are inconsistent, although there may be impairments in performing tasks of higher\ncomplexity and those requiring frequent changes in performance strategy. Individuals\nwith insomnia often require more effort to maintain cognitive performance.", "prevalence": "Population-based estimates indicate that about one-third of adults report insomnia symp-\ntoms, 10%–15% experience associated daytime impairments, and 6%–10% have symptoms\nInsomnia Disorder\n365\nthat meet criteria for insomnia disorder. Insomnia disorder is the most prevalent of all\nsleep disorders. In primary care settings, approximately 10%–20% of individuals complain\nof significant insomnia symptoms. Insomnia is a more prevalent complaint among fe-\nmales than among males, with a gender ratio of about 1.44:1. Although insomnia can be a\nsymptom or an independent disorder, it is most frequently observed as a comorbid con-\ndition with another medical condition or mental disorder. For instance, 40%–50% of indi-\nviduals with insomnia also present with a comorbid mental disorder.", "development_course": "The onset of insomnia symptoms can occur at any time during life, but the first episode is\nmore common in young adulthood. Less frequently, insomnia begins in childhood or ad-\nolescence. In women, new-onset insomnia may occur during menopause and persist even\nafter other symptoms (e.g., hot flashes) have resolved. Insomnia may have a late-life onset,\nwhich is often associated with the onset of other health-related conditions.\nInsomnia can be situational, persistent, or recurrent. Situational or acute insomnia usu-\nally lasts a few days or a few weeks and is often associated with life events or rapid changes\nin sleep schedules or environment. It usually resolves once the initial precipitating event\nsubsides. For some individuals, perhaps those more vulnerable to sleep disturbances, in-\nsomnia may persist long after the initial triggering event, possibly because of conditioning\nfactors and heightened arousal. The factors that precipitate insomnia may differ from\nthose that perpetuate it. For example, an individual who is bedridden with a painful injury\nand has difficulty sleeping may then develop negative associations for sleep. Conditioned\narousal may then persist and lead to persistent insomnia. A similar course may develop in\nthe context of an acute psychological stress or a mental disorder. For instance, insomnia that\noccurs during an episode of major depressive disorder can become a focus of attention,\nwith consequent negative conditioning, and persist even after resolution of the depressive\nepisode. In some cases, insomnia may also have an insidious onset without any identifi-\nable precipitating factor.\nThe course of insomnia may also be episodic, with recurrent episodes of sleep difficul-\nties associated with the occurrence of stressful events. Chronicity rates range from 45%\nto 75% for follow-ups of 1–7 years. Even when the course of the insomnia has become\nchronic, there is night-to-night variability in sleep patterns, with an occasional restful night’s\nsleep interspersed with several nights of poor sleep. The characteristics of insomnia may\nalso change over time. Many individuals with insomnia have a history of “light” or easily\ndisturbed sleep prior to onset of more persistent sleep problems.\nInsomnia complaints are more prevalent among middle-age and older adults. The type\nof insomnia symptom changes as a function of age, with difficulties initiating sleep being\nmore common among young adults and problems maintaining sleep occurring more fre-\nquently among middle-age and older individuals.\nDifficulties initiating and maintaining sleep can also occur in children and adolescents,\nbut there are more limited data on prevalence, risk factors, and comorbidity during these\ndevelopmental phases of the lifespan. Sleep difficulties in childhood can result from con-\nditioning factors (e.g., a child who does not learn to fall asleep or return to sleep without\nthe presence of a parent) or from the absence of consistent sleep schedules and bedtime\nroutines. Insomnia in adolescence is often triggered or exacerbated by irregular sleep sched-\nules (e.g., phase delay). In both children and adolescents, psychological and medical fac-\ntors can contribute to insomnia.\nThe increased prevalence of insomnia in older adults is partly explained by the higher\nincidence of physical health problems with aging. Changes in sleep patterns associated with\nthe normal developmental process must be differentiated from those exceeding age-related\nchanges. Although polysomnography is of limited value in the routine evaluation of in-\nsomnia, it may be more useful in the differential diagnosis among older adults because the\netiologies of insomnia (e.g., sleep apnea) are more often identifiable in older individuals.\n366\nSleep-Wake Disorders", "risk_factors": "While the risk and prognostic factors discussed in this section increase vulnerability to in-\nsomnia, sleep disturbances are more likely to occur when predisposed individuals are ex-\nposed to precipitating events, such as major life events (e.g., illness, separation) or less\nsevere but more chronic daily stress. Most individuals resume normal sleep patterns after\nthe initial triggering event has disappeared, but others—perhaps those more vulnerable to\ninsomnia—continue experiencing persistent sleep difficulties. Perpetuating factors such as\npoor sleep habits, irregular sleep scheduling, and the fear of not sleeping feed into the in-\nsomnia problem and may contribute to a vicious cycle that may induce persistent insomnia.\nTemperamental.\nAnxiety or worry-prone personality or cognitive styles, increased arousal\npredisposition, and tendency to repress emotions can increase vulnerability to insomnia.\nEnvironmental.\nNoise, light, uncomfortably high or low temperature, and high altitude\nmay also increase vulnerability to insomnia.\nGenetic and physiological.\nFemale gender and advancing age are associated with in-\ncreased vulnerability to insomnia. Disrupted sleep and insomnia display a familial dispo-\nsition. The prevalence of insomnia is higher among monozygotic twins relative to\ndizygotic twins; it is also higher in first-degree family members compared with the general\npopulation. The extent to which this link is inherited through a genetic predisposition,\nlearned by observations of parental models, or established as a by-product of another psy-\nchopathology remains undetermined.\nCourse modifiers.\nDeleterious course modifiers include poor sleep hygiene practices\n(e.g., excessive caffeine use, irregular sleep schedules).", "cultural_issues": "", "gender_issues": "Insomnia is a more prevalent complaint among females than among males, with first onset\noften associated with the birth of a new child or with menopause. Despite higher preva-\nlence among older females, polysomnographic studies suggest better preservation of\nsleep continuity and slow-wave sleep in older females than in older males.", "diagnostic_markers": "Polysomnography usually shows impairments of sleep continuity (e.g., increased sleep la-\ntency and time awake after sleep onset and decreased sleep efficiency [percentage of time\nin bed asleep] and may show increased stage 1 sleep and decreased stages 3 and 4 sleep.\nThe severity of these sleep impairments does not always match the individual’s clinical\npresentation or subjective complaint of poor sleep, as individuals with insomnia often un-\nderestimate sleep duration and overestimate wakefulness relative to polysomnography.\nQuantitative electroencephalographic analyses may indicate that individuals with insom-\nnia have greater high-frequency electroencephalography power relative to good sleepers\nboth around the sleep onset period and during non–rapid eye movement sleep, a feature\nsuggestive of increased cortical arousal. Individuals with insomnia disorder may have a\nlower sleep propensity and typically do not show increased daytime sleepiness on objec-\ntive sleep laboratory measures compared with individuals without sleep disorders.\nOther laboratory measures show evidence, although not consistently, of increased\narousal and a generalized activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (e.g., in-\ncreased cortisol levels, heart rate variability, reactivity to stress, metabolic rate). In general,\nfindings are consistent with the hypothesis that increased physiological and cognitive\narousal plays a significant role in insomnia disorder.\nIndividuals with insomnia disorder may appear either fatigued or haggard or, con-\nversely, overaroused and “wired.” However, there are no consistent or characteristic\nabnormalities on physical examination.

De-\ncreased attention and concentration are common and may be related to higher rates of ac-\ncidents observed in insomnia. Persistent insomnia is also associated with long-term\nconsequences, including increased risks of major depressive disorder, hypertension, and\nmyocardial infarction; increased absenteeism and reduced productivity at work; reduced\nquality of life; and increased economic burden.", "differential_diagnosis": "Normal sleep variations.\nNormal sleep duration varies considerably across individuals.\nSome individuals who require little sleep (“short sleepers”) may be concerned about their\nsleep duration. Short sleepers differ from individuals with insomnia disorder by the lack of\ndifficulty falling or staying asleep and by the absence of characteristic daytime symptoms\n(e.g., fatigue, concentration problems, irritability). However, some short sleepers may desire\nor attempt to sleep for a longer period of time and, by prolonging time in bed, may create an\ninsomnia-like sleep pattern. Clinical insomnia also should be distinguished from normal,\nage-related sleep changes. Insomnia must also be distinguished from sleep deprivation due\nto inadequate opportunity or circumstance for sleep resulting, for example, from an emer-\ngency or from professional or family obligations forcing the individual to stay awake.\nSituational/acute insomnia.\nSituational/acute insomnia is a condition lasting a few days\nto a few weeks, often associated with life events or with changes in sleep schedules. These\nacute or short-term insomnia symptoms may also produce significant distress and inter-\nfere with social, personal, and occupational functioning. When such symptoms are fre-\nquent enough and meet all other criteria except for the 3-month duration, a diagnosis of\nother specified insomnia disorder or unspecified insomnia disorder is made.\nDelayed sleep phase and shift work types of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder.\nIndividuals with the delayed sleep phase type of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder re-\nport sleep-onset insomnia only when they try to sleep at socially normal times, but they do\nnot report difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep when their bed and rising times are\ndelayed and coincide with their endogenous circadian rhythm. Shift work type differs from\ninsomnia disorder by the history of recent shift work.\nRestless legs syndrome.\nRestless legs syndrome often produces difficulties initiating\nand maintaining sleep. However, an urge to move the legs and any accompanying unpleas-\nant leg sensations are features that differentiate this disorder from insomnia disorder.\nBreathing-related sleep disorders.\nMost individuals with a breathing-related sleep dis-\norder have a history of loud snoring, breathing pauses during sleep, and excessive daytime\nsleepiness. Nonetheless, as many as 50% of individuals with sleep apnea may also report\ninsomnia symptoms, a feature that is more common among females and older adults.\nNarcolepsy.\nNarcolepsy may cause insomnia complaints but is distinguished from in-\nsomnia disorder by the predominance of symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, cat-\naplexy, sleep paralysis, and sleep-related hallucinations.\nParasomnias.\nParasomnias are characterized by a complaint of unusual behavior or events\nduring sleep that may lead to intermittent awakenings and difficulty resuming sleep.\nHowever, it is these behavioral events, rather than the insomnia per se, that dominate the\nclinical picture.\n368\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nSubstance/medication-induced sleep disorder, insomnia type.\nSubstance/medication-\ninduced sleep disorder, insomnia type, is distinguished from insomnia disorder by the fact\nthat a substance (i.e., a drug of abuse, a medication, or exposure to a toxin) is judged to be\netiologically related to the insomnia (see “Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disor-\nder” later in this chapter). For example, insomnia occurring only in the context of heavy\ncoffee consumption would be diagnosed as caffeine-induced sleep disorder, insomnia\ntype, with onset during intoxication.", "comorbidity": "Insomnia is a common comorbidity of many medical conditions, including diabetes, cor-\nonary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arthritis, fibromyalgia, and\nother chronic pain conditions. The risk relationship appears to be bidirectional: insomnia\nincreases the risk of medical conditions, and medical problems increase the risk of insom-\nnia. The direction of the relationship is not always clear and may change over time; for this\nreason, comorbid insomnia is the preferred terminology in the presence of coexisting in-\nsomnia with another medical condition (or mental disorder).\nIndividuals with insomnia disorder frequently have a comorbid mental disorder, par-\nticularly bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders. Persistent insomnia represents a risk\nfactor or an early symptom of subsequent bipolar, depressive, anxiety, and substance use\ndisorders. Individuals with insomnia may misuse medications or alcohol to help with\nnighttime sleep, anxiolytics to combat tension or anxiety, and caffeine or other stimulants\nto combat excessive fatigue. In addition to worsening the insomnia, this type of substance\nuse may in some cases progress to a substance use disorder.\nRelationship to International Classification of\nSleep Disorders\nThere are several distinct insomnia phenotypes relating to the perceived source of the in-\nsomnia that are recognized by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition\n(ICSD-2).

Symptoms are\nworse when the individual is at rest, and frequent movements of the legs occur in an effort\nto relieve the uncomfortable sensations. Symptoms are worse in the evening or night, and\nin some individuals they occur only in the evening or night. Evening worsening occurs in-\ndependently of any differences in activity. It is important to differentiate RLS from other\nconditions such as positional discomfort and leg cramps (Criterion D).\nThe symptoms of RLS can delay sleep onset and awaken the individual from sleep and\nare associated with significant sleep fragmentation.

Compared with nonfamilial\ncases, familial RLS usually has a younger age at onset and a slower progressive course. The\nclinical course of RLS differs by age at onset. When onset occurs before age 45, there is of-\nten a slow progression of symptoms. In late-onset RLS, rapid progression is typical, and\naggravating factors are common. Symptoms of RLS appear similar across the lifespan, re-\nmaining stable or decreasing slightly in older age groups.\nDiagnosis of RLS in children can be difficult because of the self-report component.\nWhile Criterion A for adults assumes that the description of “urge to move” is by the pa-\ntient, pediatric diagnosis requires a description in the child’s own words rather than by a\nparent or caretaker. Typically children age 6 years or older are able to provide detailed, ad-\nequate descriptors of RLS. However, children rarely use or understand the word “urge,”\nreporting instead that their legs “have to” or “got to” move.

Precipitating factors are often time-\nlimited, such as iron deficiency, with most individuals resuming normal sleep patterns\nafter the initial triggering event has disappeared. Genetic risk variants also play a role in\nRLS secondary to such disorders as uremia, suggesting that individuals with a genetic sus-\nceptibility develop RLS in the presence of further risk factors. RLS has a strong familial\ncomponent.\nThere are defined pathophysiological pathways subserving RLS. Genome-wide asso-\nciation studies have found that RLS is significantly associated with common genetic vari-\nants in intronic or intergenic regions in MEIS1, BTBD9, and MAP2K5 on chromosomes 2p,\n6p, and 15q, respectively. The association of these three variants with RLS has been inde-\npendently replicated. BTBD9 confers a very large (80%) excessive risk when even a single\nallele is present. Because of the high frequency of this variant in individuals of European\ndescent, the population attributable risk (PAR) approximates 50%. At-risk alleles associ-\nated with MEIS1 and BTBD9 are less common in individuals of African or Asian descent,\nperhaps suggesting lower risk for RLS in these populations.\nPathophysiological mechanisms in RLS also include disturbances in the central dopa-\nminergic system and disturbances in iron metabolism. The endogenous opiate system\nmay also be involved. Treatment effects of dopaminergic drugs (primarily D2 and D3 non-\nergot agonists) provide further support that RLS is grounded in dysfunctional central\ndopaminergic pathways.

Even when there is\nevidence to the contrary, some patients still fear the medical seriousness of their symp-\ntoms. In severe somatic symptom disorder, health concerns may assume a central role in\nthe individual’s life, becoming a feature of his or her identity and dominating interper-\nsonal relationships.\n312\nSomatic Symptom and Related Disorders\nIndividuals typically experience distress that is principally focused on somatic symp-\ntoms and their significance. When asked directly about their distress, some individuals de-\nscribe it in relation to other aspects of their lives, while others deny any source of distress\nother than the somatic symptoms. Health-related quality of life is often impaired, both\nphysically and mentally. In severe somatic symptom disorder, the impairment is marked,\nand when persistent, the disorder can lead to invalidism.\nThere is often a high level of medical care utilization, which rarely alleviates the individ-\nual’s concerns. Consequently, the patient may seek care from multiple doctors for the same\nsymptoms. These individuals often seem unresponsive to medical interventions, and new\ninterventions may only exacerbate the presenting symptoms. Some individuals with the dis-\norder seem unusually sensitive to medication side effects. Some feel that their medical as-\nsessment and treatment have been inadequate.", "associated_features": "Cognitive features include attention focused on somatic symptoms, attribution of normal\nbodily sensations to physical illness (possibly with catastrophic interpretations), worry\nabout illness, and fear that any physical activity may damage the body. The relevant as-\nsociated behavioral features may include repeated bodily checking for abnormalities, re-\npeated seeking of medical help and reassurance, and avoidance of physical activity. These\nbehavioral features are most pronounced in severe, persistent somatic symptom disorder.\nThese features are usually associated with frequent requests for medical help for different\nsomatic symptoms. This may lead to medical consultations in which individuals are so fo-\ncused on their concerns about somatic symptom(s) that they cannot be redirected to other\nmatters. Any reassurance by the doctor that the symptoms are not indicative of serious\nphysical illness tends to be short-lived and/or is experienced by the individuals as the\ndoctor not taking their symptoms with due seriousness. As the focus on somatic symp-\ntoms is a primary feature of the disorder, individuals with somatic symptom disorder typ-\nically present to general medical health services rather than mental health services. The\nsuggestion of referral to a mental health specialist may be met with surprise or even frank\nrefusal by individuals with somatic symptom disorder.\nSince somatic symptom disorder is associated with depressive disorders, there is an in-\ncreased suicide risk.

However, the prevalence of\nsomatic symptom disorder is expected to be higher than that of the more restrictive DSM-\nIV somatization disorder (<1%) but lower than that of undifferentiated somatoform dis-\norder (approximately 19%). The prevalence of somatic symptom disorder in the general\nadult population may be around 5%–7%. Females tend to report more somatic symptoms\nthan do males, and the prevalence of somatic symptom disorder is consequently likely to\nbe higher in females.", "development_course": "In older individuals, somatic symptoms and concurrent medical illnesses are common,\nand a focus on Criterion B is crucial for making the diagnosis. Somatic symptom disorder\nmay be underdiagnosed in older adults either because certain somatic symptoms (e.g.,\npain, fatigue) are considered part of normal aging or because illness worry is considered\n“understandable” in older adults who have more general medical illnesses and medica-\ntions than do younger people. Concurrent depressive disorder is common in older people\nwho present with numerous somatic symptoms.\nSomatic Symptom Disorder\n313\nIn children, the most common symptoms are recurrent abdominal pain, headache, fa-\ntigue, and nausea. A single prominent symptom is more common in children than in\nadults. While young children may have somatic complaints, they rarely worry about “ill-\nness” per se prior to adolescence.

The relationship between nu-\nmerous somatic symptoms and depression appears to be very similar around the world\nand between different cultures within one country.\nDespite these similarities, there are differences in somatic symptoms among cultures\nand ethnic groups. The description of somatic symptoms varies with linguistic and other\nlocal cultural factors. These somatic presentations have been described as “idioms of dis-\ntress” because somatic symptoms may have special meanings and shape patient-clinician\ninteractions in the particular cultural contexts. “Burnout,” the sensation of heaviness or\nthe complaints of “gas”; too much heat in the body; or burning in the head are examples of\nsymptoms that are common in some cultures or ethnic groups but rare in others. Explan-\natory models also vary, and somatic symptoms may be attributed variously to particular\nfamily, work, or environmental stresses; general medical illness; the suppression of feel-\nings of anger and resentment; or certain culture-specific phenomena, such as semen loss.\nThere may also be differences in medical treatment seeking among cultural groups, in ad-\ndition to differences due to variable access to medical care services.

Somatic symptoms are not present or, if\npresent, are only mild in intensity (Criterion B). A thorough evaluation fails to identify a\nserious medical condition that accounts for the individual’s concerns. While the concern\nmay be derived from a nonpathological physical sign or sensation, the individual’s dis-\ntress emanates not primarily from the physical complaint itself but rather from his or her\nanxiety about the meaning, significance, or cause of the complaint (i.e., the suspected med-\nical diagnosis). If a physical sign or symptom is present, it is often a normal physiological\nsensation (e.g., orthostatic dizziness), a benign and self-limited dysfunction (e.g., transient\ntinnitus), or a bodily discomfort not generally considered indicative of disease (e.g., belch-\ning). If a diagnosable medical condition is present, the individual’s anxiety and preoccu-\npation are clearly excessive and disproportionate to the severity of the condition (Criterion\nB).

Reflecting the\nrelatively fast metabolism of alcohol, symptoms of alcohol withdrawal usually peak in inten-\nsity during the second day of abstinence and are likely to improve markedly by the fourth or\nfifth day.

For alcohol\nintoxication delirium and alcohol withdrawal delirium, see the criteria and discussion of de-\nlirium in the chapter “Neurocognitive Disorders.” These alcohol-induced disorders are diag-\nnosed instead of alcohol intoxication or alcohol withdrawal only when the symptoms are\nsufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.\nFeatures\nThe symptom profiles for an alcohol-induced condition resemble independent mental disor-\nders as described elsewhere in DSM-5. However, the alcohol-induced disorder is temporary\nand observed after severe intoxication with and/or withdrawal from alcohol. While the symp-\ntoms can be identical to those of independent mental disorders (e.g., psychoses, major depres-\nsive disorder), and while they can have the same severe consequences (e.g., suicide attempts),\nalcohol-induced conditions are likely to improve without formal treatment in a matter of days\nto weeks after cessation of severe intoxication and/or withdrawal.\nEach alcohol-induced mental disorder is listed in the relevant diagnostic section and there-\nfore only a brief description is offered here. Alcohol-induced disorders must have developed\nin the context of severe intoxication and/or withdrawal from the substance capable of produc-\ning the mental disorder. In addition, there must be evidence that the disorder being observed\nis not likely to be better explained by another non-alcohol-induced mental disorder. The latter\nis likely to occur if the mental disorder was present before the severe intoxication or with-\ndrawal, or continued more than 1 month after the cessation of severe intoxication and/or with-\ndrawal. When symptoms are observed only during a delirium, they should be considered part\nof the delirium and not diagnosed separately, as many symptoms (including disturbances in\nmood, anxiety, and reality testing) are commonly seen during agitated, confused states. The al-\ncohol-induced disorder must be clinically relevant, causing significant levels of distress or sig-\nnificant functional impairment. Finally, there are indications that the intake of substances of\nabuse in the context of a preexisting mental disorder are likely to result in an intensification of\nthe preexisting independent syndrome.\nThe features associated with each relevant major mental disorder (e.g., psychotic epi-\nsodes, major depressive disorder) are similar whether observed with an independent or an\nalcohol-induced condition. However, individuals with alcohol-induced disorders are\nlikely to also demonstrate the associated features seen with an alcohol use disorder, as\nlisted in the subsections of this chapter.\nRates of alcohol-induced disorders vary somewhat by diagnostic category. For exam-\nple, the lifetime risk for major depressive episodes in individuals with alcohol use disorder\nis approximately 40%, but only about one-third to one-half of these represent independent\nmajor depressive syndromes observed outside the context of intoxication. Similar rates of\nalcohol-induced sleep and anxiety conditions are likely, but alcohol-induced psychotic ep-\nisodes are fairly rare."}, "provenance": {"source_file": "substance_related_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 4, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.594326"}}

Over time, this plant material has accumulated many names (e.g.,\nweed, pot, herb, grass, reefer, mary jane, dagga, dope, bhang, skunk, boom, gangster, kif,\nand ganja). A concentrated extraction of the cannabis plant that is also commonly used is\nhashish. Cannabis is the generic and perhaps the most appropriate scientific term for the\npsychoactive substance(s) derived from the plant, and as such it is used in this manual\nto refer to all forms of cannabis-like substances, including synthetic cannabinoid com-\npounds.\nCannabis Use Disorder\n511\nSynthetic oral formulations (pill/capsules) of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-\nTHC) are available by prescription for a number of approved medical indications (e.g., for\nnausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy; for anorexia and weight loss in individuals\nwith AIDS). Other synthetic cannabinoid compounds have been manufactured and dis-\ntributed for nonmedical use in the form of plant material that has been sprayed with a can-\nnabinoid formulation (e.g., K2, Spice, JWH-018, JWH-073).\nThe cannabinoids have diverse effects in the brain, prominent among which are actions\non CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the central nervous sys-\ntem. Endogenous ligands for these receptors behave essentially like neurotransmitters.\nThe potency of cannabis (delta-9-THC concentration) that is generally available varies\ngreatly, ranging from 1% to approximately 15% in typical cannabis plant material and\n10%–20% in hashish. During the past two decades, a steady increase in the potency of\nseized cannabis has been observed.\nCannabis is most commonly smoked via a variety of methods: pipes, water pipes\n(bongs or hookahs), cigarettes (joints or reefers), or, most recently, in the paper from hol-\nlowed out cigars (blunts). Cannabis is also sometimes ingested orally, typically by mixing\nit into food. More recently, devices have been developed in which cannabis is “vapor-\nized.” Vaporization involves heating the plant material to release psychoactive cannabi-\nnoids for inhalation. As with other psychoactive substances, smoking (and vaporization)\ntypically produces more rapid onset and more intense experiences of the desired effects.\nIndividuals who regularly use cannabis can develop all the general diagnostic features\nof a substance use disorder. Cannabis use disorder is commonly observed as the only sub-\nstance use disorder experienced by the individual; however, it also frequently occurs con-\ncurrently with other types of substance use disorders (i.e., alcohol, cocaine, opioid). In\ncases for which multiple types of substances are used, many times the individual may\nminimize the symptoms related to cannabis, as the symptoms may be less severe or cause\nless harm than those directly related to the use of the other substances. Pharmacological\nand behavioral tolerance to most of the effects of cannabis has been reported in individuals\nwho use cannabis persistently. Generally, tolerance is lost when cannabis use is discontin-\nued for a significant period of time (i.e., for at least several months).\nNew to DSM-5 is the recognition that abrupt cessation of daily or near-daily cannabis\nuse often results in the onset of a cannabis withdrawal syndrome. Common symptoms of\nwithdrawal include irritability, anger or aggression, anxiety, depressed mood, restless-\nness, sleep difficulty, and decreased appetite or weight loss. Although typically not as\nsevere as alcohol or opiate withdrawal, the cannabis withdrawal syndrome can cause sig-\nnificant distress and contribute to difficulty quitting or relapse among those trying to\nabstain.\nIndividuals with cannabis use disorder may use cannabis throughout the day over a\nperiod of months or years, and thus may spend many hours a day under the influence.\nOthers may use less frequently, but their use causes recurrent problems related to family,\nschool, work, or other important activities (e.g., repeated absences at work; neglect of fam-\nily obligations). Periodic cannabis use and intoxication can negatively affect behavioral\nand cognitive functioning and thus interfere with optimal performance at work or school,\nor place the individual at increased physical risk when performing activities that could be\nphysically hazardous (e.g., driving a car; playing certain sports; performing manual work\nactivities, including operating machinery). Arguments with spouses or parents over the\nuse of cannabis in the home, or its use in the presence of children, can adversely impact\nfamily functioning and are common features of those with cannabis use disorder. Last, in-\ndividuals with cannabis use disorder may continue using despite knowledge of physical\nproblems (e.g., chronic cough related to smoking) or psychological problems (e.g., exces-\nsive sedation or exacerbation of other mental health problems) associated with its use.\nWhether or not cannabis is being used for legitimate medical reasons may also affect\ndiagnosis. When a substance is taken as indicated for a medical condition, symptoms of\n512\nSubstance-Related and Addictive Disorders\ntolerance and withdrawal will naturally occur and should not be used as the primary cri-\nteria for determining a diagnosis of a substance use disorder. Although medical uses of\ncannabis remain controversial and equivocal, use for medical circumstances should be\nconsidered when a diagnosis is being made.", "associated_features": "Individuals who regularly use cannabis often report that it is being used to cope with\nmood, sleep, pain, or other physiological or psychological problems, and those diagnosed\nwith cannabis use disorder frequently do have concurrent other mental disorders. Careful\nassessment typically reveals reports of cannabis use contributing to exacerbation of these\nsame symptoms, as well as other reasons for frequent use (e.g., to experience euphoria, to\nforget about problems, in response to anger, as an enjoyable social activity). Related to this\nissue, some individuals who use cannabis multiple times per day for the aforementioned\nreasons do not perceive themselves as (and thus do not report) spending an excessive\namount of time under the influence or recovering from the effects of cannabis, despite be-\ning intoxicated on cannabis or coming down from it effects for the majority of most days.\nAn important marker of a substance use disorder diagnosis, particularly in milder cases, is\ncontinued use despite a clear risk of negative consequences to other valued activities or re-\nlationships (e.g., school, work, sport activity, partner or parent relationship).\nBecause some cannabis users are motivated to minimize their amount or frequency of\nuse, it is important to be aware of common signs and symptoms of cannabis use and intox-\nication so as to better assess the extent of use. As with other substances, experienced users\nof cannabis develop behavioral and pharmacological tolerance such that it can be difficult\nto detect when they are under the influence. Signs of acute and chronic use include red eyes\n(conjunctival injection), cannabis odor on clothing, yellowing of finger tips (from smoking\njoints), chronic cough, burning of incense (to hide the odor), and exaggerated craving and\nimpulse for specific foods, sometimes at unusual times of the day or night.", "prevalence": "Cannabinoids, especially cannabis, are the most widely used illicit psychoactive sub-\nstances in the United States. The 12-month prevalence of cannabis use disorder (DSM-IV\nabuse and dependence rates combined) is approximately 3.4% among 12- to 17-year-olds\nand 1.5% among adults age 18 years and older. Rates of cannabis use disorder are greater\namong adult males (2.2%) than among adult females (0.8%) and among 12- to 17-year-old\nmales (3.8%) than among 12- to 17-year-old females (3.0%). Twelve-month prevalence\nrates of cannabis use disorder among adults decrease with age, with rates highest among\n18- to 29-year-olds (4.4%) and lowest among individuals age 65 years and older (0.01%).\nThe high prevalence of cannabis use disorder likely reflects the much more widespread\nuse of cannabis relative to other illicit drugs rather than greater addictive potential.\nEthnic and racial differences in prevalence are moderate. Twelve-month prevalences\nof cannabis use disorder vary markedly across racial-ethnic subgroups in the United\nStates. For 12- to 17-year-olds, rates are highest among Native American and Alaska Na-\ntives (7.1%) compared with Hispanics (4.1%), whites (3.4%), African Americans (2.7%),\nand Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (0.9%). Among adults, the prevalence of can-\nnabis use disorder is also highest among Native Americans and Alaska Natives (3.4%) rel-\native to rates among African Americans (1.8%), whites (1.4%), Hispanics (1.2%), and Asian\nand Pacific Islanders (1.2%). During the past decade the prevalence of cannabis use disor-\nder has increased among adults and adolescents. Gender differences in cannabis use dis-\norder generally are concordant with those in other substance use disorders. Cannabis use\ndisorder is more commonly observed in males, although the magnitude of this difference\nis less among adolescents.\nCannabis Use Disorder\n513", "development_course": "The onset of cannabis use disorder can occur at any time during or following adolescence,\nbut onset is most commonly during adolescence or young adulthood. Although much less\nfrequent, onset of cannabis use disorder in the preteen years or in the late 20s or older can\noccur. Recent acceptance by some of the use and availability of “medical marijuana” may\nincrease the rate of onset of cannabis use disorder among older adults.\nGenerally, cannabis use disorder develops over an extended period of time, although\nthe progression appears to be more rapid in adolescents, particularly those with pervasive\nconduct problems. Most people who develop a cannabis use disorder typically establish a\npattern of cannabis use that gradually increases in both frequency and amount. Cannabis,\nalong with tobacco and alcohol, is traditionally the first substance that adolescents try.\nMany perceive cannabis use as less harmful than alcohol or tobacco use, and this percep-\ntion likely contributes to increased use. Moreover, cannabis intoxication does not typically\nresult in as severe behavioral and cognitive dysfunction as does significant alcohol intox-\nication, which may increase the probability of more frequent use in more diverse situa-\ntions than with alcohol. These factors likely contribute to the potential rapid transition\nfrom cannabis use to a cannabis use disorder among some adolescents and the common\npattern of using throughout the day that is commonly observed among those with more\nsevere cannabis use disorder.\nCannabis use disorder among preteens, adolescents, and young adults is typically ex-\npressed as excessive use with peers that is a component of a pattern of other delinquent\nbehaviors usually associated with conduct problems. Milder cases primarily reflect con-\ntinued use despite clear problems related to disapproval of use by other peers, school ad-\nministration, or family, which also places the youth at risk for physical or behavioral\nconsequences. In more severe cases, there is a progression to using alone or using through-\nout the day such that use interferes with daily functioning and takes the place of previ-\nously established, prosocial activities.\nWith adolescent users, changes in mood stability, energy level, and eating patterns are\ncommonly observed. These signs and symptoms are likely due to the direct effects of can-\nnabis use (intoxication) and the subsequent effects following acute intoxication (coming\ndown), as well as attempts to conceal use from others. School-related problems are com-\nmonly associated with cannabis use disorder in adolescents, particularly a dramatic drop\nin grades, truancy, and reduced interest in general school activities and outcomes.\nCannabis use disorder among adults typically involves well-established patterns of daily\ncannabis use that continue despite clear psychosocial or medical problems. Many adults have\nexperienced repeated desire to stop or have failed at repeated cessation attempts. Milder adult\ncases may resemble the more common adolescent cases in that cannabis use is not as frequent\nor heavy but continues despite potential significant consequences of sustained use. The rate of\nuse among middle-age and older adults appears to be increasing, likely because of a cohort ef-\nfect resulting from high prevalence of use in the late 1960s and the 1970s.\nEarly onset of cannabis use (e.g., prior to age 15 years) is a robust predictor of the de-\nvelopment of cannabis use disorder and other types of substance use disorders and mental\ndisorders during young adulthood. Such early onset is likely related to concurrent other\nexternalizing problems, most notably conduct disorder symptoms. However, early onset\nis also a predictor of internalizing problems and as such probably reflects a general risk\nfactor for the development of mental health disorders.", "risk_factors": "Temperamental.\nA history of conduct disorder in childhood or adolescence and antiso-\ncial personality disorder are risk factors for the development of many substance-related\ndisorders, including cannabis-related disorders. Other risk factors include externalizing\n514\nSubstance-Related and Addictive Disorders\nor internalizing disorders during childhood or adolescence. Youths with high behavioral\ndisinhibition scores show early-onset substance use disorders, including cannabis use dis-\norder, multiple substance involvement, and early conduct problems.\nEnvironmental.\nRisk factors include academic failure, tobacco smoking, unstable or abu-\nsive family situation, use of cannabis among immediate family members, a family history\nof a substance use disorder, and low socioeconomic status. As with all substances of abuse,\nthe ease of availability of the substance is a risk factor; cannabis is relatively easy to obtain\nin most cultures, which increases the risk of developing a cannabis use disorder.\nGenetic and physiological.\nGenetic influences contribute to the development of canna-\nbis use disorders. Heritable factors contribute between 30% and 80% of the total variance\nin risk of cannabis use disorders.

Occurrence of\ncannabis use disorder across countries is unknown, but the prevalence rates are likely sim-\nilar among developed countries. It is frequently among the first drugs of experimentation\n(often in the teens) of all cultural groups in the United States.\nAcceptance of cannabis for medical purposes varies widely across and within cultures.\nCultural factors (acceptability and legal status) that might impact diagnosis relate to dif-\nferential consequences across cultures for detection of use (i.e., arrest, school suspensions,\nor employment suspension). The general change in substance use disorder diagnostic cri-\nteria from DSM-IV to DSM-5 (i.e., removal of the recurrent substance-related legal prob-\nlems criterion) mitigates this concern to some degree.", "gender_issues": "", "diagnostic_markers": "Biological tests for cannabinoid metabolites are useful for determining if an individual has\nrecently used cannabis. Such testing is helpful in making a diagnosis, particularly in\nmilder cases if an individual denies using while others (family, work, school) purport con-\ncern about a substance use problem.

Cognitive function, particularly higher executive function, ap-\npears to be compromised in cannabis users, and this relationship appears to be dose de-\npendent (both acutely and chronically).

Cannabis use has been related to a reduction in prosocial goal-directed ac-\ntivity, which some have labeled an amotivational syndrome, that manifests itself in poor\nschool performance and employment problems. These problems may be related to perva-\nsive intoxication or recovery from the effects of intoxication. Similarly, cannabis-associated\nproblems with social relationships are commonly reported in those with cannabis use dis-\norder. Accidents due to engagement in potentially dangerous behaviors while under the\ninfluence (e.g., driving, sport, recreational or employment activities) are also of concern.\nCannabis smoke contains high levels of carcinogenic compounds that place chronic users\nat risk for respiratory illnesses similar to those experienced by tobacco smokers.

Can-\nnabis use and cannabis use disorder are highly comorbid with other substance use disor-\nders. Co-occurring mental conditions are common in cannabis use disorder. Cannabis use\nhas been associated with poorer life satisfaction; increased mental health treatment and\nhospitalization; and higher rates of depression, anxiety disorders, suicide attempts, and\nconduct disorder. Individuals with past-year or lifetime cannabis use disorder have high\nrates of alcohol use disorder (greater than 50%) and tobacco use disorder (53%). Rates of\nother substance use disorders are also likely to be high among individuals with cannabis\nuse disorder. Among those seeking treatment for a cannabis use disorder, 74% report\nproblematic use of a secondary or tertiary substance: alcohol (40%), cocaine (12%), meth-\namphetamine (6%), and heroin or other opiates (2%). Among those younger than 18 years,\n61% reported problematic use of a secondary substance: alcohol (48%), cocaine (4%), meth-\namphetamine (2%), and heroin or other opiates (2%). Cannabis use disorder is also often\nobserved as a secondary problem among those with a primary diagnosis of other substance\nuse disorders, with approximately 25%–80% of those in treatment for another substance\nuse disorder reporting use of cannabis.\nIndividuals with past-year or lifetime diagnoses of cannabis use disorder also have\nhigh rates of concurrent mental disorders other than substance use disorders. Major de-\npressive disorder (11%), any anxiety disorder (24%), and bipolar I disorder (13%) are quite\ncommon among individuals with a past-year diagnosis of a cannabis use disorder, as are\nantisocial (30%), obsessive-compulsive, (19%), and paranoid (18%) personality disorders.\nApproximately 33% of adolescents with cannabis use disorder have internalizing disor-\nders (e.g., anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder), and 60% have externalizing\ndisorders (e.g., conduct disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder).\nAlthough cannabis use can impact multiple aspects of normal human functioning, in-\ncluding the cardiovascular, immune, neuromuscular, ocular, reproductive, and respira-\ntory systems, as well as appetite and cognition/perception, there are few clear medical\nconditions that commonly co-occur with cannabis use disorder.

(For example, an indi-\nvidual prescribed analgesic opioids for pain relief at adequate dosing will use significantly\nmore than prescribed and not only because of persistent pain.) Individuals with opioid use\ndisorder tend to develop such regular patterns of compulsive drug use that daily activities\nare planned around obtaining and administering opioids. Opioids are usually purchased\non the illegal market but may also be obtained from physicians by falsifying or exagger-\nating general medical problems or by receiving simultaneous prescriptions from several\nphysicians. Health care professionals with opioid use disorder will often obtain opioids by\nwriting prescriptions for themselves or by diverting opioids that have been prescribed for\npatients or from pharmacy supplies. Most individuals with opioid use disorder have\nsignificant levels of tolerance and will experience withdrawal on abrupt discontinuation\nof opioid substances. Individuals with opioid use disorder often develop conditioned\nresponses to drug-related stimuli (e.g., craving on seeing any heroin powder–like sub-\nstance)—a phenomenon that occurs with most drugs that cause intense psychological\nchanges.

However, the incidence may also be 10% or\nless in other areas, especially those where access to clean injection material and parapher-\nnalia is facilitated.\nTuberculosis is a particularly serious problem among individuals who use drugs in-\ntravenously, especially those who are dependent on heroin; infection is usually asymptom-\natic and evident only by the presence of a positive tuberculin skin test. However, many cases\nof active tuberculosis have been found, especially among those who are infected with HIV.\nThese individuals often have a newly acquired infection but also are likely to experience\nreactivation of a prior infection because of impaired immune function.\nIndividuals who sniff heroin or other opioids into the nose (“snorting”) often develop\nirritation of the nasal mucosa, sometimes accompanied by perforation of the nasal septum.\nDifficulties in sexual functioning are common. Males often experience erectile dysfunction\nduring intoxication or chronic use. Females commonly have disturbances of reproductive\nfunction and irregular menses.\nIn relation to infections such as cellulitis, hepatitis, HIV infection, tuberculosis, and en-\ndocarditis, opioid use disorder is associated with a mortality rate as high as 1.5%–2% per\nyear. Death most often results from overdose, accidents, injuries, AIDS, or other general\nmedical complications. Accidents and injuries due to violence that is associated with buy-\ning or selling drugs are common. In some areas, violence accounts for more opioid-related\ndeaths than overdose or HIV infection. Physiological dependence on opioids may occur in\nabout half of the infants born to females with opioid use disorder; this can produce a se-\nvere withdrawal syndrome requiring medical treatment.

Once opioid use disorder\ndevelops, it usually continues over a period of many years, even though brief periods of\nabstinence are frequent. In treated populations, relapse following abstinence is common.\nEven though relapses do occur, and while some long-term mortality rates may be as high\nas 2% per year, about 20%–30% of individuals with opioid use disorder achieve long-term\nabstinence. An exception concerns that of military service personnel who became depen-\ndent on opioids in Vietnam; over 90% of this population who had been dependent on opi-\noids during deployment in Vietnam achieved abstinence after they returned, but they\nexperienced increased rates of alcohol or amphetamine use disorder as well as increased\nsuicidality.\nIncreasing age is associated with a decrease in prevalence as a result of early mortality\nand the remission of symptoms after age 40 years (i.e., “maturing out”). However, many\nindividuals continue have presentations that meet opioid use disorder criteria for decades.", "risk_factors": "Genetic and physiological.\nThe risk for opiate use disorder can be related to individual,\nfamily, peer, and social environmental factors, but within these domains, genetic factors\nplay a particularly important role both directly and indirectly.

Fentanyl\nis not detected by standard urine tests but can be identified by more specialized proce-\ndures for several days. Methadone, buprenorphine (or buprenorphine/naloxone combi-\nnation), and LAAM (L-alpha-acetylmethadol) have to be specifically tested for and will not\ncause a positive result on routine tests for opiates. They can be detected for several days up\nto more than 1 week. Laboratory evidence of the presence of other substances (e.g., co-\ncaine, marijuana, alcohol, amphetamines, benzodiazepines) is common. Screening test re-\nsults for hepatitis A, B, and C virus are positive in as many as 80%–90% of injection opioid\nusers, either for hepatitis antigen (signifying active infection) or for hepatitis antibody (sig-\nnifying past infection). HIV is prevalent in injection opioid users as well. Mildly elevated\nliver function test results are common, either as a result of resolving hepatitis or from toxic\ninjury to the liver due to contaminants that have been mixed with the injected opioid.

Particu-\nlarly notable are both accidental and deliberate opioid overdoses. Some suicide risk factors\noverlap with risk factors for an opioid use disorder. In addition, repeated opioid intoxica-\ntion or withdrawal may be associated with severe depressions that, although temporary,\ncan be intense enough to lead to suicide attempts and completed suicides. Available data\nsuggest that nonfatal accidental opioid overdose (which is common) and attempted sui-\ncide are distinct clinically significant problems that should not be mistaken for each other.", "functional_consequences": "Opioid use is associated with a lack of mucous membrane secretions, causing dry mouth\nand nose. Slowing of gastrointestinal activity and a decrease in gut motility can produce\nsevere constipation. Visual acuity may be impaired as a result of pupillary constriction\nwith acute administration. In individuals who inject opioids, sclerosed veins (“tracks”)\nand puncture marks on the lower portions of the upper extremities are common.

Opioid-induced disorders may be characterized by symptoms\n(e.g., depressed mood) that resemble primary mental disorders (e.g., persistent depressive dis-\norder [dysthymia] vs. opioid-induced depressive disorder, with depressive features, with on-\nset during intoxication). Opioids are less likely to produce symptoms of mental disturbance\nthan are most other drugs of abuse. Opioid intoxication and opioid withdrawal are distin-\nguished from the other opioid-induced disorders (e.g., opioid-induced depressive disorder,\nwith onset during intoxication) because the symptoms in these latter disorders predominate\nthe clinical presentation and are severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention.\nOther substance intoxication.\nAlcohol intoxication and sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic\nintoxication can cause a clinical picture that resembles that for opioid intoxication. A diag-\nnosis of alcohol or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication can usually be made based\non the absence of pupillary constriction or the lack of a response to naloxone challenge. In\nsome cases, intoxication may be due both to opioids and to alcohol or other sedatives. In\nthese cases, the naloxone challenge will not reverse all of the sedative effects.\nOther withdrawal disorders.\nThe anxiety and restlessness associated with opioid with-\ndrawal resemble symptoms seen in sedative-hypnotic withdrawal. However, opioid\nwithdrawal is also accompanied by rhinorrhea, lacrimation, and pupillary dilation, which\n546\nSubstance-Related and Addictive Disorders\nare not seen in sedative-type withdrawal.

These infections are less common in opioid use disorder with prescription opioids.\nOpioid use disorder is often associated with other substance use disorders, especially those\ninvolving tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, stimulants, and benzodiazepines, which are often\ntaken to reduce symptoms of opioid withdrawal or craving for opioids, or to enhance the ef-\nfects of administered opioids. Individuals with opioid use disorder are at risk for the devel-\nopment of mild to moderate depression that meets symptomatic and duration criteria for\npersistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) or, in some cases, for major depressive disorder.\nThese symptoms may represent an opioid-induced depressive disorder or an exacerbation\nof a preexisting primary depressive disorder. Periods of depression are especially common\nduring chronic intoxication or in association with physical or psychosocial stressors that are\nrelated to the opioid use disorder. Insomnia is common, especially during withdrawal. An-\ntisocial personality disorder is much more common in individuals with opioid use disorder\nthan in the general population.

Re-\ngardless of the route of administration, tolerance occurs with repeated use. Withdrawal\nsymptoms, particularly hypersomnia, increased appetite, and dysphoria, can occur and\ncan enhance craving. Most individuals with stimulant use disorder have experienced tol-\nerance or withdrawal.\nUse patterns and course are similar for disorders involving amphetamine-type stimu-\nlants and cocaine, as both substances are potent central nervous system stimulants with\nsimilar psychoactive and sympathomimetic effects. Amphetamine-type stimulants are\nlonger acting than cocaine and thus are used fewer times per day. Usage may be chronic or\nepisodic, with binges punctuated by brief non-use periods. Aggressive or violent behavior\nis common when high doses are smoked, ingested, or administered intravenously. Intense\ntemporary anxiety resembling panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder, as well as\nparanoid ideation and psychotic episodes that resemble schizophrenia, is seen with high-\ndose use.\nWithdrawal states are associated with temporary but intense depressive symptoms that\ncan resemble a major depressive episode; the depressive symptoms usually resolve within\n1 week.

In some individuals, fear-based re-\nexperiencing, emotional, and behavioral symptoms may predominate. In others, anhe-\ndonic or dysphoric mood states and negative cognitions may be most distressing. In some\nother individuals, arousal and reactive-externalizing symptoms are prominent, while in\nothers, dissociative symptoms predominate. Finally, some individuals exhibit combina-\ntions of these symptom patterns.\nThe directly experienced traumatic events in Criterion A include, but are not limited\nto, exposure to war as a combatant or civilian, threatened or actual physical assault (e.g.,\nphysical attack, robbery, mugging, childhood physical abuse), threatened or actual sexual\nviolence (e.g., forced sexual penetration, alcohol/drug-facilitated sexual penetration, abu-\nsive sexual contact, noncontact sexual abuse, sexual trafficking), being kidnapped, being\ntaken hostage, terrorist attack, torture, incarceration as a prisoner of war, natural or hu-\nman-made disasters, and severe motor vehicle accidents. For children, sexually violent\nevents may include developmentally inappropriate sexual experiences without physical\nviolence or injury. A life-threatening illness or debilitating medical condition is not neces-\nsarily considered a traumatic event. Medical incidents that qualify as traumatic events in-\nvolve sudden, catastrophic events (e.g., waking during surgery, anaphylactic shock).\nWitnessed events include, but are not limited to, observing threatened or serious injury,\nunnatural death, physical or sexual abuse of another person due to violent assault, domes-\ntic violence, accident, war or disaster, or a medical catastrophe in one’s child (e.g., a life-\nthreatening hemorrhage). Indirect exposure through learning about an event is limited to\nexperiences affecting close relatives or friends and experiences that are violent or acciden-\ntal (e.g., death due to natural causes does not qualify). Such events include violent per-\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder\n275\nsonal assault, suicide, serious accident, and serious injury. The disorder may be especially\nsevere or long-lasting when the stressor is interpersonal and intentional (e.g., torture, sex-\nual violence).\nThe traumatic event can be reexperienced in various ways. Commonly, the individual\nhas recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive recollections of the event (Criterion B1). Intrusive\nrecollections in PTSD are distinguished from depressive rumination in that they apply\nonly to involuntary and intrusive distressing memories. The emphasis is on recurrent\nmemories of the event that usually include sensory, emotional, or physiological behavioral\ncomponents. A common reexperiencing symptom is distressing dreams that replay the\nevent itself or that are representative or thematically related to the major threats involved\nin the traumatic event (Criterion B2). The individual may experience dissociative states\nthat last from a few seconds to several hours or even days, during which components of\nthe event are relived and the individual behaves as if the event were occurring at that mo-\nment (Criterion B3). Such events occur on a continuum from brief visual or other sensory\nintrusions about part of the traumatic event without loss of reality orientation, to complete\nloss of awareness of present surroundings. These episodes, often referred to as “flash-\nbacks,” are typically brief but can be associated with prolonged distress and heightened\narousal. For young children, reenactment of events related to trauma may appear in play\nor in dissociative states. Intense psychological distress (Criterion B4) or physiological re-\nactivity (Criterion B5) often occurs when the individual is exposed to triggering events that\nresemble or symbolize an aspect of the traumatic event (e.g., windy days after a hurricane;\nseeing someone who resembles one’s perpetrator). The triggering cue could be a physical\nsensation (e.g., dizziness for survivors of head trauma; rapid heartbeat for a previously\ntraumatized child), particularly for individuals with highly somatic presentations.\nStimuli associated with the trauma are persistently (e.g., always or almost always)\navoided. The individual commonly makes deliberate efforts to avoid thoughts, memories,\nfeelings, or talking about the traumatic event (e.g., utilizing distraction techniques to avoid\ninternal reminders) (Criterion C1) and to avoid activities, objects, situations, or people\nwho arouse recollections of it (Criterion C2).\nNegative alterations in cognitions or mood associated with the event begin or worsen\nafter exposure to the event. These negative alterations can take various forms, including an\ninability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event; such amnesia is typically\ndue to dissociative amnesia and is not due to head injury, alcohol, or drugs (Criterion D1).\nAnother form is persistent (i.e., always or almost always) and exaggerated negative ex-\npectations regarding important aspects of life applied to oneself, others, or the future (e.g.,\n“I have always had bad judgment”; “People in authority can’t be trusted”) that may man-\nifest as a negative change in perceived identity since the trauma (e.g., “I can’t trust anyone\never again”; Criterion D2). Individuals with PTSD may have persistent erroneous cogni-\ntions about the causes of the traumatic event that lead them to blame themselves or others\n(e.g., “It’s all my fault that my uncle abused me”) (Criterion D3). A persistent negative\nmood state (e.g., fear, horror, anger, guilt, shame) either began or worsened after exposure\nto the event (Criterion D4). The individual may experience markedly diminished interest\nor participation in previously enjoyed activities (Criterion D5), feeling detached or es-\ntranged from other people (Criterion D6), or a persistent inability to feel positive emotions\n(especially happiness, joy, satisfaction, or emotions associated with intimacy, tenderness,\nand sexuality) (Criterion D7).\nIndividuals with PTSD may be quick tempered and may even engage in aggressive\nverbal and/or physical behavior with little or no provocation (e.g., yelling at people, get-\nting into fights, destroying objects) (Criterion E1). They may also engage in reckless or self-\ndestructive behavior such as dangerous driving, excessive alcohol or drug use, or self-\ninjurious or suicidal behavior (Criterion E2).  PTSD is often characterized by a heightened\nsensitivity to potential threats, including those that are related to the traumatic experience\n(e.g., following a motor vehicle accident, being especially sensitive to the threat potentially\n276\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\ncaused by cars or trucks) and those not related to the traumatic event (e.g., being fearful of\nsuffering a heart attack) (Criterion E3). Individuals with PTSD may be very reactive to un-\nexpected stimuli, displaying a heightened startle response, or jumpiness, to loud noises or\nunexpected movements (e.g., jumping markedly in response to a telephone ringing) (Cri-\nterion E4). Concentration difficulties, including difficulty remembering daily events (e.g.,\nforgetting one’s telephone number) or attending to focused tasks (e.g., following a conver-\nsation for a sustained period of time), are commonly reported (Criterion E5). Problems\nwith sleep onset and maintenance are common and may be associated with nightmares\nand safety concerns or with generalized elevated arousal that interferes with adequate sleep\n(Criterion E6). Some individuals also experience persistent dissociative symptoms of de-\ntachment from their bodies (depersonalization) or the world around them (derealization);\nthis is reflected in the “with dissociative symptoms” specifier.", "associated_features": "Developmental regression, such as loss of language in young children, may occur. Audi-\ntory pseudo-hallucinations, such as having the sensory experience of hearing one’s\nthoughts spoken in one or more different voices, as well as paranoid ideation, can be pres-\nent. Following prolonged, repeated, and severe traumatic events (e.g., childhood abuse,\ntorture), the individual may additionally experience difficulties in regulating emotions or\nmaintaining stable interpersonal relationships, or dissociative symptoms. When the trau-\nmatic event produces violent death, symptoms of both problematic bereavement and PTSD\nmay be present.", "prevalence": "In the United States, projected lifetime risk for PTSD using DSM-IV criteria at age 75 years\nis 8.7%. Twelve-month prevalence among U.S. adults is about 3.5%. Lower estimates are\nseen in Europe and most Asian, African, and Latin American countries, clustering around\n0.5%–1.0%. Although different groups have different levels of exposure to traumatic\nevents, the conditional probability of developing PTSD following a similar level of expo-\nsure may also vary across cultural groups. Rates of PTSD are higher among veterans and\nothers whose vocation increases the risk of traumatic exposure (e.g., police, firefighters,\nemergency medical personnel). Highest rates (ranging from one-third to more than one-\nhalf of those exposed) are found among survivors of rape, military combat and captivity,\nand ethnically or politically motivated internment and genocide. The prevalence of PTSD\nmay vary across development; children and adolescents, including preschool children,\ngenerally have displayed lower prevalence following exposure to serious traumatic\nevents; however, this may be because previous criteria were insufficiently developmen-\ntally informed. The prevalence of full-threshold PTSD also appears to be lower among\nolder adults compared with the general population; there is evidence that subthreshold\npresentations are more common than full PTSD in later life and that these symptoms are\nassociated with substantial clinical impairment. Compared with U.S. non-Latino whites,\nhigher rates of PTSD have been reported among U.S. Latinos, African Americans, and\nAmerican Indians, and lower rates have been reported among Asian Americans, after ad-\njustment for traumatic exposure and demographic variables.", "development_course": "PTSD can occur at any age, beginning after the first year of life. Symptoms usually begin\nwithin the first 3 months after the trauma, although there may be a delay of months, or\neven years, before criteria for the diagnosis are met. There is abundant evidence for what\nDSM-IV called “delayed onset” but is now called “delayed expression,” with the recogni-\ntion that some symptoms typically appear immediately and that the delay is in meeting\nfull criteria.\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder\n277\nFrequently, an individual’s reaction to a trauma initially meets criteria for acute stress\ndisorder in the immediate aftermath of the trauma. The symptoms of PTSD and the rela-\ntive predominance of different symptoms may vary over time. Duration of the symptoms\nalso varies, with complete recovery within 3 months occurring in approximately one-half\nof adults, while some individuals remain symptomatic for longer than 12 months and\nsometimes for more than 50 years. Symptom recurrence and intensification may occur in\nresponse to reminders of the original trauma, ongoing life stressors, or newly experienced\ntraumatic events. For older individuals, declining health, worsening cognitive function-\ning, and social isolation may exacerbate PTSD symptoms.\nThe clinical expression of reexperiencing can vary across development. Young children\nmay report new onset of frightening dreams without content specific to the traumatic event.\nBefore age 6 years (see criteria for preschool subtype), young children are more likely to ex-\npress reexperiencing symptoms through play that refers directly or symbolically to the\ntrauma. They may not manifest fearful reactions at the time of the exposure or during reex-\nperiencing. Parents may report a wide range of emotional or behavioral changes in young\nchildren. Children may focus on imagined interventions in their play or storytelling. In ad-\ndition to avoidance, children may become preoccupied with reminders. Because of young\nchildren’s limitations in expressing thoughts or labeling emotions, negative alterations in\nmood or cognition tend to involve primarily mood changes. Children may experience co-\noccurring traumas (e.g., physical abuse, witnessing domestic violence) and in chronic cir-\ncumstances may not be able to identify onset of symptomatology. Avoidant behavior may\nbe associated with restricted play or exploratory behavior in young children; reduced par-\nticipation in new activities in school-age children; or reluctance to pursue developmental op-\nportunities in adolescents (e.g., dating, driving). Older children and adolescents may judge\nthemselves as cowardly. Adolescents may harbor beliefs of being changed in ways that\nmake them socially undesirable and estrange them from peers (e.g., “Now I’ll never fit in”)\nand lose aspirations for the future. Irritable or aggressive behavior in children and adoles-\ncents can interfere with peer relationships and school behavior. Reckless behavior may lead\nto accidental injury to self or others, thrill-seeking, or high-risk behaviors. Individuals who\ncontinue to experience PTSD into older adulthood may express fewer symptoms of hy-\nperarousal, avoidance, and negative cognitions and mood compared with younger adults\nwith PTSD, although adults exposed to traumatic events during later life may display more\navoidance, hyperarousal, sleep problems, and crying spells than do younger adults exposed\nto the same traumatic events. In older individuals, the disorder is associated with negative\nhealth perceptions, primary care utilization, and suicidal ideation.", "risk_factors": "Risk (and protective) factors are generally divided into pretraumatic, peritraumatic, and\nposttraumatic factors.\nPretraumatic factors\nTemperamental.\nThese include childhood emotional problems by age 6 years (e.g., prior\ntraumatic exposure, externalizing or anxiety problems) and prior mental disorders (e.g.,\npanic disorder, depressive disorder, PTSD, or obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD]).\nEnvironmental.\nThese include lower socioeconomic status; lower education; exposure to\nprior trauma (especially during childhood); childhood adversity (e.g., economic depriva-\ntion, family dysfunction, parental separation or death); cultural characteristics (e.g., fatal-\nistic or self-blaming coping strategies); lower intelligence; minority racial/ethnic status;\nand a family psychiatric history. Social support prior to event exposure is protective.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThese include female gender and younger age at the time of\ntrauma exposure (for adults). Certain genotypes may either be protective or increase risk\nof PTSD after exposure to traumatic events.\n278\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\nPeritraumatic factors\nEnvironmental.\nThese include severity (dose) of the trauma (the greater the magnitude\nof trauma, the greater the likelihood of PTSD), perceived life threat, personal injury, in-\nterpersonal violence (particularly trauma perpetrated by a caregiver or involving a wit-\nnessed threat to a caregiver in children), and, for military personnel, being a perpetrator,\nwitnessing atrocities, or killing the enemy. Finally, dissociation that occurs during the trauma\nand persists afterward is a risk factor.\nPosttraumatic factors\nTemperamental.\nThese include negative appraisals, inappropriate coping strategies,\nand development of acute stress disorder.\nEnvironmental.\nThese include subsequent exposure to repeated upsetting reminders, subse-\nquent adverse life events, and financial or other trauma-related losses. Social support (includ-\ning family stability, for children) is a protective factor that moderates outcome after trauma.", "cultural_issues": "The risk of onset and severity of PTSD may differ across cultural groups as a result of vari-\nation in the type of traumatic exposure (e.g., genocide), the impact on disorder severity of\nthe meaning attributed to the traumatic event (e.g., inability to perform funerary rites after\na mass killing), the ongoing sociocultural context (e.g., residing among unpunished per-\npetrators in postconflict settings), and other cultural factors (e.g., acculturative stress in\nimmigrants). The relative risk for PTSD of particular exposures (e.g., religious persecu-\ntion) may vary across cultural groups. The clinical expression of the symptoms or symp-\ntom clusters of PTSD may vary culturally, particularly with respect to avoidance and\nnumbing symptoms, distressing dreams, and somatic symptoms (e.g., dizziness, short-\nness of breath, heat sensations).\nCultural syndromes and idioms of distress influence the expression of PTSD and the\nrange of comorbid disorders in different cultures by providing behavioral and cognitive\ntemplates that link traumatic exposures to specific symptoms. For example, panic attack\nsymptoms may be salient in PTSD among Cambodians and Latin Americans because of\nthe association of traumatic exposure with panic-like khyâl attacks and ataque de nervios.\nComprehensive evaluation of local expressions of PTSD should include assessment of cul-\ntural concepts of distress (see the chapter “Cultural Formulation” in Section III).", "gender_issues": "PTSD is more prevalent among females than among males across the lifespan. Females in\nthe general population experience PTSD for a longer duration than do males. At least some\nof the increased risk for PTSD in females appears to be attributable to a greater likelihood\nof exposure to traumatic events, such as rape, and other forms of interpersonal violence.\nWithin populations exposed specifically to such stressors, gender differences in risk for\nPTSD are attenuated or nonsignificant.", "diagnostic_markers": "", "suicide_risk": "Traumatic events such as childhood abuse increase a person’s suicide risk. PTSD is associated\nwith suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, and presence of the disorder may indicate which\nindividuals with ideation eventually make a suicide plan or actually attempt suicide.", "functional_consequences": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder\nPTSD is associated with high levels of social, occupational, and physical disability, as well\nas considerable economic costs and high levels of medical utilization. Impaired function-\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder\n279\ning is exhibited across social, interpersonal, developmental, educational, physical health,\nand occupational domains. In community and veteran samples, PTSD is associated with\npoor social and family relationships, absenteeism from work, lower income, and lower ed-\nucational and occupational success.", "differential_diagnosis": "Adjustment disorders.\nIn adjustment disorders, the stressor can be of any severity or\ntype rather than that required by PTSD Criterion A. The diagnosis of an adjustment dis-\norder is used when the response to a stressor that meets PTSD Criterion A does not meet\nall other PTSD criteria (or criteria for another mental disorder). An adjustment disorder is\nalso diagnosed when the symptom pattern of PTSD occurs in response to a stressor that\ndoes not meet PTSD Criterion A (e.g., spouse leaving, being fired).\nOther posttraumatic disorders and conditions.\nNot all psychopathology that occurs in\nindividuals exposed to an extreme stressor should necessarily be attributed to PTSD. The\ndiagnosis requires that trauma exposure precede the onset or exacerbation of pertinent\nsymptoms. Moreover, if the symptom response pattern to the extreme stressor meets cri-\nteria for another mental disorder, these diagnoses should be given instead of, or in addi-\ntion to, PTSD. Other diagnoses and conditions are excluded if they are better explained by\nPTSD (e.g., symptoms of panic disorder that occur only after exposure to traumatic re-\nminders). If severe, symptom response patterns to the extreme stressor may warrant a sep-\narate diagnosis (e.g., dissociative amnesia).\nAcute stress disorder.\nAcute stress disorder is distinguished from PTSD because the\nsymptom pattern in acute stress disorder is restricted to a duration of 3 days to 1 month\nfollowing exposure to the traumatic event.\nAnxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nIn OCD, there are recurrent\nintrusive thoughts, but these meet the definition of an obsession. In addition, the intrusive\nthoughts are not related to an experienced traumatic event, compulsions are usually pres-\nent, and other symptoms of PTSD or acute stress disorder are typically absent. Neither the\narousal and dissociative symptoms of panic disorder nor the avoidance, irritability, and\nanxiety of generalized anxiety disorder are associated with a specific traumatic event. The\nsymptoms of separation anxiety disorder are clearly related to separation from home or\nfamily, rather than to a traumatic event.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nMajor depression may or may not be preceded by a trau-\nmatic event and should be diagnosed if other PTSD symptoms are absent. Specifically, ma-\njor depressive disorder does not include any PTSD Criterion B or C symptoms. Nor does it\ninclude a number of symptoms from PTSD Criterion D or E.\nPersonality disorders.\nInterpersonal difficulties that had their onset, or were greatly ex-\nacerbated, after exposure to a traumatic event may be an indication of PTSD, rather than a\npersonality disorder, in which such difficulties would be expected independently of any\ntraumatic exposure.\nDissociative disorders.\nDissociative amnesia, dissociative identity disorder, and de-\npersonalization-derealization disorder may or may not be preceded by exposure to a trau-\nmatic event or may or may not have co-occurring PTSD symptoms. When full PTSD criteria\nare also met, however, the PTSD “with dissociative symptoms” subtype should be considered.\nConversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).\nNew onset of somatic\nsymptoms within the context of posttraumatic distress might be an indication of PTSD\nrather than conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).\nPsychotic disorders.\nFlashbacks in PTSD must be distinguished from illusions, halluci-\nnations, and other perceptual disturbances that may occur in schizophrenia, brief psy-\nchotic disorder, and other psychotic disorders; depressive and bipolar disorders with\n280\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\npsychotic features; delirium; substance/medication-induced disorders; and psychotic dis-\norders due to another medical condition.\nTraumatic brain injury.\nWhen a brain injury occurs in the context of a traumatic event (e.g.,\ntraumatic accident, bomb blast, acceleration/deceleration trauma), symptoms of PTSD may\nappear. An event causing head trauma may also constitute a psychological traumatic event,\nand tramautic brain injury (TBI)–related neurocognitive symptoms are not mutually exclusive\nand may occur concurrently. Symptoms previously termed postconcussive (e.g., headaches,\ndizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, irritability, concentration deficits) can occur in brain-\ninjured and non-brain-injured populations, including individuals with PTSD. Because symp-\ntoms of PTSD and TBI-related neurocognitive symptoms can overlap, a differential diagnosis\nbetween PTSD and neurocognitive disorder symptoms attributable to TBI may be possible\nbased on the presence of symptoms that are distinctive to each presentation. Whereas reexpe-\nriencing and avoidance are characteristic of PTSD and not the effects of TBI, persistent disori-\nentation and confusion are more specific to TBI (neurocognitive effects) than to PTSD.", "comorbidity": "Individuals with PTSD are 80% more likely than those without PTSD to have symptoms\nthat meet diagnostic criteria for at least one other mental disorder (e.g., depressive, bipo-\nlar, anxiety, or substance use disorders). Comorbid substance use disorder and conduct\ndisorder are more common among males than among females. Among U.S. military per-\nsonnel and combat veterans who have been deployed to recent wars in Afghanistan and\nIraq, co-occurrence of PTSD and mild TBI is 48%. Although most young children with\nPTSD also have at least one other diagnosis, the patterns of comorbidity are different than\nin adults, with oppositional defiant disorder and separation anxiety disorder predominat-\ning. Finally, there is considerable comorbidity between PTSD and major neurocognitive\ndisorder and some overlapping symptoms between these disorders."}, "provenance": {"source_file": "trauma_stressor_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 3, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.632134"}}

For children, sexually traumatic events may\ninclude inappropriate sexual experiences without violence or injury. A life-threatening\nillness or debilitating medical condition is not necessarily considered a traumatic event.\nMedical incidents that qualify as traumatic events involve sudden, catastrophic events (e.g.,\nwaking during surgery, anaphylactic shock). Stressful events that do not possess the severe\nand traumatic components of events encompassed by Criterion A may lead to an adjust-\nment disorder but not to acute stress disorder.\nThe clinical presentation of acute stress disorder may vary by individual but typically\ninvolves an anxiety response that includes some form of reexperiencing of or reactivity to\nthe traumatic event. In some individuals, a dissociative or detached presentation can pre-\ndominate, although these individuals typically will also display strong emotional or phys-\niological reactivity in response to trauma reminders. In other individuals, there can be a\nstrong anger response in which reactivity is characterized by irritable or possibly aggres-\nsive responses. The full symptom picture must be present for at least 3 days after the trau-\nmatic event and can be diagnosed only up to 1 month after the event. Symptoms that occur\nimmediately after the event but resolve in less than 3 days would not meet criteria for\nacute stress disorder.\nWitnessed events include, but are not limited to, observing threatened or serious in-\njury, unnatural death, physical or sexual violence inflicted on another individual as a re-\nsult of violent assault, severe domestic violence, severe accident, war, and disaster; it may\nalso include witnessing a medical catastrophe (e.g., a life-threatening hemorrhage) involv-\ning one’s child. Events experienced indirectly through learning about the event are limited\nto close relatives or close friends. Such events must have been violent or accidental—death\ndue to natural causes does not qualify—and include violent personal assault, suicide, se-\nrious accident, or serious injury. The disorder may be especially severe when the stressor\nis interpersonal and intentional (e.g., torture, rape). The likelihood of developing this dis-\norder may increase as the intensity of and physical proximity to the stressor increase.\nThe traumatic event can be reexperienced in various ways. Commonly, the individual\nhas recurrent and intrusive recollections of the event (Criterion B1). The recollections are\nspontaneous or triggered recurrent memories of the event that usually occur in response\nto a stimulus that is reminiscent of the traumatic experience (e.g., the sound of a backfiring\ncar triggering memories of gunshots). These intrusive memories often include sensory\n(e.g., sensing the intense heat that was perceived in a house fire), emotional (e.g., experi-\nencing the fear of believing that one was about to be stabbed), or physiological (e.g., expe-\nriencing the shortness of breath that one suffered during a near-drowning) components.\nDistressing dreams may contain themes that are representative of or thematically re-\nlated to the major threats involved in the traumatic event. (For example, in the case of a\nmotor vehicle accident survivor, the distressing dreams may involve crashing cars gener-\nally; in the case of a combat soldier, the distressing dreams may involve being harmed in\nways other than combat.)\nDissociative states may last from a few seconds to several hours, or even days, during\nwhich components of the event are relived and the individual behaves as though experi-\nencing the event at that moment. While dissociative responses are common during a trau-\nmatic event, only dissociative responses that persist beyond 3 days after trauma exposure\nare considered for the diagnosis of acute stress disorder. For young children, reenactment\nof events related to trauma may appear in play and may include dissociative moments\n(e.g., a child who survives a motor vehicle accident may repeatedly crash toy cars during\nplay in a focused and distressing manner). These episodes, often referred to as flashbacks,\nare typically brief but involve a sense that the traumatic event is occurring in the present\nrather than being remembered in the past and are associated with significant distress.\nAcute Stress Disorder\n283\nSome individuals with the disorder do not have intrusive memories of the event itself,\nbut instead experience intense psychological distress or physiological reactivity when\nthey are exposed to triggering events that resemble or symbolize an aspect of the traumatic\nevent (e.g., windy days for children after a hurricane, entering an elevator for a male or fe-\nmale who was raped in an elevator, seeing someone who resembles one’s perpetrator).\nThe triggering cue could be a physical sensation (e.g., a sense of heat for a burn victim, diz-\nziness for survivors of head trauma), particularly for individuals with highly somatic pre-\nsentations. The individual may have a persistent inability to feel positive emotions (e.g.,\nhappiness, joy, satisfaction, or emotions associated with intimacy, tenderness, or sexual-\nity) but can experience negative emotions such as fear, sadness, anger, guilt, or shame.\nAlterations in awareness can include depersonalization, a detached sense of oneself (e.g.,\nseeing oneself from the other side of the room), or derealization, having a distorted view of\none’s surroundings (e.g., perceiving that things are moving in slow motion, seeing things\nin a daze, not being aware of events that one would normally encode). Some individuals\nalso report an inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event that was\npresumably encoded. This symptom is attributable to dissociative amnesia and is not at-\ntributable to head injury, alcohol, or drugs.\nStimuli associated with the trauma are persistently avoided. The individual may refuse\nto discuss the traumatic experience or may engage in avoidance strategies to minimize\nawareness of emotional reactions (e.g., excessive alcohol use when reminded of the ex-\nperience). This behavioral avoidance may include avoiding watching news coverage of\nthe traumatic experience, refusing to return to a workplace where the trauma occurred, or\navoiding interacting with others who shared the same traumatic experience.\nIt is very common for individuals with acute stress disorder to experience problems\nwith sleep onset and maintenance, which may be associated with nightmares or with gen-\neralized elevated arousal that prevents adequate sleep. Individuals with acute stress dis-\norder may be quick tempered and may even engage in aggressive verbal and/or physical\nbehavior with little provocation. Acute stress disorder is often characterized by a height-\nened sensitivity to potential threats, including those that are related to the traumatic ex-\nperience (e.g., a motor vehicle accident victim may be especially sensitive to the threat\npotentially caused by any cars or trucks) or those not related to the traumatic event (e.g.,\nfear of having a heart attack). Concentration difficulties, including difficulty remembering\ndaily events (e.g., forgetting one’s telephone number) or attending to focused tasks (e.g.,\nfollowing a conversation for a sustained period of time), are commonly reported. Individ-\nuals with acute stress disorder may be very reactive to unexpected stimuli, displaying a\nheightened startle response or jumpiness to loud noises or unexpected movements (e.g.,\nthe individual may jump markedly in the response to a telephone ringing).", "associated_features": "Individuals with acute stress disorder commonly engage in catastrophic or extremely neg-\native thoughts about their role in the traumatic event, their response to the traumatic ex-\nperience, or the likelihood of future harm. For example, an individual with acute stress\ndisorder may feel excessively guilty about not having prevented the traumatic event or\nabout not adapting to the experience more successfully. Individuals with acute stress dis-\norder may also interpret their symptoms in a catastrophic manner, such that flashback\nmemories or emotional numbing may be interpreted as a sign of diminished mental ca-\npacity. It is common for individuals with acute stress disorder to experience panic attacks\nin the initial month after trauma exposure that may be triggered by trauma reminders or\nmay apparently occur spontaneously. Additionally, individuals with acute stress disorder\nmay display chaotic or impulsive behavior. For example, individuals may drive reck-\nlessly, make irrational decisions, or gamble excessively. In children, there may be sig-\nnificant separation anxiety, possibly manifested by excessive needs for attention from\n284\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\ncaregivers. In the case of bereavement following a death that occurred in traumatic cir-\ncumstances, the symptoms of acute stress disorder can involve acute grief reactions. In\nsuch cases, reexperiencing, dissociative, and arousal symptoms may involve reactions to\nthe loss, such as intrusive memories of the circumstances of the individual’s death, disbe-\nlief that the individual has died, and anger about the death. Postconcussive symptoms\n(e.g., headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, irritability, concentration deficits),\nwhich occur frequently following mild traumatic brain injury, are also frequently seen in\nindividuals with acute stress disorder. Postconcussive symptoms are equally common in\nbrain-injured and non–brain-injured populations, and the frequent occurrence of postcon-\ncussive symptoms could be attributable to acute stress disorder symptoms.", "prevalence": "The prevalence of acute stress disorder in recently trauma-exposed populations (i.e.,\nwithin 1 month of trauma exposure) varies according to the nature of the event and the\ncontext in which it is assessed. In both U.S. and non-U.S. populations, acute stress disorder\ntends to be identified in less than 20% of cases following traumatic events that do not in-\nvolve interpersonal assault; 13%–21% of motor vehicle accidents, 14% of mild traumatic\nbrain injury, 19% of assault, 10% of severe burns, and 6%–12% of industrial accidents.\nHigher rates (i.e., 20%–50%) are reported following interpersonal traumatic events, in-\ncluding assault, rape, and witnessing a mass shooting.", "development_course": "Acute stress disorder cannot be diagnosed until 3 days after a traumatic event. Although\nacute stress disorder may progress to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after 1 month,\nit may also be a transient stress response that remits within 1 month of trauma exposure\nand does not result in PTSD. Approximately half of individuals who eventually develop\nPTSD initially present with acute stress disorder. Symptom worsening during the initial\nmonth can occur, often as a result of ongoing life stressors or further traumatic events.\nThe forms of reexperiencing can vary across development. Unlike adults or adoles-\ncents, young children may report frightening dreams without content that clearly reflects\naspects of the trauma (e.g., waking in fright in the aftermath of the trauma but being unable\nto relate the content of the dream to the traumatic event). Children age 6 years and younger\nare more likely than older children to express reexperiencing symptoms through play that\nrefers directly or symbolically to the trauma. For example, a very young child who sur-\nvived a fire may draw pictures of flames. Young children also do not necessarily manifest\nfearful reactions at the time of the exposure or even during reexperiencing. Parents typi-\ncally report a range of emotional expressions, such as anger, shame, or withdrawal, and\neven excessively bright positive affect, in young children who are traumatized. Although\nchildren may avoid reminders of the trauma, they sometimes become preoccupied with\nreminders (e.g., a young child bitten by a dog may talk about dogs constantly yet avoid go-\ning outside because of fear of coming into contact with a dog).", "risk_factors": "Temperamental.\nRisk factors include prior mental disorder, high levels of negative af-\nfectivity (neuroticism), greater perceived severity of the traumatic event, and an avoidant\ncoping style. Catastrophic appraisals of the traumatic experience, often characterized by\nexaggerated appraisals of future harm, guilt, or hopelessness, are strongly predictive of\nacute stress disorder.\nEnvironmental.\nFirst and foremost, an individual must be exposed to a traumatic event to\nbe at risk for acute stress disorder. Risk factors for the disorder include a history of prior\ntrauma.\nAcute Stress Disorder\n285\nGenetic and physiological.\nFemales are at greater risk for developing acute stress dis-\norder.\nElevated reactivity, as reflected by acoustic startle response, prior to trauma exposure\nincreases the risk for developing acute stress disorder.", "cultural_issues": "The profile of symptoms of acute stress disorder may vary cross-culturally, particularly\nwith respect to dissociative symptoms, nightmares, avoidance, and somatic symptoms\n(e.g., dizziness, shortness of breath, heat sensations). Cultural syndromes and idioms of\ndistress shape the local symptom profiles of acute stress disorder. Some cultural groups\nmay display variants of dissociative responses, such as possession or trancelike behaviors\nin the initial month after trauma exposure. Panic symptoms may be salient in acute stress\ndisorder among Cambodians because of the association of traumatic exposure with panic-\nlike khyâl attacks, and ataque de nervios among Latin Americans may also follow a traumatic\nexposure.", "gender_issues": "Acute stress disorder is more prevalent among females than among males. Sex-linked neu-\nrobiological differences in stress response may contribute to females’ increased risk for\nacute stress disorder. The increased risk for the disorder in females may be attributable in\npart to a greater likelihood of exposure to the types of traumatic events with a high con-\nditional risk for acute stress disorder, such as rape and other interpersonal violence.", "diagnostic_markers": "", "suicide_risk": "", "functional_consequences": "Impaired functioning in social, interpersonal, or occupational domains has been shown\nacross survivors of accidents, assault, and rape who develop acute stress disorder. The ex-\ntreme levels of anxiety that may be associated with acute stress disorder may interfere\nwith sleep, energy levels, and capacity to attend to tasks. Avoidance in acute stress dis-\norder can result in generalized withdrawal from many situations that are perceived as\npotentially threatening, which can lead to nonattendance of medical appointments, avoid-\nance of driving to important appointments, and absenteeism from work.", "differential_diagnosis": "Adjustment disorders.\nIn acute stress disorder, the stressor can be of any severity rather\nthan of the severity and type required by Criterion A of acute stress disorder. The diagnosis of\nan adjustment disorder is used when the response to a Criterion A event does not meet the cri-\nteria for acute stress disorder (or another specific mental disorder) and when the symptom pat-\ntern of acute stress disorder occurs in response to a stressor that does not meet Criterion A for\nexposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence (e.g., spouse leaving,\nbeing fired). For example, severe stress reactions to life-threatening illnesses that may include\nsome acute stress disorder symptoms may be more appropriately described as an adjustment\ndisorder. Some forms of acute stress response do not include acute stress disorder symptoms\nand may be characterized by anger, depression, or guilt. These responses are more appro-\npriately described as primarily an adjustment disorder. Depressive or anger responses in an\nadjustment disorder may involve rumination about the traumatic event, as opposed to invol-\nuntary and intrusive distressing memories in acute stress disorder.\nPanic disorder.\nSpontaneous panic attacks are very common in acute stress disorder.\nHowever, panic disorder is diagnosed only if panic attacks are unexpected and there is\nanxiety about future attacks or maladaptive changes in behavior associated with fear of\ndire consequences of the attacks.\n286\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\nDissociative disorders.\nSevere dissociative responses (in the absence of characteristic\nacute stress disorder symptoms) may be diagnosed as derealization/depersonalization\ndisorder. If severe amnesia of the trauma persists in the absence of characteristic acute\nstress disorder symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative amnesia may be indicated.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder.\nAcute stress disorder is distinguished from PTSD because\nthe symptom pattern in acute stress disorder must occur within 1 month of the traumatic event\nand resolve within that 1-month period. If the symptoms persist for more than 1 month and\nmeet criteria for PTSD, the diagnosis is changed from acute stress disorder to PTSD.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nIn obsessive-compulsive disorder, there are recurrent\nintrusive thoughts, but these meet the definition of an obsession. In addition, the intrusive\nthoughts are not related to an experienced traumatic event, compulsions are usually pres-\nent, and other symptoms of acute stress disorder are typically absent.\nPsychotic disorders.\nFlashbacks in acute stress disorder must be distinguished from il-\nlusions, hallucinations, and other perceptual disturbances that may occur in schizophre-\nnia, other psychotic disorders, depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, a\ndelirium, substance/medication-induced disorders, and psychotic disorders due to an-\nother medical condition. Acute stress disorder flashbacks are distinguished from these\nother perceptual disturbances by being directly related to the traumatic experience and by\noccurring in the absence of other psychotic or substance-induced features.\nTraumatic brain injury.\nWhen a brain injury occurs in the context of a traumatic event\n(e.g., traumatic accident, bomb blast, acceleration/deceleration trauma), symptoms of\nacute stress disorder may appear. An event causing head trauma may also constitute a\npsychological traumatic event, and tramautic brain injury (TBI)–related neurocognitive\nsymptoms are not mutually exclusive and may occur concurrently. Symptoms previously\ntermed postconcussive (e.g., headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, irritability,\nconcentration deficits) can occur in brain-injured and non–brain injured populations, in-\ncluding individuals with acute stress disorder. Because symptoms of acute stress disorder\nand TBI-related neurocognitive symptoms can overlap, a differential diagnosis between\nacute stress disorder and neurocognitive disorder symptoms attributable to TBI may be\npossible based on the presence of symptoms that are distinctive to each presenta-\ntion. Whereas reexperiencing and avoidance are characteristic of acute stress disorder and\nnot the effects of TBI, persistent disorientation and confusion are more specific to TBI (neu-\nrocognitive effects) than to acute stress disorder. Furthermore, differential is aided by the\nfact that symptoms of acute stress disorder persist for up to only 1 month following trauma\nexposure.", "comorbidity": ""}, "provenance": {"source_file": "trauma_stressor_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 4, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.632134"}}

The symptom profile of major depressive disorder differentiates it from ad-\njustment disorders.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder.\nIn adjustment disorders, the\nstressor can be of any severity rather than of the severity and type required by Criterion A\nof acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In distinguishing ad-\njustment disorders from these two posttraumatic diagnoses, there are both timing and\nsymptom profile considerations. Adjustment disorders can be diagnosed immediately\nand persist up to 6 months after exposure to the traumatic event, whereas acute stress dis-\norder can only occur between 3 days and 1 month of exposure to the stressor, and PTSD\ncannot be diagnosed until at least 1 month has passed since the occurrence of the traumatic\nstressor. The required symptom profile for PTSD and acute stress disorder differentiates\nthem from the adjustment disorders. With regard to symptom profiles, an adjustment dis-\norder may be diagnosed following a traumatic event when an individual exhibits symptoms\nof either acute stress disorder or PTSD that do not meet or exceed the diagnostic threshold\nfor either disorder. An adjustment disorder should also be diagnosed for individuals who\nhave not been exposed to a traumatic event but who otherwise exhibit the full symptom pro-\nfile of either acute stress disorder or PTSD.\nPersonality disorders.\nWith regard to personality disorders, some personality features\nmay be associated with a vulnerability to situational distress that may resemble an adjust-\nment disorder. The lifetime history of personality functioning will help inform the in-\nterpretation of distressed behaviors to aid in distinguishing a long-standing personality\ndisorder from an adjustment disorder. In addition to some personality disorders incurring\nvulnerability to distress, stressors may also exacerbate personality disorder symptoms. In\nthe presence of a personality disorder, if the symptom criteria for an adjustment disorder\nare met, and the stress-related disturbance exceeds what may be attributable to maladap-\ntive personality disorder symptoms (i.e., Criterion C is met), then the diagnosis of an ad-\njustment disorder should be made.\nOther Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder\n289\nPsychological factors affecting other medical conditions.\nIn psychological factors af-\nfecting other medical conditions, specific psychological entities (e.g., psychological symp-\ntoms, behaviors, other factors) exacerbate a medical condition.
