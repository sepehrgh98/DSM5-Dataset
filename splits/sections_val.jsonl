A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood\nand abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 4 consec-\nutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day.\nB. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and activity, three (or more)\nof the following symptoms have persisted (four if the mood is only irritable), represent a no-\nticeable change from usual behavior, and have been present to a significant degree:\n1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.\n2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).\n3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.\nBipolar II Disorder\n133\n4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.\n5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external\nstimuli), as reported or observed.\n6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or\npsychomotor agitation.\n7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful conse-\nquences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or\nfoolish business investments).\nC. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is uncharac-\nteristic of the individual when not symptomatic.\nD. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable by others.\nE. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupa-\ntional functioning or to necessitate hospitalization. If there are psychotic features, the\nepisode is, by definition, manic.\nF. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug\nof abuse, a medication or other treatment).\nNote: A full hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g.,\nmedication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond\nthe physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a hypomanic episode\ndiagnosis. However, caution is indicated so that one or two symptoms (particularly in-\ncreased irritability, edginess, or agitation following antidepressant use) are not taken\nas sufficient for diagnosis of a hypomanic episode, nor necessarily indicative of a bi-\npolar diathesis.\nMajor Depressive Episode\nA. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week\nperiod and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms\nis either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.\nNote: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to a medical condition.\n1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjec-\ntive report (e.g., feels sad, empty, or hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g.,\nappears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)\n2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the\nday, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation).\n3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than\n5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every\nday. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)\n4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.\n5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others; not\nmerely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).\n6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.\n7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delu-\nsional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).\n8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (ei-\nther by subjective account or as observed by others).\n9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation with-\nout a specific plan, a suicide attempt, or a specific plan for committing suicide.\nB. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning.\nC. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another\nmedical condition.\n134\nBipolar and Related Disorders\nNote: Criteria A–C above constitute a major depressive episode.\nNote: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a nat-\nural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense sad-\nness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion\nA, which may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms may be under-\nstandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive episode\nin addition to the normal response to a significant loss should be carefully considered. This\ndecision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual’s history\nand the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss.1\nBipolar II Disorder\nA. Criteria have been met for at least one hypomanic episode (Criteria A–F under “Hypo-\nmanic Episode” above) and at least one major depressive episode (Criteria A–C under\n“Major Depressive Episode” above).\nB. There has never been a manic episode.\nC. The occurrence of the hypomanic episode(s) and major depressive episode(s) is not\nbetter explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disor-\nder, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and\nother psychotic disorder.\nD. The symptoms of depression or the unpredictability caused by frequent alternation be-\ntween periods of depression and hypomania causes clinically significant distress or im-\npairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\nCoding and Recording Procedures\nBipolar II disorder has one diagnostic code: 296.89 (F31.81). Its status with respect to cur-\nrent severity, presence of psychotic features, course, and other specifiers cannot be\ncoded but should be indicated in writing (e.g., 296.89 [F31.81] bipolar II disorder, current\nepisode depressed, moderate severity, with mixed features; 296.89 [F31.81] bipolar II dis-\norder, most recent episode depressed, in partial remission).\nSpecify current or most recent episode:\nHypomanic\nDepressed\nSpecify if:\nWith anxious distress (p. 149)\nWith mixed features (pp. 149–150)\n1In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that in grief\nthe predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss, while in a MDE it is persistent depressed\nmood and the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is likely to\ndecrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of grief. These\nwaves tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The depressed mood of a\nMDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations. The pain of grief may\nbe accompanied by positive emotions and humor that are uncharacteristic of the pervasive unhap-\npiness and misery characteristic of a MDE. The thought content associated with grief generally fea-\ntures a preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the deceased, rather than the self-critical or\npessimistic ruminations seen in a MDE. In grief, self-esteem is generally preserved, whereas in a\nMDE feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common. If self-derogatory ideation is present\nin grief, it typically involves perceived failings vis-à-vis the deceased (e.g., not visiting frequently\nenough, not telling the deceased how much he or she was loved). If a bereaved individual thinks\nabout death and dying, such thoughts are generally focused on the deceased and possibly about\n“'joining” the deceased, whereas in a MDE such thoughts are focused on ending one’s own life\nbecause of feeling worthless, undeserving of life, or unable to cope with the pain of depression.\nBipolar II Disorder\n135\nWith rapid cycling (pp. 150–151)\nWith mood-congruent psychotic features (p. 152)\nWith mood-incongruent psychotic features (p. 152)\nWith catatonia (p. 152).

The major depressive episode must last at least 2 weeks, and the hypomanic epi-\nsode must last at least 4 days, to meet the diagnostic criteria. During the mood episode(s),\nthe requisite number of symptoms must be present most of the day, nearly every day, and\nrepresent a noticeable change from usual behavior and functioning. The presence of a\nmanic episode during the course of illness precludes the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder\n(Criterion B under “Bipolar II Disorder”). Episodes of substance/medication-induced de-\npressive disorder or substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder (repre-\nsenting the physiological effects of a medication, other somatic treatments for depression,\ndrugs of abuse, or toxin exposure) or of depressive and related disorder due to another\nmedical condition or bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition do not\ncount toward a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder unless they persist beyond the physiolog-\nical effects of the treatment or substance and then meet duration criteria for an episode. In\naddition, the episodes must not be better accounted for by schizoaffective disorder and are\nnot superimposed on schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or\nother specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorders (Cri-\nterion C under “Bipolar II Disorder”). The depressive episodes or hypomanic fluctuations\nmust cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other\nimportant areas of functioning (Criterion D under “Bipolar II Disorder”); however, for hy-\npomanic episodes, this requirement does not have to be met. A hypomanic episode that\ncauses significant impairment would likely qualify for the diagnosis of manic episode and,\ntherefore, for a lifetime diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. The recurrent major depressive ep-\nisodes are often more frequent and lengthier than those occurring in bipolar I disorder.\nIndividuals with bipolar II disorder typically present to a clinician during a major de-\npressive episode and are unlikely to complain initially of hypomania. Typically, the hy-\npomanic episodes themselves do not cause impairment. Instead, the impairment results\nfrom the major depressive episodes or from a persistent pattern of unpredictable mood\nchanges and fluctuating, unreliable interpersonal or occupational functioning. Individu-\nals with bipolar II disorder may not view the hypomanic episodes as pathological or dis-\nadvantageous, although others may be troubled by the individual’s erratic behavior.\nClinical information from other informants, such as close friends or relatives, is often use-\nful in establishing the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder.\n136\nBipolar and Related Disorders\nA hypomanic episode should not be confused with the several days of euthymia and re-\nstored energy or activity that may follow remission of a major depressive episode. Despite the\nsubstantial differences in duration and severity between a manic and hypomanic episode, bi-\npolar II disorder is not a “milder form” of bipolar I disorder. Compared with individuals with\nbipolar I disorder, individuals with bipolar II disorder have greater chronicity of illness and\nspend, on average, more time in the depressive phase of their illness, which can be severe and/\nor disabling. Depressive symptoms co-occurring with a hypomanic episode or hypomanic\nsymptoms co-occurring with a depressive episode are common in individuals with bipolar II\ndisorder and are overrepresented in females, particularly hypomania with mixed features. In-\ndividuals experiencing hypomania with mixed features may not label their symptoms as hy-\npomania, but instead experience them as depression with increased energy or irritability.", "associated_features": "A common feature of bipolar II disorder is impulsivity, which can contribute to suicide at-\ntempts and substance use disorders. Impulsivity may also stem from a concurrent person-\nality disorder, substance use disorder, anxiety disorder, another mental disorder, or a\nmedical condition. There may be heightened levels of creativity in some individuals with\na bipolar disorder. However, that relationship may be nonlinear; that is, greater lifetime\ncreative accomplishments have been associated with milder forms of bipolar disorder, and\nhigher creativity has been found in unaffected family members. The individual’s attach-\nment to heightened creativity during hypomanic episodes may contribute to ambivalence\nabout seeking treatment or undermine adherence to treatment.", "prevalence": "The 12-month prevalence of bipolar II disorder, internationally, is 0.3%. In the United\nStates, 12-month prevalence is 0.8%. The prevalence rate of pediatric bipolar II disorder is\ndifficult to establish. DSM-IV bipolar I, bipolar II, and bipolar disorder not otherwise spec-\nified yield a combined prevalence rate of 1.8% in U.S. and non-U.S. community samples,\nwith higher rates (2.7% inclusive) in youths age 12 years or older.", "development_course": "Although bipolar II disorder can begin in late adolescence and throughout adulthood, av-\nerage age at onset is the mid-20s, which is slightly later than for bipolar I disorder but ear-\nlier than for major depressive disorder. The illness most often begins with a depressive\nepisode and is not recognized as bipolar II disorder until a hypomanic episode occurs; this\nhappens in about 12% of individuals with the initial diagnosis of major depressive disor-\nder. Anxiety, substance use, or eating disorders may also precede the diagnosis, compli-\ncating its detection. Many individuals experience several episodes of major depression\nprior to the first recognized hypomanic episode.\nThe number of lifetime episodes (both hypomanic and major depressive episodes)\ntends to be higher for bipolar II disorder than for major depressive disorder or bipolar I\ndisorder. However, individuals with bipolar I disorder are actually more likely to experi-\nence hypomanic symptoms than are individuals with bipolar II disorder.The interval\nbetween mood episodes in the course of bipolar II disorder tends to decrease as the indi-\nvidual ages. While the hypomanic episode is the feature that defines bipolar II disorder,\ndepressive episodes are more enduring and disabling over time. Despite the predomi-\nnance of depression, once a hypomanic episode has occurred, the diagnosis becomes bi-\npolar II disorder and never reverts to major depressive disorder.\nApproximately 5%–15% of individuals with bipolar II disorder have multiple (four or\nmore) mood episodes (hypomanic or major depressive) within the previous 12 months. If\nBipolar II Disorder\n137\nthis pattern is present, it is noted by the specifier “with rapid cycling.” By definition, psy-\nchotic symptoms do not occur in hypomanic episodes, and they appear to be less frequent\nin the major depressive episodes in bipolar II disorder than in those of bipolar I disorder.\nSwitching from a depressive episode to a manic or hypomanic episode (with or with-\nout mixed features) may occur, both spontaneously and during treatment for depression.\nAbout 5%–15% of individuals with bipolar II disorder will ultimately develop a manic ep-\nisode, which changes the diagnosis to bipolar I disorder, regardless of subsequent course.\nMaking the diagnosis in children is often a challenge, especially in those with irritabil-\nity and hyperarousal that is nonepisodic (i.e., lacks the well-demarcated periods of altered\nmood). Nonepisodic irritability in youth is associated with an elevated risk for anxiety dis-\norders and major depressive disorder, but not bipolar disorder, in adulthood. Persistently\nirritable youths have lower familial rates of bipolar disorder than do youths who have bi-\npolar disorder. For a hypomanic episode to be diagnosed, the child’s symptoms must ex-\nceed what is expected in a given environment and culture for the child’s developmental\nstage. Compared with adult onset of bipolar II disorder, childhood or adolescent onset of\nthe disorder may be associated with a more severe lifetime course. The 3-year incidence\nrate of first-onset bipolar II disorder in adults older than 60 years is 0.34%. However, dis-\ntinguishing individuals older than 60 years with bipolar II disorder by late versus early\nage at onset does not appear to have any clinical utility.", "risk_factors": "Genetic and physiological.\nThe risk of bipolar II disorder tends to be highest among rel-\natives of individuals with bipolar II disorder, as opposed to individuals with bipolar I dis-\norder or major depressive disorder. There may be genetic factors influencing the age at\nonset for bipolar disorders.\nCourse modifiers.\nA rapid-cycling pattern is associated with a poorer prognosis. Return\nto previous level of social function for individuals with bipolar II disorder is more likely\nfor individuals of younger age and with less severe depression, suggesting adverse effects\nof prolonged illness on recovery. More education, fewer years of illness, and being mar-\nried are independently associated with functional recovery in individuals with bipolar\ndisorder, even after diagnostic type (I vs. II), current depressive symptoms, and presence\nof psychiatric comorbidity are taken into account.", "cultural_issues": "", "gender_issues": "Whereas the gender ratio for bipolar I disorder is equal, findings on gender differences in\nbipolar II disorder are mixed, differing by type of sample (i.e., registry, community, or\nclinical) and country of origin. There is little to no evidence of bipolar gender differences,\nwhereas some, but not all, clinical samples suggest that bipolar II disorder is more com-\nmon in females than in males, which may reflect gender differences in treatment seeking\nor other factors.\nPatterns of illness and comorbidity, however, seem to differ by gender, with females\nbeing more likely than males to report hypomania with mixed depressive features and a\nrapid-cycling course. Childbirth may be a specific trigger for a hypomanic episode, which\ncan occur in 10%–20% of females in nonclinical populations and most typically in the early\npostpartum period. Distinguishing hypomania from the elated mood and reduced sleep\nthat normally accompany the birth of a child may be challenging. Postpartum hypomania\nmay foreshadow the onset of a depression that occurs in about half of females who expe-\nrience postpartum “highs.” Accurate detection of bipolar II disorder may help in estab-\nlishing appropriate treatment of the depression, which may reduce the risk of suicide and\ninfanticide.\n138\nBipolar and Related Disorders", "diagnostic_markers": "", "suicide_risk": "polar II disorder report a lifetime history of suicide attempt. The prevalence rates of life-\ntime attempted suicide in bipolar II and bipolar I disorder appear to be similar (32.4% and\n36.3%, respectively). However, the lethality of attempts, as defined by a lower ratio of at-\ntempts to completed suicides, may be higher in individuals with bipolar II disorder com-\npared with individuals with bipolar I disorder. There may be an association between\ngenetic markers and increased risk for suicidal behavior in individuals with bipolar dis-\norder, including a 6.5-fold higher risk of suicide among first-degree relatives of bipolar II\nprobands compared with those with bipolar I disorder.", "functional_consequences": "Although many individuals with bipolar II disorder return to a fully functional level be-\ntween mood episodes, at least 15% continue to have some inter-episode dysfunction, and\n20% transition directly into another mood episode without inter-episode recovery. Func-\ntional recovery lags substantially behind recovery from symptoms of bipolar II disorder,\nespecially in regard to occupational recovery, resulting in lower socioeconomic status de-\nspite equivalent levels of education with the general population. Individuals with bipolar\nII disorder perform more poorly than healthy individuals on cognitive tests and, with the\nexception of memory and semantic fluency, have similar cognitive impairment as do in-\ndividuals with bipolar I disorder. Cognitive impairments associated with bipolar II disor-\nder may contribute to vocational difficulties. Prolonged unemployment in individuals\nwith bipolar disorder is associated with more episodes of depression, older age, increased\nrates of current panic disorder, and lifetime history of alcohol use disorder.", "differential_diagnosis": "Major depressive disorder.\nPerhaps the most challenging differential diagnosis to con-\nsider is major depressive disorder, which may be accompanied by hypomanic or manic\nsymptoms that do not meet full criteria (i.e., either fewer symptoms or a shorter duration\nthan required for a hypomanic episode). This is especially true in evaluating individuals\nwith symptoms of irritability, which may be associated with either major depressive dis-\norder or bipolar II disorder.\nCyclothymic disorder.\nIn cyclothymic disorder, there are numerous periods of hypo-\nmanic symptoms and numerous periods of depressive symptoms that do not meet symp-\ntom or duration criteria for a major depressive episode. Bipolar II disorder is distinguished\nfrom cyclothymic disorder by the presence of one or more major depressive episodes. If a\nmajor depressive episode occurs after the first 2 years of cyclothymic disorder, the addi-\ntional diagnosis of bipolar II disorder is given.\nSchizophrenia spectrum and other related psychotic disorders.\nBipolar II disorder must\nbe distinguished from psychotic disorders (e.g., schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia,\nand delusional disorder). Schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and delusional disor-\nder are all characterized by periods of psychotic symptoms that occur in the absence of\nprominent mood symptoms. Other helpful considerations include the accompanying\nsymptoms, previous course, and family history.\nPanic disorder or other anxiety disorders.\nAnxiety disorders need to be considered in\nthe differential diagnosis and may frequently be present as co-occurring disorders.\nSubstance use disorders.\nSubstance use disorders are included in the differential diag-\nnosis.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\nmay be misdiagnosed as bipolar II disorder, especially in adolescents and children. Many\nCyclothymic Disorder\n139\nsymptoms of ADHD, such as rapid speech, racing thoughts, distractibility, and less need\nfor sleep, overlap with the symptoms of hypomania. The double counting of symptoms to-\nward both ADHD and bipolar II disorder can be avoided if the clinician clarifies whether\nthe symptoms represent a distinct episode and if the noticeable increase over baseline re-\nquired for the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder is present.\nPersonality disorders.\nThe same convention as applies for ADHD also applies when\nevaluating an individual for a personality disorder such as borderline personality disor-\nder, since mood lability and impulsivity are common in both personality disorders and bi-\npolar II disorder. Symptoms must represent a distinct episode, and the noticeable increase\nover baseline required for the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder must be present. A diagnosis\nof a personality disorder should not be made during an untreated mood episode unless\nthe lifetime history supports the presence of a personality disorder.\nOther bipolar disorders.\nDiagnosis of bipolar II disorder should be differentiated from\nbipolar I disorder by carefully considering whether there have been any past episodes of\nmania and from other specified and unspecified bipolar and related disorders by confirm-\ning the presence of fully syndromal hypomania and depression.", "comorbidity": "Bipolar II disorder is more often than not associated with one or more co-occurring mental\ndisorders, with anxiety disorders being the most common. Approximately 60% of individ-\nuals with bipolar II disorder have three or more co-occurring mental disorders; 75% have\nan anxiety disorder; and 37% have a substance use disorder. Children and adolescents\nwith bipolar II disorder have a higher rate of co-occurring anxiety disorders compared\nwith those with bipolar I disorder, and the anxiety disorder most often predates the bi-\npolar disorder. Anxiety and substance use disorders occur in individuals with bipolar II\ndisorder at a higher rate than in the general population. Approximately 14% of individuals\nwith bipolar II disorder have at least one lifetime eating disorder, with binge-eating dis-\norder being more common than bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa.\nThese commonly co-occurring disorders do not seem to follow a course of illness that\nis truly independent from that of the bipolar disorder, but rather have strong associations\nwith mood states. For example, anxiety and eating disorders tend to associate most with\ndepressive symptoms, and substance use disorders are moderately associated with manic\nsymptoms."}, "provenance": {"source_file": "bipolar_and_related_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 2, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.436383"}}

As evidenced by clinical history, physical examination, or\nlaboratory findings, the relevant depressive disorder should have developed during or\nwithin 1 month after use of a substance that is capable of producing the depressive disor-\nder (Criterion B1). In addition, the diagnosis is not better explained by an independent\ndepressive disorder. Evidence of an independent depressive disorder includes the de-\npressive disorder preceded the onset of ingestion or withdrawal from the substance; the\ndepressive disorder persists beyond a substantial period of time after the cessation of sub-\nstance use; or other evidence suggests the existence of an independent non-substance/\nmedication-induced depressive disorder (Criterion C). This diagnosis should not be made\nwhen symptoms occur exclusively during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The de-\npressive disorder associated with the substance use, intoxication, or withdrawal must\ncause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other impor-\ntant areas of functioning to qualify for this diagnosis (Criterion E).\nSome medications (e.g., stimulants, steroids, L-dopa, antibiotics, central nervous\nsystem drugs, dermatological agents, chemotherapeutic drugs, immunological agents)\n178\nDepressive Disorders\ncan induce depressive mood disturbances. Clinical judgment is essential to determine\nwhether the medication is truly associated with inducing the depressive disorder or\nwhether a primary depressive disorder happened to have its onset while the person was\nreceiving the treatment. For example, a depressive episode that developed within the first\nseveral weeks of beginning alpha-methyldopa (an antihypertensive agent) in an individ-\nual with no history of major depressive disorder would qualify for the diagnosis of med-\nication-induced depressive disorder. In some cases, a previously established condition\n(e.g., major depressive disorder, recurrent) can recur while the individual is coincidentally\ntaking a medication that has the capacity to cause depressive symptoms (e.g., L-dopa, oral\ncontraceptives). In such cases, the clinician must make a judgment as to whether the med-\nication is causative in this particular situation.\nA substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is distinguished from a primary\ndepressive disorder by considering the onset, course, and other factors associated with the\nsubstance use. There must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or labora-\ntory findings of substance use, abuse, intoxication, or withdrawal prior to the onset of the\ndepressive disorder.

Most often, the depressive disorder has\nits onset within the first few weeks or 1 month of use of the substance.

Except in the case of severe TBI, the typical course is that of complete or substantial\nimprovement in associated neurocognitive, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms and\nsigns. Neurocognitive symptoms associated with mild TBI tend to resolve within days to\nweeks after the injury with complete resolution typical by 3 months. Other symptoms that\nmay potentially co-occur with the neurological symptoms (e.g., depression, irritability,\nfatigue, headache, photosensitivity, sleep disturbance) also tend to resolve in the weeks\nfollowing mild TBI. Substantial subsequent deterioration in these areas should trigger con-\nsideration of additional diagnoses. However, repeated mild TBI may be associated with\npersisting neurocognitive disturbance.\nWith moderate and severe TBI, in addition to persistence of neurocognitive deficits,\nthere may be associated neurophysiological, emotional, and behavioral complications.\nThese include seizures (particularly in the first year), photosensitivity, hyperacusis, irritabil-\nity, aggression, depression, sleep disturbance, fatigue, apathy, inability to resume occu-\npational and social functioning at pre-injury level, and deterioration in interpersonal\nrelationships. Moderate and severe TBI have been associated with increased risk of depres-\nsion, aggression, and possibly neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.\nThe features of persisting major or mild NCD due to TBI will vary by age, specifics of\nthe injury, and cofactors. Persisting TBI-related impairment in an infant or child may be re-\nflected in delays in reaching developmental milestones (e.g., language acquisition), worse\nacademic performance, and possibly impaired social development. Among older teenag-\ners and adults, persisting symptoms may include various neurocognitive deficits, irrita-\nbility, hypersensitivity to light and sound, easy fatigability, and mood changes, including\ndepression, anxiety, hostility, or apathy.

Speech sound production requires both\nthe phonological knowledge of speech sounds and the ability to coordinate the movements of\nthe articulators (i.e., the jaw, tongue, and lips,) with breathing and vocalizing for speech. Chil-\ndren with speech production difficulties may experience difficulty with phonological knowl-\nedge of speech sounds or the ability to coordinate movements for speech in varying degrees.\nSpeech sound disorder is thus heterogeneous in its underlying mechanisms and includes pho-\nnological disorder and articulation disorder. A speech sound disorder is diagnosed when\nspeech sound production is not what would be expected based on the child’s age and devel-\nopmental stage and when the deficits are not the result of a physical, structural, neurological,\nor hearing impairment. Among typically developing children at age 4 years, overall speech\nshould be intelligible, whereas at age 2 years, only 50% may be understandable.", "associated_features": "Language disorder, particularly expressive deficits, may be found to co-occur with speech\nsound disorder. A positive family history of speech or language disorders is often present.\nIf the ability to rapidly coordinate the articulators is a particular aspect of difficulty,\nthere may be a history of delay or incoordination in acquiring skills that also utilize the\narticulators and related facial musculature; among others, these skills include chewing,\nmaintaining mouth closure, and blowing the nose. Other areas of motor coordination may\nbe impaired as in developmental coordination disorder. Verbal dyspraxia is a term also\nused for speech production problems.\nSpeech may be differentially impaired in certain genetic conditions (e.g., Down syn-\ndrome, 22q deletion, FoxP2 gene mutation). If present, these should also be coded.", "prevalence": "", "development_course": "Learning to produce speech sounds clearly and accurately and learning to produce con-\nnected speech fluently are developmental skills. Articulation of speech sounds follows a\nChildhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)\n45\ndevelopmental pattern, which is reflected in the age norms of standardized tests. It is not\nunusual for typically developing children to use developmental processes for shortening\nwords and syllables as they are learning to talk, but their progression in mastering speech\nsound production should result in mostly intelligible speech by age 3 years. Children with\nspeech sound disorder continue to use immature phonological simplification processes\npast the age when most children can produce words clearly.\nMost speech sounds should be produced clearly and most words should be pronounced\naccurately according to age and community norms by age 7 years. The most frequently mis-\narticulated sounds also tend to be learned later, leading them to be called the “late eight” (l, r,\ns, z, th, ch, dzh, and zh). Misarticulation of any of these sounds by itself could be considered\nwithin normal limits up to age 8 years. When multiple sounds are involved, it may be appro-\npriate to target some of those sounds as part of a plan to improve intelligibility prior to the age\nat which almost all children can produce them accurately. Lisping (i.e., misarticulating sibi-\nlants) is particularly common and may involve frontal or lateral patterns of airstream direc-\ntion. It may be associated with an abnormal tongue-thrust swallowing pattern.\nMost children with speech sound disorder respond well to treatment, and speech dif-\nficulties improve over time, and thus the disorder may not be lifelong.

Individuals with trichotillomania have made repeated at-\ntempts to decrease or stop hair pulling (Criterion B). Criterion C indicates that hair pulling\ncauses clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other impor-\ntant areas of functioning. The term distress includes negative affects that may be experi-\nenced by individuals with hair pulling, such as feeling a loss of control, embarrassment,\nand shame. Significant impairment may occur in several different areas of functioning\n(e.g., social, occupational, academic, and leisure), in part because of avoidance of work,\nschool, or other public situations.", "associated_features": "Hair pulling may be accompanied by a range of behaviors or rituals involving hair. Thus,\nindividuals may search for a particular kind of hair to pull (e.g., hairs with a specific tex-\nture or color), may try to pull out hair in a specific way (e.g., so that the root comes out in-\ntact), or may visually examine or tactilely or orally manipulate the hair after it has been\npulled (e.g., rolling the hair between the fingers, pulling the strand between the teeth, bit-\ning the hair into pieces, or swallowing the hair).\nHair pulling may also be preceded or accompanied by various emotional states; it may\nbe triggered by feelings of anxiety or boredom, may be preceded by an increasing sense of\ntension (either immediately before pulling out the hair or when attempting to resist the\nurge to pull), or may lead to gratification, pleasure, or a sense of relief when the hair is\npulled out. Hair-pulling behavior may involve varying degrees of conscious awareness,\nwith some individuals displaying more focused attention on the hair pulling (with pre-\nceding tension and subsequent relief), and other individuals displaying more automatic\nbehavior (in which the hair pulling seems to occur without full awareness). Many individ-\nuals report a mix of both behavioral styles. Some individuals experience an “itch-like” or\ntingling sensation in the scalp that is alleviated by the act of pulling hair. Pain does not\nusually accompany hair pulling.\nPatterns of hair loss are highly variable. Areas of complete alopecia, as well as areas of\nthinned hair density, are common. When the scalp is involved, there may be a predilection\nfor pulling out hair in the crown or parietal regions. There may be a pattern of nearly com-\nplete baldness except for a narrow perimeter around the outer margins of the scalp, par-\nticularly at the nape of the neck (“tonsure trichotillomania”). Eyebrows and eyelashes may\nbe completely absent.\nHair pulling does not usually occur in the presence of other individuals, except imme-\ndiate family members.

The dependent\n676\nPersonality Disorders\nand submissive behaviors are designed to elicit caregiving and arise from a self-perception\nof being unable to function adequately without the help of others.\nIndividuals with dependent personality disorder have great difficulty making every-\nday decisions (e.g., what color shirt to wear to work or whether to carry an umbrella) without\nan excessive amount of advice and reassurance from others (Criterion 1). These individu-\nals tend to be passive and to allow other people (often a single other person) to take the ini-\ntiative and assume responsibility for most major areas of their lives (Criterion 2). Adults\nwith this disorder typically depend on a parent or spouse to decide where they should\nlive, what kind of job they should have, and which neighbors to befriend. Adolescents\nwith this disorder may allow their parent(s) to decide what they should wear, with whom\nthey should associate, how they should spend their free time, and what school or college\nthey should attend. This need for others to assume responsibility goes beyond age-appro-\npriate and situation-appropriate requests for assistance from others (e.g., the specific\nneeds of children, elderly persons, and handicapped persons). Dependent personality dis-\norder may occur in an individual who has a serious medical condition or disability, but in\nsuch cases the difficulty in taking responsibility must go beyond what would normally be\nassociated with that condition or disability.\nBecause they fear losing support or approval, individuals with dependent personality\ndisorder often have difficulty expressing disagreement with other individuals, especially\nthose on whom they are dependent (Criterion 3). These individuals feel so unable to func-\ntion alone that they will agree with things that they feel are wrong rather than risk losing\nthe help of those to whom they look for guidance. They do not get appropriately angry at\nothers whose support and nurturance they need for fear of alienating them. If the individ-\nual’s concerns regarding the consequences of expressing disagreement are realistic (e.g.,\nrealistic fears of retribution from an abusive spouse), the behavior should not be consid-\nered to be evidence of dependent personality disorder.\nIndividuals with this disorder have difficulty initiating projects or doing things inde-\npendently (Criterion 4). They lack self-confidence and believe that they need help to begin\nand carry through tasks. They will wait for others to start things because they believe that\nas a rule others can do them better. These individuals are convinced that they are incapable\nof functioning independently and present themselves as inept and requiring constant as-\nsistance. They are, however, likely to function adequately if given the assurance that some-\none else is supervising and approving. There may be a fear of becoming or appearing to be\nmore competent, because they may believe that this will lead to abandonment. Because\nthey rely on others to handle their problems, they often do not learn the skills of indepen-\ndent living, thus perpetuating dependency.\nIndividuals with dependent personality disorder may go to excessive lengths to obtain\nnurturance and support from others, even to the point of volunteering for unpleasant\ntasks if such behavior will bring the care they need (Criterion 5). They are willing to submit\nto what others want, even if the demands are unreasonable. Their need to maintain an im-\nportant bond will often result in imbalanced or distorted relationships. They may make ex-\ntraordinary self-sacrifices or tolerate verbal, physical, or sexual abuse. (It should be noted\nthat this behavior should be considered evidence of dependent personality disorder only\nwhen it can clearly be established that other options are available to the individual.) Indi-\nviduals with this disorder feel uncomfortable or helpless when alone, because of their ex-\naggerated fears of being unable to care for themselves (Criterion 6). They will “tag along”\nwith important others just to avoid being alone, even if they are not interested or involved\nin what is happening.\nWhen a close relationship ends (e.g., a breakup with a lover; the death of a caregiver), in-\ndividuals with dependent personality disorder may urgently seek another relationship to\nprovide the care and support they need (Criterion 7).

They see themselves\nas so totally dependent on the advice and help of an important other person that they worry\nabout being abandoned by that person when there are no grounds to justify such fears. To be\nconsidered as evidence of this criterion, the fears must be excessive and unrealistic.

They may seek overprotection and dominance from others. Oc-\ncupational functioning may be impaired if independent initiative is required. They may\navoid positions of responsibility and become anxious when faced with decisions. Social re-\nlations tend to be limited to those few people on whom the individual is dependent. There\nmay be an increased risk of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and adjustment dis-\norders. Dependent personality disorder often co-occurs with other personality disorders,\nespecially borderline, avoidant, and histrionic personality disorders.

It is therefore important to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in\ntheir characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features that meet cri-\nteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to dependent personality disorder, all\ncan be diagnosed. Although many personality disorders are characterized by dependent\nfeatures, dependent personality disorder can be distinguished by its predominantly submis-\nsive, reactive, and clinging behavior. Both dependent personality disorder and borderline\npersonality disorder are characterized by fear of abandonment; however, the individual\nwith borderline personality disorder reacts to abandonment with feelings of emotional emp-\ntiness, rage, and demands, whereas the individual with dependent personality disorder re-\nacts with increasing appeasement and submissiveness and urgently seeks a replacement\nrelationship to provide caregiving and support. Borderline personality disorder can further\nbe distinguished from dependent personality disorder by a typical pattern of unstable and\nintense relationships. Individuals with histrionic personality disorder, like those with de-\npendent personality disorder, have a strong need for reassurance and approval and may ap-\npear childlike and clinging. However, unlike dependent personality disorder, which is\ncharacterized by self-effacing and docile behavior, histrionic personality disorder is charac-\nterized by gregarious flamboyance with active demands for attention. Both dependent\npersonality disorder and avoidant personality disorder are characterized by feelings of in-\nadequacy, hypersensitivity to criticism, and a need for reassurance; however, individuals\nwith avoidant personality disorder have such a strong fear of humiliation and rejection that\nthey withdraw until they are certain they will be accepted. In contrast, individuals with de-\npendent personality disorder have a pattern of seeking and maintaining connections to im-\nportant others, rather than avoiding and withdrawing from relationships.\nMany individuals display dependent personality traits.

Sleepiness typically occurs daily but must occur at a minimum three times a week\nfor at least 3 months (Criterion A). Narcolepsy generally produces cataplexy, which most\ncommonly presents as brief episodes (seconds to minutes) of sudden, bilateral loss of mus-\ncle tone precipitated by emotions, typically laughing and joking. Muscles affected may\ninclude those of the neck, jaw, arms, legs, or whole body, resulting in head bobbing, jaw\ndropping, or complete falls. Individuals are awake and aware during cataplexy. To meet\nCriterion B1(a), cataplexy must be triggered by laughter or joking and must occur at least\na few times per month when the condition is untreated or in the past.\nCataplexy should not be confused with “weakness” occurring in the context of athletic\nactivities (physiological) or exclusively after unusual emotional triggers such as stress or\nanxiety (suggesting possible psychopathology). Episodes lasting hours or days, or those not\ntriggered by emotions, are unlikely to be cataplexy, nor is rolling on the floor while laugh-\ning hysterically.\nIn children close to onset, genuine cataplexy can be atypical, affecting primarily the\nface, causing grimaces or jaw opening with tongue thrusting (“cataplectic faces”).

In these cases, Criterion B1(b) can be met in children or in individuals within 6 months\nof a rapid onset.\nNarcolepsy-cataplexy nearly always results from the loss of hypothalamic hypocretin\n(orexin)–producing cells, causing hypocretin deficiency (less than or equal to one-third of\ncontrol values, or 110 pg/mL in most laboratories). Cell loss is likely autoimmune, and ap-\nproximately 99% of affected individuals carry HLA-DQB1*06:02 (vs. 12%–38% of control\nsubjects). Thus, checking for the presence of DQB1*06:02 prior to a lumbar puncture for eval-\nuation of CSF hypocretin-1 immunoreactivity may be useful.

Short rapid eye movement (REM) latency\n(sleep-onset REM period, REM latency less than or equal to 15 minutes) during polysom-\nnography is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis and meets Criterion B3.

Higher drug use by\npeers and high sensation seeking have also been associated with elevated rates of ecstasy use.\nMDMA/ecstasy use appears to signify a more severe group of hallucinogen users.\nGenetic and physiological.\nAmong male twins, total variance due to additive genetics\nhas been estimated to range from 26% to 79%, with inconsistent evidence for shared envi-\nronmental influences.", "cultural_issues": "Historically, hallucinogens have been used as part of established religious practices, such\nas the use of peyote in the Native American Church and in Mexico. Ritual use by indige-\nnous populations of psilocybin obtained from certain types of mushrooms has occurred in\nSouth America, Mexico, and some areas in the United States, or of ayahuasca in the Santo\nDaime and União de Vegetal sects. Regular use of peyote as part of religious rituals is not\nlinked to neuropsychological or psychological deficits. For adults, no race or ethnicity dif-\nferences for the full criteria or for any individual criterion are apparent at this time.", "gender_issues": "In adolescents, females may be less likely than males to endorse “hazardous use,” and fe-\nmale gender may be associated with increased odds of other hallucinogen use disorder.", "diagnostic_markers": "Laboratory testing can be useful in distinguishing among the different hallucinogens.\nHowever, because some agents (e.g., LSD) are so potent that as little as 75 micrograms can\nproduce severe reactions, typical toxicological examination will not always reveal which\nsubstance has been used.\nPhencyclidine Intoxication\n527", "suicide_risk": "", "functional_consequences": "Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder\nThere is evidence for long-term neurotoxic effects of MDMA/ecstasy use, including im-\npairments in memory, psychological function, and neuroendocrine function; serotonin\nsystem dysfunction; and sleep disturbance; as well as adverse effects on brain microvas-\nculature, white matter maturation, and damage to axons. Use of MDMA/ecstasy may di-\nminish functional connectivity among brain regions.", "differential_diagnosis": "Other substance use disorders.\nThe effects of hallucinogens must be distinguished from\nthose of other substances (e.g., amphetamines), especially because contamination of the\nhallucinogens with other drugs is relatively common.\nSchizophrenia.\nSchizophrenia also must be ruled out, as some affected individuals (e.g.,\nindividuals with schizophrenia who exhibit paranoia) may falsely attribute their symp-\ntoms to use of hallucinogens.\nOther mental disorders or medical conditions.\nOther potential disorders or conditions\nto consider include panic disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, alcohol or sedative\nwithdrawal, hypoglycemia and other metabolic conditions, seizure disorder, stroke, oph-\nthalmological disorder, and central nervous system tumors. Careful history of drug tak-\ning, collateral reports from family and friends (if possible), age, clinical history, physical\nexamination, and toxicology reports should be useful in arriving at the final diagnostic de-\ncision.", "comorbidity": "Adolescents who use MDMA/ecstasy and other hallucinogens, as well as adults who have\nrecently used ecstasy, have a higher prevalence of other substance use disorders compared\nwith nonhallucinogen substance users. Individuals who use hallucinogens exhibit eleva-\ntions of nonsubstance mental disorders (especially anxiety, depressive, and bipolar disor-\nders), particularly with use of ecstasy and salvia. Rates of antisocial personality disorder (but\nnot conduct disorder) are significantly elevated among individuals with other hallucinogen\nuse disorder, as are rates of adult antisocial behavior. However, it is unclear whether the\nmental illnesses may be precursors to rather than consequences of other hallucinogen use\ndisorder (see the section “Risk and Prognostic Factors” for this disorder). Both adults and\nadolescents who use ecstasy are more likely than other drug users to be polydrug users and\nto have other drug use disorders."}, "provenance": {"source_file": "substance_related_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 14, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.596325"}}
