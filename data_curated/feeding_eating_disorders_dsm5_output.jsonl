The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances is inappropriate to the developmental\nlevel of the individual. \nC. The eating behavior is not part of a culturally supported or socially normative practice.\nD. If the eating behavior occurs in the context of another mental disorder (e.g., intellectual\ndisability [intellectual developmental disorder], autism spectrum disorder, schizophre-\nnia) or medical condition (including pregnancy), it is sufficiently severe to warrant ad-\nditional clinical attention.\n330\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\nCoding note: The ICD-9-CM code for pica is 307.52 and is used for children or adults.\nThe ICD-10-CM codes for pica are (F98.3) in children and (F50.8) in adults.\nSpecify if:\nIn remission: After full criteria for pica were previously met, the criteria have not been\nmet for a sustained period of time.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of pica is the eating of one or more nonnutritive, nonfood substances on a\npersistent basis over a period of at least 1 month (Criterion A) that is severe enough to warrant\nclinical attention. Typical substances ingested tend to vary with age and availability and might\ninclude paper, soap, cloth, hair, string, wool, soil, chalk, talcum powder, paint, gum, metal,\npebbles, charcoal or coal, ash, clay, starch, or ice. The term nonfood is included because the di-\nagnosis of pica does not apply to ingestion of diet products that have minimal nutritional con-\ntent. There is typically no aversion to food in general. The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood\nsubstances must be developmentally inappropriate (Criterion B) and not part of a culturally\nsupported or socially normative practice (Criterion C). A minimum age of 2 years is suggested\nfor a pica diagnosis to exclude developmentally normal mouthing of objects by infants that re-\nsults in ingestion. The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances can be an associated feature\nof other mental disorders (e.g., intellectual disability [intellectual developmental disorder],\nautism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia). If the eating behavior occurs exclusively in the con-\ntext of another mental disorder, a separate diagnosis of pica should be made only if the eating\nbehavior is sufficiently severe to warrant additional clinical attention (Criterion D).\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nAlthough deficiencies in vitamins or minerals (e.g., zinc, iron) have been reported in some\ninstances, often no specific biological abnormalities are found. In some cases, pica comes\nto clinical attention only following general medical complications (e.g., mechanical bowel\nproblems; intestinal obstruction, such as that resulting from a bezoar; intestinal perfora-\ntion; infections such as toxoplasmosis and toxocariasis as a result of ingesting feces or dirt;\npoisoning, such as by ingestion of lead-based paint).\nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of pica is unclear. Among individuals with intellectual disability, the prev-\nalence of pica appears to increase with the severity of the condition.\nDevelopment and Course\nOnset of pica can occur in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood, although childhood onset\nis most commonly reported. Pica can occur in otherwise normally developing children,\nwhereas in adults, it appears more likely to occur in the context of intellectual disability or\nother mental disorders. The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances may also manifest\nin pregnancy, when specific cravings (e.g., chalk or ice) might occur. The diagnosis of pica\nduring pregnancy is only appropriate if such cravings lead to the ingestion of nonnutri-\ntive, nonfood substances to the extent that the eating of these substances poses potential\nmedical risks. The course of the disorder can be protracted and can result in medical emer-\ngencies (e.g., intestinal obstruction, acute weight loss, poisoning). The disorder can poten-\ntially be fatal depending on substances ingested.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nEnvironmental.\nNeglect, lack of supervision, and developmental delay can increase the\nrisk for this condition.\nPica\n331\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nIn some populations, the eating of earth or other seemingly nonnutritive substances is believed\nto be of spiritual, medicinal, or other social value, or may be a culturally supported or socially\nnormative practice. Such behavior does not warrant a diagnosis of pica (Criterion C).\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nPica occurs in both males and females. It can occur in females during pregnancy; however,\nlittle is known about the course of pica in the postpartum period. \nDiagnostic Markers\nAbdominal flat plate radiography, ultrasound, and other scanning methods may reveal\nobstructions related to pica. Blood tests and other laboratory tests can be used to ascertain\nlevels of poisoning or the nature of infection. \nFunctional Consequences of Pica\nPica can significantly impair physical functioning, but it is rarely the sole cause of impair-\nment in social functioning. Pica often occurs with other disorders associated with im-\npaired social functioning.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nEating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances may occur during the course of other mental\ndisorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia) and in Kleine-Levin syndrome.\nIn any such instance, an additional diagnosis of pica should be given only if the eating be-\nhavior is sufficiently persistent and severe to warrant additional clinical attention.\nAnorexia nervosa.\nPica can usually be distinguished from the other feeding and eating\ndisorders by the consumption of nonnutritive, nonfood substances. It is important to note,\nhowever, that some presentations of anorexia nervosa include ingestion of nonnutritive,\nnonfood substances, such as paper tissues, as a means of attempting to control appetite. In\nsuch cases, when the eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances is primarily used as a\nmeans of weight control, anorexia nervosa should be the primary diagnosis. \nFactitious disorder.\nSome individuals with factitious disorder may intentionally ingest\nforeign objects as part of the pattern of falsification of physical symptoms. In such in-\nstances, there is an element of deception that is consistent with deliberate induction of in-\njury or disease. \nNonsuicidal self-injury and nonsuicidal self-injury behaviors in personality disorders.\nSome individuals may swallow potentially harmful items (e.g., pins, needles, knives) in\nthe context of maladaptive behavior patterns associated with personality disorders or\nnonsuicidal self-injury. \nComorbidity\nDisorders most commonly comorbid with pica are autism spectrum disorder and intellec-\ntual disability (intellectual developmental disorder), and, to a lesser degree, schizophrenia\nand obsessive-compulsive disorder. Pica can be associated with trichotillomania (hair-\npulling disorder) and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder. In comorbid presentations, the\nhair or skin is typically ingested. Pica can also be associated with avoidant/restrictive food\nintake disorder, particularly in individuals with a strong sensory component to their pre-\nsentation. When an individual is known to have pica, assessment should include con-\nsideration of the possibility of gastrointestinal complications, poisoning, infection, and\nnutritional deficiency. \n332\nFeeding and Eating Disorders", "provenance": {"source_file": "feeding_eating_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 1, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.462383"}}

Previously swal-\nlowed food that may be partially digested is brought up into the mouth without apparent\nnausea, involuntary retching, or disgust. The food may be re-chewed and then ejected\nfrom the mouth or re-swallowed. Regurgitation in rumination disorder should be fre-\nquent, occurring at least several times per week, typically daily. The behavior is not better\nexplained by an associated gastrointestinal or other medical condition (e.g., gastroesoph-\nageal reflux, pyloric stenosis) (Criterion B) and does not occur exclusively during the\ncourse of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, or avoidant/restric-\ntive food intake disorder (Criterion C). If the symptoms occur in the context of another\nmental disorder (e.g., intellectual disability [intellectual developmental disorder], neuro-\ndevelopmental disorder), they must be sufficiently severe to warrant additional clinical\nattention (Criterion D) and should represent a primary aspect of the individual’s presen-\ntation requiring intervention. The disorder may be diagnosed across the life span, par-\nticularly in individuals who also have intellectual disability. Many individuals with\nrumination disorder can be directly observed engaging in the behavior by the clinician. In\nother instances diagnosis can be made on the basis of self-report or corroborative informa-\ntion from parents or caregivers. Individuals may describe the behavior as habitual or out-\nside of their control.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nInfants with rumination disorder display a characteristic position of straining and arching\nthe back with the head held back, making sucking movements with their tongue. They\nmay give the impression of gaining satisfaction from the activity. They may be irritable\nand hungry between episodes of regurgitation. Weight loss and failure to make expected\nweight gains are common features in infants with rumination disorder. Malnutrition may\noccur despite the infant’s apparent hunger and the ingestion of relatively large amounts of\nfood, particularly in severe cases, when regurgitation immediately follows each feeding\nepisode and regurgitated food is expelled. Malnutrition might also occur in older children\nand adults, particularly when the regurgitation is accompanied by restriction of intake.\nAdolescents and adults may attempt to disguise the regurgitation behavior by placing a\nRumination Disorder\n333\nhand over the mouth or coughing. Some will avoid eating with others because of the ac-\nknowledged social undesirability of the behavior. This may extend to an avoidance of eat-\ning prior to social situations, such as work or school (e.g., avoiding breakfast because it\nmay be followed by regurgitation).\nPrevalence\nPrevalence data for rumination disorder are inconclusive, but the disorder is commonly\nreported to be higher in certain groups, such as individuals with intellectual disability.\nDevelopment and Course\nOnset of rumination disorder can occur in infancy, childhood, adolescence, or adulthood.\nThe age at onset in infants is usually between ages 3 and 12 months. In infants, the disorder\nfrequently remits spontaneously, but its course can be protracted and can result in medical\nemergencies (e.g., severe malnutrition). It can potentially be fatal, particularly in infancy.\nRumination disorder can have an episodic course or occur continuously until treated. In\ninfants, as well as in older individuals with intellectual disability (intellectual developmen-\ntal disorder) or other neurodevelopmental disorders, the regurgitation and rumination be-\nhavior appears to have a self-soothing or self-stimulating function, similar to that of other\nrepetitive motor behaviors such as head banging. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nEnvironmental.\nPsychosocial problems such as lack of stimulation, neglect, stressful life\nsituations, and problems in the parent-child relationship may be predisposing factors in\ninfants and young children.\nFunctional Consequences of Rumination Disorder\nMalnutrition secondary to repeated regurgitation may be associated with growth delay\nand have a negative effect on development and learning potential. Some older individuals\nwith rumination disorder deliberately restrict their food intake because of the social un-\ndesirability of regurgitation. They may therefore present with weight loss or low weight.\nIn older children, adolescents, and adults, social functioning is more likely to be adversely\naffected. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nGastrointestinal conditions.\nIt is important to differentiate regurgitation in rumination\ndisorder from other conditions characterized by gastroesophageal reflux or vomiting. Con-\nditions such as gastroparesis, pyloric stenosis, hiatal hernia, and Sandifer syndrome in in-\nfants should be ruled out by appropriate physical examinations and laboratory tests.\nAnorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.\nIndividuals with anorexia nervosa and bulimia\nnervosa may also engage in regurgitation with subsequent spitting out of food as a means\nof disposing of ingested calories because of concerns about weight gain. \nComorbidity\nRegurgitation with associated rumination can occur in the context of a concurrent medical\ncondition or another mental disorder (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder). When the regur-\ngitation occurs in this context, a diagnosis of rumination disorder is appropriate only when\nthe severity of the disturbance exceeds that routinely associated with such conditions or\ndisorders and warrants additional clinical attention.\n334\nFeeding and Eating Disorders", "provenance": {"source_file": "feeding_eating_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 2, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.462383"}}

An eating or feeding disturbance (e.g., apparent lack of interest in eating or food; avoid-\nance based on the sensory characteristics of food; concern about aversive conse-\nquences of eating) as manifested by persistent failure to meet appropriate nutritional\nand/or energy needs associated with one (or more) of the following:\n1. Significant weight loss (or failure to achieve expected weight gain or faltering\ngrowth in children).\n2. Significant nutritional deficiency.\n3. Dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements.\n4. Marked interference with psychosocial functioning.\nB. The disturbance is not better explained by lack of available food or by an associated\nculturally sanctioned practice.\nC. The eating disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia ner-\nvosa or bulimia nervosa, and there is no evidence of a disturbance in the way in which\none’s body weight or shape is experienced.\nD. The eating disturbance is not attributable to a concurrent medical condition or not bet-\nter explained by another mental disorder. When the eating disturbance occurs in the\ncontext of another condition or disorder, the severity of the eating disturbance exceeds\nthat routinely associated with the condition or disorder and warrants additional clinical\nattention.\nSpecify if:\nIn remission: After full criteria for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder were previ-\nously met, the criteria have not been met for a sustained period of time.\nDiagnostic Features\nAvoidant/restrictive food intake disorder replaces and extends the DSM-IV diagnosis of\nfeeding disorder of infancy or early childhood. The main diagnostic feature of avoidant/\nrestrictive food intake disorder is avoidance or restriction of food intake (Criterion A)\nmanifested by clinically significant failure to meet requirements for nutrition or insuffi-\ncient energy intake through oral intake of food. One or more of the following key features\nmust be present: significant weight loss, significant nutritional deficiency (or related\nhealth impact), dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements, or marked\ninterference with psychosocial functioning. The determination of whether weight loss is\nsignificant (Criterion A1) is a clinical judgment; instead of losing weight, children and ad-\nolescents who have not completed growth may not maintain weight or height increases\nalong their developmental trajectory.\nDetermination of significant nutritional deficiency (Criterion A2) is also based on clin-\nical assessment (e.g., assessment of dietary intake, physical examination, and laboratory\ntesting), and related impact on physical health can be of a similar severity to that seen in\nanorexia nervosa (e.g., hypothermia, bradycardia, anemia). In severe cases, particularly in\ninfants, malnutrition can be life threatening. “Dependence” on enteral feeding or oral nu-\ntritional supplements (Criterion A3) means that supplementary feeding is required to sus-\ntain adequate intake. Examples of individuals requiring supplementary feeding include\ninfants with failure to thrive who require nasogastric tube feeding, children with neuro-\ndevelopmental disorders who are dependent on nutritionally complete supplements, and\nindividuals who rely on gastrostomy tube feeding or complete oral nutrition supplements\nin the absence of an underlying medical condition. Inability to participate in normal social\nAvoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder\n335\nactivities, such as eating with others, or to sustain relationships as a result of the distur-\nbance would indicate marked interference with psychosocial functioning (Criterion A4).\nAvoidant/restrictive food intake disorder does not include avoidance or restriction of\nfood intake related to lack of availability of food or to cultural practices (e.g., religious fast-\ning or normal dieting) (Criterion B), nor does it include developmentally normal behaviors\n(e.g., picky eating in toddlers, reduced intake in older adults). The disturbance is not better\nexplained by excessive concern about body weight or shape (Criterion C) or by concurrent\nmedical factors or mental disorders (Criterion D). \nIn some individuals, food avoidance or restriction may be based on the sensory char-\nacteristics of qualities of food, such as extreme sensitivity to appearance, color, smell,\ntexture, temperature, or taste. Such behavior has been described as “restrictive eating,”\n“selective eating,” “choosy eating,” “perseverant eating,” “chronic food refusal,” and\n“food neophobia” and may manifest as refusal to eat particular brands of foods or to tol-\nerate the smell of food being eaten by others. Individuals with heightened sensory sensi-\ntivities associated with autism may show similar behaviors. \nFood avoidance or restriction may also represent a conditioned negative response as-\nsociated with food intake following, or in anticipation of, an aversive experience, such as\nchoking; a traumatic investigation, usually involving the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., esoph-\nagoscopy); or repeated vomiting. The terms functional dysphagia and globus hystericus have\nalso been used for such conditions. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis \nSeveral features may be associated with food avoidance or reduced food intake, including\na lack of interest in eating or food, leading to weight loss or faltering growth. Very young\ninfants may present as being too sleepy, distressed, or agitated to feed. Infants and young\nchildren may not engage with the primary caregiver during feeding or communicate hun-\nger in favor of other activities. In older children and adolescents, food avoidance or restric-\ntion may be associated with more generalized emotional difficulties that do not meet\ndiagnostic criteria for an anxiety, depressive, or bipolar disorder, sometimes called “food\navoidance emotional disorder.” \nDevelopment and Course\nFood avoidance or restriction associated with insufficient intake or lack of interest in eat-\ning most commonly develops in infancy or early childhood and may persist in adulthood.\nLikewise, avoidance based on sensory characteristics of food tends to arise in the first de-\ncade of life but may persist into adulthood. Avoidance related to aversive consequences\ncan arise at any age. The scant literature regarding long-term outcomes suggests that food\navoidance or restriction based on sensory aspects is relatively stable and long-standing,\nbut when persisting into adulthood, such avoidance/restriction can be associated with rel-\natively normal functioning. There is currently insufficient evidence directly linking avoid-\nant/restrictive food intake disorder and subsequent onset of an eating disorder. \nInfants with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder may be irritable and difficult to\nconsole during feeding, or may appear apathetic and withdrawn. In some instances, par-\nent-child interaction may contribute to the infant’s feeding problem (e.g., presenting food\ninappropriately, or interpreting the infant’s behavior as an act of aggression or rejection).\nInadequate nutritional intake may exacerbate the associated features (e.g., irritability, de-\nvelopmental lags) and further contribute to feeding difficulties. Associated factors include\ninfant temperament or developmental impairments that reduce an infant’s responsiveness\nto feeding. Coexisting parental psychopathology, or child abuse or neglect, is suggested if\nfeeding and weight improve in response to changing caregivers. In infants, children, and\nprepubertal adolescents, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder may be associated with\ngrowth delay, and the resulting malnutrition negatively affects development and learning\n336\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\npotential. In older children, adolescents, and adults, social functioning tends to be ad-\nversely affected. Regardless of the age, family function may be affected, with heightened\nstress at mealtimes and in other feeding or eating contexts involving friends and relatives.\nAvoidant/restrictive food intake disorder manifests more commonly in children than\nin adults, and there may be a long delay between onset and clinical presentation. Triggers\nfor presentation vary considerably and include physical, social, and emotional difficulties.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nTemperamental.\nAnxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorder, obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may increase risk for avoidant or\nrestrictive feeding or eating behavior characteristic of the disorder. \nEnvironmental.\nEnvironmental risk factors for avoidant/restrictive food intake disor-\nder include familial anxiety. Higher rates of feeding disturbances may occur in children of\nmothers with eating disorders. \nGenetic and physiological.\nHistory of gastrointestinal conditions, gastroesophageal re-\nflux disease, vomiting, and a range of other medical problems has been associated with\nfeeding and eating behaviors characteristic of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nPresentations similar to avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder occur in various popu-\nlations, including in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe. Avoidant/restrictive\nfood intake disorder should not be diagnosed when avoidance of food intake is solely re-\nlated to specific religious or cultural practices.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nAvoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is equally common in males and females in in-\nfancy and early childhood, but avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder comorbid with\nautism spectrum disorder has a male predominance. Food avoidance or restriction related\nto altered sensory sensitivities can occur in some physiological conditions, most notably\npregnancy, but is not usually extreme and does not meet full criteria for the disorder.\nDiagnostic Markers\nDiagnostic markers include malnutrition, low weight, growth delay, and the need for ar-\ntificial nutrition in the absence of any clear medical condition other than poor intake.\nFunctional Consequences of Avoidant/Restrictive \nFood Intake Disorder\nAssociated developmental and functional limitations include impairment of physical de-\nvelopment and social difficulties that can have a significant negative impact on family\nfunction. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nAppetite loss preceding restricted intake is a nonspecific symptom that can accompany a\nnumber of mental diagnoses. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder can be diagnosed\nconcurrently with the disorders below if all criteria are met, and the eating disturbance re-\nquires specific clinical attention. \nOther medical conditions (e.g., gastrointestinal disease, food allergies and intoler-\nances, occult malignancies).\nRestriction of food intake may occur in other medical condi-\nAvoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder\n337\ntions, especially those with ongoing symptoms such as vomiting, loss of appetite, nausea, ab-\ndominal pain, or diarrhea. A diagnosis of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder requires\nthat the disturbance of intake is beyond that directly accounted for by physical symptoms con-\nsistent with a medical condition; the eating disturbance may also persist after being triggered\nby a medical condition and following resolution of the medical condition. \nUnderlying medical or comorbid mental conditions may complicate feeding and eating.\nBecause older individuals, postsurgical patients, and individuals receiving chemotherapy\noften lose their appetite, an additional diagnosis of avoidant/restrictive food intake dis-\norder requires that the eating disturbance is a primary focus for intervention. \nSpecific neurological/neuromuscular, structural, or congenital disorders and condi-\ntions associated with feeding difficulties.\nFeeding difficulties are common in a number\nof congenital and neurological conditions often related to problems with oral/esophageal/\npharyngeal structure and function, such as hypotonia of musculature, tongue protrusion,\nand unsafe swallowing. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder can be diagnosed in in-\ndividuals with such presentations as long as all diagnostic criteria are met.\nReactive attachment disorder.\nSome degree of withdrawal is characteristic of reactive\nattachment disorder and can lead to a disturbance in the caregiver-child relationship that\ncan affect feeding and the child’s intake. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should\nbe diagnosed concurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and the feeding\ndisturbance is a primary focus for intervention.\nAutism spectrum disorder.\nIndividuals with autism spectrum disorder often present with\nrigid eating behaviors and heightened sensory sensitivities. However, these features do\nnot always result in the level of impairment that would be required for a diagnosis of\navoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should\nbe diagnosed concurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and when the eat-\ning disturbance requires specific treatment.\nSpecific phobia, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), and other anxiety disorders.\nSpecific phobia, other type, specifies “situations that may lead to choking or vomiting” and\ncan represent the primary trigger for the fear, anxiety, or avoidance required for diagnosis.\nDistinguishing specific phobia from avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder can be dif-\nficult when a fear of choking or vomiting has resulted in food avoidance. Although avoid-\nance or restriction of food intake secondary to a pronounced fear of choking or vomiting\ncan be conceptualized as specific phobia, in situations when the eating problem becomes\nthe primary focus of clinical attention, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder becomes\nthe appropriate diagnosis. In social anxiety disorder, the individual may present with a\nfear of being observed by others while eating, which can also occur in avoidant/restrictive\nfood intake disorder. \nAnorexia nervosa.\nRestriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to sig-\nnificantly low body weight is a core feature of anorexia nervosa. However, individuals\nwith anorexia nervosa also display a fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persis-\ntent behavior that interferes with weight gain, as well as specific disturbances in relation to\nperception and experience of their own body weight and shape. These features are not\npresent in avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, and the two disorders should not be\ndiagnosed concurrently. Differential diagnosis between avoidant/restrictive food intake\ndisorder and anorexia nervosa may be difficult, especially in late childhood and early ad-\nolescence, because these disorders may share a number of common symptoms (e.g., food\navoidance, low weight). Differential diagnosis is also potentially difficult in individuals\nwith anorexia nervosa who deny any fear of fatness but nonetheless engage in persistent\nbehaviors that prevent weight gain and who do not recognize the medical seriousness of\ntheir low weight—a presentation sometimes termed “non-fat phobic anorexia nervosa.”\nFull consideration of symptoms, course, and family history is advised, and diagnosis may\n338\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\nbe best made in the context of a clinical relationship over time. In some individuals, avoid-\nant/restrictive food intake disorder might precede the onset of anorexia nervosa.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nIndividuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder may\npresent with avoidance or restriction of intake in relation to preoccupations with food or\nritualized eating behavior. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should be diagnosed\nconcurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and when the aberrant eating is\na major aspect of the clinical presentation requiring specific intervention.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nIn major depressive disorder, appetite might be affected to\nsuch an extent that individuals present with significantly restricted food intake, usually in\nrelation to overall energy intake and often associated with weight loss. Usually appetite\nloss and related reduction of intake abate with resolution of mood problems. Avoidant/\nrestrictive food intake disorder should only be used concurrently if full criteria are met for\nboth disorders and when the eating disturbance requires specific treatment.\nSchizophrenia spectrum disorders.\nIndividuals with schizophrenia, delusional disor-\nder, or other psychotic disorders may exhibit odd eating behaviors, avoidance of specific\nfoods because of delusional beliefs, or other manifestations of avoidant or restrictive in-\ntake. In some cases, delusional beliefs may contribute to a concern about negative conse-\nquences of ingesting certain foods. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should be\nused concurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and when the eating dis-\nturbance requires specific treatment.\nFactitious disorder or factitious disorder imposed on another.\nAvoidant/restrictive\nfood intake disorder should be differentiated from factitious disorder or factitious disor-\nder imposed on another. In order to assume the sick role, some individuals with factitious\ndisorder may intentionally describe diets that are much more restrictive than those they\nare actually able to consume, as well as complications of such behavior, such as a need for\nenteral feedings or nutritional supplements, an inability to tolerate a normal range of\nfoods, and/or an inability to participate normally in age-appropriate situations involving\nfood. The presentation may be impressively dramatic and engaging, and the symptoms re-\nported inconsistently. In factitious disorder imposed on another, the caregiver describes\nsymptoms consistent with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder and may induce\nphysical symptoms such as failure to gain weight. As with any diagnosis of factitious dis-\norder imposed on another, the caregiver receives the diagnosis rather than the affected in-\ndividual, and diagnosis should be made only on the basis of a careful, comprehensive\nassessment of the affected individual, the caregiver, and their interaction. \nComorbidity\nThe most commonly observed disorders comorbid with avoidant/restrictive food intake\ndisorder are anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and neurodevelopmental\ndisorders (specifically autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disor-\nder, and intellectual disability [intellectual developmental disorder]).", "provenance": {"source_file": "feeding_eating_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 3, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.462383"}}

The level of severity may be in-\ncreased to reflect clinical symptoms, the degree of functional disability, and the need for\nsupervision.\nMild: BMI ≥ 17 kg/m2 \nModerate: BMI 16–16.99 kg/m2 \nSevere: BMI 15–15.99 kg/m2 \nExtreme: BMI < 15 kg/m2\nSubtypes\nMost individuals with the binge-eating/purging type of anorexia nervosa who binge eat\nalso purge through self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas.\nSome individuals with this subtype of anorexia nervosa do not binge eat but do regularly\npurge after the consumption of small amounts of food. \nCrossover between the subtypes over the course of the disorder is not uncommon;\ntherefore, subtype description should be used to describe current symptoms rather than\nlongitudinal course.\nDiagnostic Features\nThere are three essential features of anorexia nervosa: persistent energy intake restriction;\nintense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes\nwith weight gain; and a disturbance in self-perceived weight or shape. The individual main-\ntains a body weight that is below a minimally normal level for age, sex, developmental tra-\njectory, and physical health (Criterion A). Individuals’ body weights frequently meet this\ncriterion following a significant weight loss, but among children and adolescents, there\nmay alternatively be failure to make expected weight gain or to maintain a normal devel-\nopmental trajectory (i.e., while growing in height) instead of weight loss.\n340\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\nCriterion A requires that the individual’s weight be significantly low (i.e., less than\nminimally normal or, for children and adolescents, less than that minimally expected).\nWeight assessment can be challenging because normal weight range differs among indi-\nviduals, and different thresholds have been published defining thinness or underweight\nstatus. Body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms/height in meters2) is a\nuseful measure to assess body weight for height. For adults, a BMI of 18.5 kg/m2 has been\nemployed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) as the lower limit of normal body weight. Therefore, most adults with\na BMI greater than or equal to 18.5 kg/m2 would not be considered to have a significantly\nlow body weight. On the other hand, a BMI of lower than 17.0 kg/m2 has been considered\nby the WHO to indicate moderate or severe thinness; therefore, an individual with a BMI\nless than 17.0 kg/m2 would likely be considered to have a significantly low weight. An\nadult with a BMI between 17.0 and 18.5 kg/m2, or even above 18.5 kg/m2, might be consid-\nered to have a significantly low weight if clinical history or other physiological informa-\ntion supports this judgment.\nFor children and adolescents, determining a BMI-for-age percentile is useful (see, e.g.,\nthe CDC BMI percentile calculator for children and teenagers. As for adults, it is not pos-\nsible to provide definitive standards for judging whether a child’s or an adolescent’s weight\nis significantly low, and variations in developmental trajectories among youth limit the\nutility of simple numerical guidelines. The CDC has used a BMI-for-age below the 5th per-\ncentile as suggesting underweight; however, children and adolescents with a BMI above\nthis benchmark may be judged to be significantly underweight in light of failure to main-\ntain their expected growth trajectory. In summary, in determining whether Criterion A is\nmet, the clinician should consider available numerical guidelines, as well as the individual’s\nbody build, weight history, and any physiological disturbances.\nIndividuals with this disorder typically display an intense fear of gaining weight or of\nbecoming fat (Criterion B). This intense fear of becoming fat is usually not alleviated by\nweight loss. In fact, concern about weight gain may increase even as weight falls. Younger\nindividuals with anorexia nervosa, as well as some adults, may not recognize or acknowl-\nedge a fear of weight gain. In the absence of another explanation for the significantly low\nweight, clinician inference drawn from collateral history, observational data, physical and\nlaboratory findings, or longitudinal course either indicating a fear of weight gain or sup-\nporting persistent behaviors that prevent it may be used to establish Criterion B. \nThe experience and significance of body weight and shape are distorted in these indi-\nviduals (Criterion C). Some individuals feel globally overweight. Others realize that they\nare thin but are still concerned that certain body parts, particularly the abdomen, buttocks,\nand thighs, are “too fat.” They may employ a variety of techniques to evaluate their body\nsize or weight, including frequent weighing, obsessive measuring of body parts, and per-\nsistent use of a mirror to check for perceived areas of “fat.” The self-esteem of individuals\nwith anorexia nervosa is highly dependent on their perceptions of body shape and weight.\nWeight loss is often viewed as an impressive achievement and a sign of extraordinary self-\ndiscipline, whereas weight gain is perceived as an unacceptable failure of self-control. Al-\nthough some individuals with this disorder may acknowledge being thin, they often do\nnot recognize the serious medical implications of their malnourished state. \nOften, the individual is brought to professional attention by family members after marked\nweight loss (or failure to make expected weight gains) has occurred. If individuals seek help\non their own, it is usually because of distress over the somatic and psychological sequelae\nof starvation. It is rare for an individual with anorexia nervosa to complain of weight loss\nper se. In fact, individuals with anorexia nervosa frequently either lack insight into or deny\nthe problem. It is therefore often important to obtain information from family members or\nother sources to evaluate the history of weight loss and other features of the illness.\nAnorexia Nervosa\n341\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nThe semi-starvation of anorexia nervosa, and the purging behaviors sometimes associated\nwith it, can result in significant and potentially life-threatening medical conditions. The\nnutritional compromise associated with this disorder affects most major organ systems\nand can produce a variety of disturbances. Physiological disturbances, including amenor-\nrhea and vital sign abnormalities, are common. While most of the physiological distur-\nbances associated with malnutrition are reversible with nutritional rehabilitation, some,\nincluding loss of bone mineral density, are often not completely reversible. Behaviors such\nas self-induced vomiting and misuse of laxatives, diuretics, and enemas may cause a num-\nber of disturbances that lead to abnormal laboratory findings; however, some individuals\nwith anorexia nervosa exhibit no laboratory abnormalities. \nWhen seriously underweight, many individuals with anorexia nervosa have depressive\nsigns and symptoms such as depressed mood, social withdrawal, irritability, insomnia, and\ndiminished interest in sex. Because these features are also observed in individuals without\nanorexia nervosa who are significantly undernourished, many of the depressive features\nmay be secondary to the physiological sequelae of semi-starvation, although they may also\nbe sufficiently severe to warrant an additional diagnosis of major depressive disorder. \nObsessive-compulsive features, both related and unrelated to food, are often prominent.\nMost individuals with anorexia nervosa are preoccupied with thoughts of food. Some col-\nlect recipes or hoard food. Observations of behaviors associated with other forms of star-\nvation suggest that obsessions and compulsions related to food may be exacerbated by\nundernutrition. When individuals with anorexia nervosa exhibit obsessions and compul-\nsions that are not related to food, body shape, or weight, an additional diagnosis of obses-\nsive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may be warranted.\nOther features sometimes associated with anorexia nervosa include concerns about\neating in public, feelings of ineffectiveness, a strong desire to control one’s environment,\ninflexible thinking, limited social spontaneity, and overly restrained emotional ex-\npression. Compared with individuals with anorexia nervosa, restricting type, those with\nbinge-eating/purging type have higher rates of impulsivity and are more likely to abuse\nalcohol and other drugs. \nA subgroup of individuals with anorexia nervosa show excessive levels of physical ac-\ntivity. Increases in physical activity often precede onset of the disorder, and over the\ncourse of the disorder increased activity accelerates weight loss. During treatment, exces-\nsive activity may be difficult to control, thereby jeopardizing weight recovery.\nIndividuals with anorexia nervosa may misuse medications, such as by manipulating\ndosage, in order to achieve weight loss or avoid weight gain. Individuals with diabetes\nmellitus may omit or reduce insulin doses in order to minimize carbohydrate metabolism. \nPrevalence\nThe 12-month prevalence of anorexia nervosa among young females is approximately\n0.4%. Less is known about prevalence among males, but anorexia nervosa is far less com-\nmon in males than in females, with clinical populations generally reflecting approximately\na 10:1 female-to-male ratio. \nDevelopment and Course\nAnorexia nervosa commonly begins during adolescence or young adulthood. It rarely be-\ngins before puberty or after age 40, but cases of both early and late onset have been de-\nscribed. The onset of this disorder is often associated with a stressful life event, such as\nleaving home for college. The course and outcome of anorexia nervosa are highly variable.\nYounger individuals may manifest atypical features, including denying “fear of fat.” Older\n342\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\nindividuals more likely have a longer duration of illness, and their clinical presentation may\ninclude more signs and symptoms of long-standing disorder. Clinicians should not exclude\nanorexia nervosa from the differential diagnosis solely on the basis of older age.\nMany individuals have a period of changed eating behavior prior to full criteria for the\ndisorder being met. Some individuals with anorexia nervosa recover fully after a single\nepisode, with some exhibiting a fluctuating pattern of weight gain followed by relapse,\nand others experiencing a chronic course over many years. Hospitalization may be re-\nquired to restore weight and to address medical complications. Most individuals with an-\norexia nervosa experience remission within 5 years of presentation. Among individuals\nadmitted to hospitals, overall remission rates may be lower. The crude mortality rate (CMR)\nfor anorexia nervosa is approximately 5% per decade. Death most commonly results from\nmedical complications associated with the disorder itself or from suicide.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nTemperamental.\nIndividuals who develop anxiety disorders or display obsessional\ntraits in childhood are at increased risk of developing anorexia nervosa.\nEnvironmental.\nHistorical and cross-cultural variability in the prevalence of anorexia\nnervosa supports its association with cultures and settings in which thinness is valued. Oc-\ncupations and avocations that encourage thinness, such as modeling and elite athletics, are\nalso associated with increased risk. \nGenetic and physiological.\nThere is an increased risk of anorexia nervosa and bulimia\nnervosa among first-degree biological relatives of individuals with the disorder. An in-\ncreased risk of bipolar and depressive disorders has also been found among first-degree\nrelatives of individuals with anorexia nervosa, particularly relatives of individuals with\nthe binge-eating/purging type. Concordance rates for anorexia nervosa in monozygotic\ntwins are significantly higher than those for dizygotic twins. A range of brain abnormali-\nties has been described in anorexia nervosa using functional imaging technologies (func-\ntional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography). The degree to which\nthese findings reflect changes associated with malnutrition versus primary abnormalities\nassociated with the disorder is unclear.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nAnorexia nervosa occurs across culturally and socially diverse populations, although available\nevidence suggests cross-cultural variation in its occurrence and presentation. Anorexia ner-\nvosa is probably most prevalent in post-industrialized, high-income countries such as in the\nUnited States, many European countries, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, but its incidence\nin most low- and middle-income countries is uncertain. Whereas the prevalence of anorexia\nnervosa appears comparatively low among Latinos, African Americans, and Asians in the\nUnited States, clinicians should be aware that mental health service utilization among individ-\nuals with an eating disorder is significantly lower in these ethnic groups and that the low rates\nmay reflect an ascertainment bias. The presentation of weight concerns among individuals\nwith eating and feeding disorders varies substantially across cultural contexts. The absence of\nan expressed intense fear of weight gain, sometimes referred to as “fat phobia,” appears to be\nrelatively more common in populations in Asia, where the rationale for dietary restriction is\ncommonly related to a more culturally sanctioned complaint such as gastrointestinal discom-\nfort. Within the United States, presentations without a stated intense fear of weight gain may\nbe comparatively more common among Latino groups.\nDiagnostic Markers\nThe following laboratory abnormalities may be observed in anorexia nervosa; their pres-\nence may serve to increase diagnostic confidence. \nAnorexia Nervosa\n343\nHematology.\nLeukopenia is common, with the loss of all cell types but usually with ap-\nparent lymphocytosis. Mild anemia can occur, as well as thrombocytopenia and, rarely,\nbleeding problems. \nSerum chemistry.\nDehydration may be reflected by an elevated blood urea nitrogen\nlevel. Hypercholesterolemia is common. Hepatic enzyme levels may be elevated. Hypo-\nmagnesemia, hypozincemia, hypophosphatemia, and hyperamylasemia are occasionally\nobserved. Self-induced vomiting may lead to metabolic alkalosis (elevated serum bicarbon-\nate), hypochloremia, and hypokalemia; laxative abuse may cause a mild metabolic acidosis. \nEndocrine.\nSerum thyroxine (T4) levels are usually in the low-normal range; triiodothy-\nronine (T3) levels are decreased, while reverse T3 levels are elevated. Females have low se-\nrum estrogen levels, whereas males have low levels of serum testosterone.\nElectrocardiography.\nSinus bradycardia is common, and, rarely, arrhythmias are noted.\nSignificant prolongation of the QTc interval is observed in some individuals. \nBone mass.\nLow bone mineral density, with specific areas of osteopenia or osteoporo-\nsis, is often seen. The risk of fracture is significantly elevated.\nElectroencephalography.\nDiffuse abnormalities, reflecting a metabolic encephalopa-\nthy, may result from significant fluid and electrolyte disturbances. \nResting energy expenditure.\nThere is often a significant reduction in resting energy ex-\npenditure.\nPhysical signs and symptoms.\nMany of the physical signs and symptoms of anorexia\nnervosa are attributable to starvation. Amenorrhea is commonly present and appears to\nbe an indicator of physiological dysfunction. If present, amenorrhea is usually a conse-\nquence of the weight loss, but in a minority of individuals it may actually precede the\nweight loss. In prepubertal females, menarche may be delayed. In addition to amenorrhea,\nthere may be complaints of constipation, abdominal pain, cold intolerance, lethargy, and\nexcess energy.\nThe most remarkable finding on physical examination is emaciation. Commonly, there\nis also significant hypotension, hypothermia, and bradycardia. Some individuals develop\nlanugo, a fine downy body hair. Some develop peripheral edema, especially during\nweight restoration or upon cessation of laxative and diuretic abuse. Rarely, petechiae or\necchymoses, usually on the extremities, may indicate a bleeding diathesis. Some individ-\nuals evidence a yellowing of the skin associated with hypercarotenemia. As may be seen in\nindividuals with bulimia nervosa, individuals with anorexia nervosa who self-induce\nvomiting may have hypertrophy of the salivary glands, particularly the parotid glands, as\nwell as dental enamel erosion. Some individuals may have scars or calluses on the dorsal\nsurface of the hand from repeated contact with the teeth while inducing vomiting.\nSuicide Risk\nSuicide risk is elevated in anorexia nervosa, with rates reported as 12 per 100,000 per year.\nComprehensive evaluation of individuals with anorexia nervosa should include assess-\nment of suicide-related ideation and behaviors as well as other risk factors for suicide, in-\ncluding a history of suicide attempt(s). \nFunctional Consequences of Anorexia Nervosa\nIndividuals with anorexia nervosa may exhibit a range of functional limitations associated\nwith the disorder. While some individuals remain active in social and professional func-\ntioning, others demonstrate significant social isolation and/or failure to fulfill academic or\ncareer potential. \n344\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther possible causes of either significantly low body weight or significant weight loss\nshould be considered in the differential diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, especially when the\npresenting features are atypical (e.g., onset after age 40 years). \nMedical conditions (e.g., gastrointestinal disease, hyperthyroidism, occult malignan-\ncies, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]).\nSerious weight loss may oc-\ncur in medical conditions, but individuals with these disorders usually do not also mani-\nfest a disturbance in the way their body weight or shape is experienced or an intense fear\nof weight gain or persist in behaviors that interfere with appropriate weight gain. Acute\nweight loss associated with a medical condition can occasionally be followed by the onset\nor recurrence of anorexia nervosa, which can initially be masked by the comorbid medical\ncondition. Rarely, anorexia nervosa develops after bariatric surgery for obesity. \nMajor depressive disorder.\nIn major depressive disorder, severe weight loss may occur,\nbut most individuals with major depressive disorder do not have either a desire for exces-\nsive weight loss or an intense fear of gaining weight. \nSchizophrenia.\nIndividuals with schizophrenia may exhibit odd eating behavior and oc-\ncasionally experience significant weight loss, but they rarely show the fear of gaining\nweight and the body image disturbance required for a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. \nSubstance use disorders.\nIndividuals with substance use disorders may experience low\nweight due to poor nutritional intake but generally do not fear gaining weight and do not\nmanifest body image disturbance. Individuals who abuse substances that reduce appetite\n(e.g., cocaine, stimulants) and who also endorse fear of weight gain should be carefully\nevaluated for the possibility of comorbid anorexia nervosa, given that the substance use\nmay represent a persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain (Criterion B).\nSocial anxiety disorder (social phobia), obsessive-compulsive disorder, and body dys-\nmorphic disorder.\nSome of the features of anorexia nervosa overlap with the criteria for\nsocial phobia, OCD, and body dysmorphic disorder. Specifically, individuals may feel hu-\nmiliated or embarrassed to be seen eating in public, as in social phobia; may exhibit obses-\nsions and compulsions related to food, as in OCD; or may be preoccupied with an imagined\ndefect in bodily appearance, as in body dysmorphic disorder. If the individual with anorexia\nnervosa has social fears that are limited to eating behavior alone, the diagnosis of social pho-\nbia should not be made, but social fears unrelated to eating behavior (e.g., excessive fear of\nspeaking in public) may warrant an additional diagnosis of social phobia. Similarly, an ad-\nditional diagnosis of OCD should be considered only if the individual exhibits obsessions\nand compulsions unrelated to food (e.g., an excessive fear of contamination), and an addi-\ntional diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder should be considered only if the distortion is\nunrelated to body shape and size (e.g., preoccupation that one’s nose is too big).\nBulimia nervosa.\nIndividuals with bulimia nervosa exhibit recurrent episodes of binge\neating, engage in inappropriate behavior to avoid weight gain (e.g., self-induced vomit-\ning), and are overly concerned with body shape and weight. However, unlike individuals\nwith anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type, individuals with bulimia nervosa main-\ntain body weight at or above a minimally normal level.\nAvoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.\nIndividuals with this disorder may exhibit\nsignificant weight loss or significant nutritional deficiency, but they do not have a fear of\ngaining weight or of becoming fat, nor do they have a disturbance in the way they expe-\nrience their body shape and weight. \nComorbidity\nBipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders commonly co-occur with anorexia nervosa.\nMany individuals with anorexia nervosa report the presence of either an anxiety disorder\nBulimia Nervosa\n345\nor symptoms prior to onset of their eating disorder. OCD is described in some individuals\nwith anorexia nervosa, especially those with the restricting type. Alcohol use disorder and\nother substance use disorders may also be comorbid with anorexia nervosa, especially\namong those with the binge-eating/purging type.", "provenance": {"source_file": "feeding_eating_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 4, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.463382"}}

Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by\nboth of the following:\n1. Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), an amount of\nfood that is definitely larger than what most individuals would eat in a similar period\nof time under similar circumstances.\n2. A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that one\ncannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).\nB. Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors in order to prevent weight gain, such\nas self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications; fasting;\nor excessive exercise.\nC. The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on average,\nat least once a week for 3 months.\nD. Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight.\nE. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa.\nSpecify if:\nIn partial remission: After full criteria for bulimia nervosa were previously met, some,\nbut not all, of the criteria have been met for a sustained period of time.\nIn full remission: After full criteria for bulimia nervosa were previously met, none of\nthe criteria have been met for a sustained period of time.\nSpecify current severity:\nThe minimum level of severity is based on the frequency of inappropriate compensatory\nbehaviors (see below). The level of severity may be increased to reflect other symptoms\nand the degree of functional disability.\nMild: An average of 1–3 episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week.\nModerate: An average of 4–7 episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per\nweek.\nSevere: An average of 8–13 episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per\nweek.\nExtreme: An average of 14 or more episodes of inappropriate compensatory behav-\niors per week.\nDiagnostic Features\nThere are three essential features of bulimia nervosa: recurrent episodes of binge eating\n(Criterion A), recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain\n(Criterion B), and self-evaluation that is unduly influenced by body shape and weight\n(Criterion D). To qualify for the diagnosis, the binge eating and inappropriate compensa-\ntory behaviors must occur, on average, at least once per week for 3 months (Criterion C).\nAn “episode of binge eating” is defined as eating, in a discrete period of time, an\namount of food that is definitely larger than most individuals would eat in a similar period\nof time under similar circumstances (Criterion A1). The context in which the eating occurs\n346\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\nmay affect the clinician’s estimation of whether the intake is excessive. For example, a\nquantity of food that might be regarded as excessive for a typical meal might be consid-\nered normal during a celebration or holiday meal. A “discrete period of time” refers to a\nlimited period, usually less than 2 hours. A single episode of binge eating need not be re-\nstricted to one setting. For example, an individual may begin a binge in a restaurant and\nthen continue to eat on returning home. Continual snacking on small amounts of food\nthroughout the day would not be considered an eating binge. \nAn occurrence of excessive food consumption must be accompanied by a sense of lack\nof control (Criterion A2) to be considered an episode of binge eating. An indicator of loss\nof control is the inability to refrain from eating or to stop eating once started. Some indi-\nviduals describe a dissociative quality during, or following, the binge-eating episodes. The\nimpairment in control associated with binge eating may not be absolute; for example, an\nindividual may continue binge eating while the telephone is ringing but will cease if a\nroommate or spouse unexpectedly enters the room. Some individuals report that their\nbinge-eating episodes are no longer characterized by an acute feeling of loss of control but\nrather by a more generalized pattern of uncontrolled eating. If individuals report that they\nhave abandoned efforts to control their eating, loss of control should be considered as\npresent. Binge eating can also be planned in some instances.\nThe type of food consumed during binges varies both across individuals and for a\ngiven individual. Binge eating appears to be characterized more by an abnormality in the\namount of food consumed than by a craving for a specific nutrient. However, during binges,\nindividuals tend to eat foods they would otherwise avoid. \nIndividuals with bulimia nervosa are typically ashamed of their eating problems and\nattempt to conceal their symptoms. Binge eating usually occurs in secrecy or as inconspic-\nuously as possible. The binge eating often continues until the individual is uncomfortably,\nor even painfully, full. The most common antecedent of binge eating is negative affect.\nOther triggers include interpersonal stressors; dietary restraint; negative feelings related\nto body weight, body shape, and food; and boredom. Binge eating may minimize or mit-\nigate factors that precipitated the episode in the short-term, but negative self-evaluation\nand dysphoria often are the delayed consequences.\nAnother essential feature of bulimia nervosa is the recurrent use of inappropriate com-\npensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain, collectively referred to as purge behaviors or\npurging (Criterion B). Many individuals with bulimia nervosa employ several methods to\ncompensate for binge eating. Vomiting is the most common inappropriate compensatory\nbehavior. The immediate effects of vomiting include relief from physical discomfort and re-\nduction of fear of gaining weight. In some cases, vomiting becomes a goal in itself, and the\nindividual will binge eat in order to vomit or will vomit after eating a small amount of food.\nIndividuals with bulimia nervosa may use a variety of methods to induce vomiting, includ-\ning the use of fingers or instruments to stimulate the gag reflex. Individuals generally\nbecome adept at inducing vomiting and are eventually able to vomit at will. Rarely, indi-\nviduals consume syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting. Other purging behaviors include the\nmisuse of laxatives and diuretics. A number of other compensatory methods may also be\nused in rare cases. Individuals with bulimia nervosa may misuse enemas following epi-\nsodes of binge eating, but this is seldom the sole compensatory method employed. Individ-\nuals with this disorder may take thyroid hormone in an attempt to avoid weight gain.\nIndividuals with diabetes mellitus and bulimia nervosa may omit or reduce insulin doses in\norder to reduce the metabolism of food consumed during eating binges. Individuals with\nbulimia nervosa may fast for a day or more or exercise excessively in an attempt to prevent\nweight gain. Exercise may be considered excessive when it significantly interferes with im-\nportant activities, when it occurs at inappropriate times or in inappropriate settings, or\nwhen the individual continues to exercise despite injury or other medical complications.\nIndividuals with bulimia nervosa place an excessive emphasis on body shape or weight\nin their self-evaluation, and these factors are typically extremely important in determining\nBulimia Nervosa\n347\nself-esteem (Criterion D). Individuals with this disorder may closely resemble those with\nanorexia nervosa in their fear of gaining weight, in their desire to lose weight, and in the\nlevel of dissatisfaction with their bodies. However, a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa should\nnot be given when the disturbance occurs only during episodes of anorexia nervosa (Cri-\nterion E).\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with bulimia nervosa typically are within the normal weight or overweight\nrange (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 18.5 and < 30 in adults). The disorder occurs but is un-\ncommon among obese individuals. Between eating binges, individuals with bulimia ner-\nvosa typically restrict their total caloric consumption and preferentially select low-calorie\n(“diet”) foods while avoiding foods that they perceive to be fattening or likely to trigger a\nbinge.\nMenstrual irregularity or amenorrhea often occurs among females with bulimia ner-\nvosa; it is uncertain whether such disturbances are related to weight fluctuations, to nu-\ntritional deficiencies, or to emotional distress. The fluid and electrolyte disturbances\nresulting from the purging behavior are sometimes sufficiently severe to constitute med-\nically serious problems. Rare but potentially fatal complications include esophageal tears,\ngastric rupture, and cardiac arrhythmias. Serious cardiac and skeletal myopathies have\nbeen reported among individuals following repeated use of syrup of ipecac to induce vom-\niting. Individuals who chronically abuse laxatives may become dependent on their use to\nstimulate bowel movements. Gastrointestinal symptoms are commonly associated with\nbulimia nervosa, and rectal prolapse has also been reported among individuals with this\ndisorder.\nPrevalence\nTwelve-month prevalence of bulimia nervosa among young females is 1%–1.5%. Point\nprevalence is highest among young adults since the disorder peaks in older adolescence\nand young adulthood. Less is known about the point prevalence of bulimia nervosa in\nmales, but bulimia nervosa is far less common in males than it is in females, with an ap-\nproximately 10:1 female-to-male ratio. \nDevelopment and Course\nBulimia nervosa commonly begins in adolescence or young adulthood. Onset before pu-\nberty or after age 40 is uncommon. The binge eating frequently begins during or after an\nepisode of dieting to lose weight. Experiencing multiple stressful life events also can pre-\ncipitate onset of bulimia nervosa.\nDisturbed eating behavior persists for at least several years in a high percentage of\nclinic samples. The course may be chronic or intermittent, with periods of remission\nalternating with recurrences of binge eating. However, over longer-term follow-up, the\nsymptoms of many individuals appear to diminish with or without treatment, although\ntreatment clearly impacts outcome. Periods of remission longer than 1 year are associated\nwith better long-term outcome.\nSignificantly elevated risk for mortality (all-cause and suicide) has been reported for\nindividuals with bulimia nervosa. The CMR (crude mortality rate) for bulimia nervosa is\nnearly 2% per decade. \nDiagnostic cross-over from initial bulimia nervosa to anorexia nervosa occurs in a mi-\nnority of cases (10%–15%). Individuals who do experience cross-over to anorexia nervosa\ncommonly will revert back to bulimia nervosa or have multiple occurrences of cross-overs\nbetween these disorders. A subset of individuals with bulimia nervosa continue to binge\neat but no longer engage in inappropriate compensatory behaviors, and therefore their\n348\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\nsymptoms meet criteria for binge-eating disorder or other specified eating disorder. Diag-\nnosis should be based on the current (i.e., past 3 months) clinical presentation.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nTemperamental.\nWeight concerns, low self-esteem, depressive symptoms, social anxi-\nety disorder, and overanxious disorder of childhood are associated with increased risk for\nthe development of bulimia nervosa. \nEnvironmental.\nInternalization of a thin body ideal has been found to increase risk for\ndeveloping weight concerns, which in turn increase risk for the development of bulimia\nnervosa. Individuals who experienced childhood sexual or physical abuse are at increased\nrisk for developing bulimia nervosa. \nGenetic and physiological.\nChildhood obesity and early pubertal maturation increase\nrisk for bulimia nervosa. Familial transmission of bulimia nervosa may be present, as well\nas genetic vulnerabilities for the disorder.\nCourse modifiers.\nSeverity of psychiatric comorbidity predicts worse long-term outcome\nof bulimia nervosa.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nBulimia nervosa has been reported to occur with roughly similar frequencies in most in-\ndustrialized countries, including the United States, Canada, many European countries,\nAustralia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Africa. In clinical studies of bulimia nervosa in\nthe United States, individuals presenting with this disorder are primarily white. However,\nthe disorder also occurs in other ethnic groups and with prevalence comparable to esti-\nmated prevalences observed in white samples.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nBulimia nervosa is far more common in females than in males. Males are especially under-\nrepresented in treatment-seeking samples, for reasons that have not yet been systemati-\ncally examined.\nDiagnostic Markers\nNo specific diagnostic test for bulimia nervosa currently exists. However, several labora-\ntory abnormalities may occur as a consequence of purging and may increase diagnostic\ncertainty. These include fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypokalemia (which\ncan provoke cardiac arrhythmias), hypochloremia, and hyponatremia. The loss of gastric\nacid through vomiting may produce a metabolic alkalosis (elevated serum bicarbonate),\nand the frequent induction of diarrhea or dehydration through laxative and diuretic abuse\ncan cause metabolic acidosis. Some individuals with bulimia nervosa exhibit mildly ele-\nvated levels of serum amylase, probably reflecting an increase in the salivary isoenzyme.\nPhysical examination usually yields no physical findings. However, inspection of the\nmouth may reveal significant and permanent loss of dental enamel, especially from lin-\ngual surfaces of the front teeth due to recurrent vomiting. These teeth may become\nchipped and appear ragged and “moth-eaten.” There may also be an increased frequency\nof dental caries. In some individuals, the salivary glands, particularly the parotid glands,\nmay become notably enlarged. Individuals who induce vomiting by manually stimulating\nthe gag reflex may develop calluses or scars on the dorsal surface of the hand from re-\npeated contact with the teeth. Serious cardiac and skeletal myopathies have been reported\namong individuals following repeated use of syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting.\nBulimia Nervosa\n349\nSuicide Risk\nSuicide risk is elevated in bulimia nervosa. Comprehensive evaluation of individuals with\nthis disorder should include assessment of suicide-related ideation and behaviors as well\nas other risk factors for suicide, including a history of suicide attempts.\nFunctional Consequences of Bulimia Nervosa\nIndividuals with bulimia nervosa may exhibit a range of functional limitations associated\nwith the disorder. A minority of individuals report severe role impairment, with the so-\ncial-life domain most likely to be adversely affected by bulimia nervosa. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nAnorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type.\nIndividuals whose binge-eating behav-\nior occurs only during episodes of anorexia nervosa are given the diagnosis anorexia ner-\nvosa, binge-eating/purging type, and should not be given the additional diagnosis of\nbulimia nervosa. For individuals with an initial diagnosis of anorexia nervosa who binge\nand purge but whose presentation no longer meets the full criteria for anorexia nervosa,\nbinge-eating/purging type (e.g., when weight is normal), a diagnosis of bulimia ner-\nvosa should be given only when all criteria for bulimia nervosa have been met for at least\n3 months. \nBinge-eating disorder.\nSome individuals binge eat but do not engage in regular inap-\npropriate compensatory behaviors. In these cases, the diagnosis of binge-eating disorder\nshould be considered.\nKleine-Levin syndrome.\nIn certain neurological or other medical conditions, such as\nKleine-Levin syndrome, there is disturbed eating behavior, but the characteristic psycho-\nlogical features of bulimia nervosa, such as overconcern with body shape and weight, are\nnot present. \nMajor depressive disorder, with atypical features.\nOvereating is common in major de-\npressive disorder, with atypical features, but individuals with this disorder do not engage\nin inappropriate compensatory behaviors and do not exhibit the excessive concern with\nbody shape and weight characteristic of bulimia nervosa. If criteria for both disorders are\nmet, both diagnoses should be given. \nBorderline personality disorder.\nBinge-eating behavior is included in the impulsive be-\nhavior criterion that is part of the definition of borderline personality disorder. If the cri-\nteria for both borderline personality disorder and bulimia nervosa are met, both diagnoses\nshould be given.\nComorbidity \nComorbidity with mental disorders is common in individuals with bulimia nervosa, with\nmost experiencing at least one other mental disorder and many experiencing multiple co-\nmorbidities. Comorbidity is not limited to any particular subset but rather occurs across a\nwide range of mental disorders. There is an increased frequency of depressive symptoms\n(e.g., low self-esteem) and bipolar and depressive disorders (particularly depressive dis-\norders) in individuals with bulimia nervosa. In many individuals, the mood disturbance\nbegins at the same time as or following the development of bulimia nervosa, and individ-\nuals often ascribe their mood disturbances to the bulimia nervosa. However, in some in-\ndividuals, the mood disturbance clearly precedes the development of bulimia nervosa.\nThere may also be an increased frequency of anxiety symptoms (e.g., fear of social situa-\ntions) or anxiety disorders. These mood and anxiety disturbances frequently remit follow-\n350\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\ning effective treatment of the bulimia nervosa. The lifetime prevalence of substance use,\nparticularly alcohol or stimulant use, is at least 30% among individuals with bulimia ner-\nvosa. Stimulant use often begins in an attempt to control appetite and weight. A substan-\ntial percentage of individuals with bulimia nervosa also have personality features that\nmeet criteria for one or more personality disorders, most frequently borderline personality\ndisorder.", "provenance": {"source_file": "feeding_eating_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 5, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.463382"}}

Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized\nby both of the following:\n1. Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), an amount of\nfood that is definitely larger than what most people would eat in a similar period of\ntime under similar circumstances.\n2. A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that one\ncannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).\nB. The binge-eating episodes are associated with three (or more) of the following:\n1. Eating much more rapidly than normal.\n2. Eating until feeling uncomfortably full.\n3. Eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry.\n4. Eating alone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is eating.\n5. Feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or very guilty afterward.\nC. Marked distress regarding binge eating is present.\nD. The binge eating occurs, on average, at least once a week for 3 months.\nE. The binge eating is not associated with the recurrent use of inappropriate compensa-\ntory behavior as in bulimia nervosa and does not occur exclusively during the course\nof bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa.\nSpecify if:\nIn partial remission: After full criteria for binge-eating disorder were previously met,\nbinge eating occurs at an average frequency of less than one episode per week for a\nsustained period of time. \nIn full remission: After full criteria for binge-eating disorder were previously met, none\nof the criteria have been met for a sustained period of time.\nSpecify current severity:\nThe minimum level of severity is based on the frequency of episodes of binge eating (see\nbelow). The level of severity may be increased to reflect other symptoms and the degree\nof functional disability.\nMild: 1–3 binge-eating episodes per week.\nModerate: 4–7 binge-eating episodes per week.\nSevere: 8–13 binge-eating episodes per week.\nExtreme: 14 or more binge-eating episodes per week.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of binge-eating disorder is recurrent episodes of binge eating that\nmust occur, on average, at least once per week for 3 months (Criterion D). An “episode of\nbinge eating” is defined as eating, in a discrete period of time, an amount of food that is defi-\nBinge-Eating Disorder\n351\nnitely larger than most people would eat in a similar period of time under similar circum-\nstances (Criterion A1). The context in which the eating occurs may affect the clinician’s\nestimation of whether the intake is excessive. For example, a quantity of food that might be\nregarded as excessive for a typical meal might be considered normal during a celebration\nor holiday meal. A “discrete period of time” refers to a limited period, usually less than\n2 hours. A single episode of binge eating need not be restricted to one setting. For example,\nan individual may begin a binge in a restaurant and then continue to eat on returning\nhome. Continual snacking on small amounts of food throughout the day would not be con-\nsidered an eating binge. \nAn occurrence of excessive food consumption must be accompanied by a sense of lack\nof control (Criterion A2) to be considered an episode of binge eating. An indicator of loss\nof control is the inability to refrain from eating or to stop eating once started. Some indi-\nviduals describe a dissociative quality during, or following, the binge-eating episodes. The\nimpairment in control associated with binge eating may not be absolute; for example, an\nindividual may continue binge eating while the telephone is ringing but will cease if a\nroommate or spouse unexpectedly enters the room. Some individuals report that their\nbinge-eating episodes are no longer characterized by an acute feeling of loss of control but\nrather by a more generalized pattern of uncontrolled eating. If individuals report that they\nhave abandoned efforts to control their eating, loss of control may still be considered as\npresent. Binge eating can also be planned in some instances.\nThe type of food consumed during binges varies both across individuals and for a given\nindividual. Binge eating appears to be characterized more by an abnormality in the amount\nof food consumed than by a craving for a specific nutrient.\nBinge eating must be characterized by marked distress (Criterion C) and at least three\nof the following features: eating much more rapidly than normal; eating until feeling un-\ncomfortably full; eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry; eating\nalone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is eating; and feeling disgusted\nwith oneself, depressed, or very guilty afterward (Criterion B).\nIndividuals with binge-eating disorder are typically ashamed of their eating problems\nand attempt to conceal their symptoms. Binge eating usually occurs in secrecy or as incon-\nspicuously as possible. The most common antecedent of binge eating is negative affect.\nOther triggers include interpersonal stressors; dietary restraint; negative feelings related\nto body weight, body shape, and food; and boredom. Binge eating may minimize or mit-\nigate factors that precipitated the episode in the short-term, but negative self-evaluation\nand dysphoria often are the delayed consequences.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nBinge-eating disorder occurs in normal-weight/overweight and obese individuals. It is re-\nliably associated with overweight and obesity in treatment-seeking individuals. Never-\ntheless, binge-eating disorder is distinct from obesity. Most obese individuals do not\nengage in recurrent binge eating. In addition, compared with weight-matched obese indi-\nviduals without binge-eating disorder, those with the disorder consume more calories in\nlaboratory studies of eating behavior and have greater functional impairment, lower qual-\nity of life, more subjective distress, and greater psychiatric comorbidity.\nPrevalence\nTwelve-month prevalence of binge-eating disorder among U.S. adult (age 18 or older) fe-\nmales and males is 1.6% and 0.8%, respectively. The gender ratio is far less skewed in binge-\neating disorder than in bulimia nervosa. Binge-eating disorder is as prevalent among fe-\nmales from racial or ethnic minority groups as has been reported for white females. The\ndisorder is more prevalent among individuals seeking weight-loss treatment than in the\ngeneral population. \n352\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\nDevelopment and Course\nLittle is known about the development of binge-eating disorder. Both binge eating and\nloss-of-control eating without objectively excessive consumption occur in children and are\nassociated with increased body fat, weight gain, and increases in psychological symptoms.\nBinge eating is common in adolescent and college-age samples. Loss-of-control eating or\nepisodic binge eating may represent a prodromal phase of eating disorders for some indi-\nviduals. \nDieting follows the development of binge eating in many individuals with binge-\neating disorder. (This is in contrast to bulimia nervosa, in which dysfunctional dieting\nusually precedes the onset of binge eating.) Binge-eating disorder typically begins in ad-\nolescence or young adulthood but can begin in later adulthood. Individuals with binge-\neating disorder who seek treatment usually are older than individuals with either bulimia\nnervosa or anorexia nervosa who seek treatment.\nRemission rates in both natural course and treatment outcome studies are higher for\nbinge-eating disorder than for bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa. Binge-eating disorder\nappears to be relatively persistent, and the course is comparable to that of bulimia nervosa\nin terms of severity and duration. Crossover from binge-eating disorder to other eating\ndisorders is uncommon.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nGenetic and physiological.\nBinge-eating disorder appears to run in families, which may\nreflect additive genetic influences. \nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nBinge-eating disorder occurs with roughly similar frequencies in most industrialized\ncountries, including the United States, Canada, many European countries, Australia, and\nNew Zealand. In the United States, the prevalence of binge-eating disorder appears com-\nparable among non-Latino whites, Latinos, Asians, and African Americans.\nFunctional Consequences of Binge-Eating Disorder\nBinge-eating disorder is associated with a range of functional consequences, including so-\ncial role adjustment problems, impaired health-related quality of life and life satisfaction,\nincreased medical morbidity and mortality, and associated increased health care utiliza-\ntion compared with body mass index (BMI)–matched control subjects. It may also be as-\nsociated with an increased risk for weight gain and the development of obesity.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nBulimia nervosa.\nBinge-eating disorder has recurrent binge eating in common with bu-\nlimia nervosa but differs from the latter disorder in some fundamental respects. In terms of\nclinical presentation, the recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior (e.g., purging,\ndriven exercise) seen in bulimia nervosa is absent in binge-eating disorder. Unlike in-\ndividuals with bulimia nervosa, individuals with binge-eating disorder typically do not\nshow marked or sustained dietary restriction designed to influence body weight and\nshape between binge-eating episodes. They may, however, report frequent attempts at\ndieting. Binge-eating disorder also differs from bulimia nervosa in terms of response to treat-\nment. Rates of improvement are consistently higher among individuals with binge-eating\ndisorder than among those with bulimia nervosa.\nObesity.\nBinge-eating disorder is associated with overweight and obesity but has\nseveral key features that are distinct from obesity. First, levels of overvaluation of body\nOther Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder\n353\nweight and shape are higher in obese individuals with the disorder than in those without\nthe disorder. Second, rates of psychiatric comorbidity are significantly higher among\nobese individuals with the disorder compared with those without the disorder. Third, the\nlong-term successful outcome of evidence-based psychological treatments for binge-\neating disorder can be contrasted with the absence of effective long-term treatments for\nobesity.\nBipolar and depressive disorders.\nIncreases in appetite and weight gain are included\nin the criteria for major depressive episode and in the atypical features specifiers for de-\npressive and bipolar disorders. Increased eating in the context of a major depressive epi-\nsode may or may not be associated with loss of control. If the full criteria for both disorders\nare met, both diagnoses can be given. Binge eating and other symptoms of disordered eat-\ning are seen in association with bipolar disorder. If the full criteria for both disorders are\nmet, both diagnoses should be given.\nBorderline personality disorder.\nBinge eating is included in the impulsive behavior cri-\nterion that is part of the definition of borderline personality disorder. If the full criteria for\nboth disorders are met, both diagnoses should be given.\nComorbidity \nBinge-eating disorder is associated with significant psychiatric comorbidity that is com-\nparable to that of bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa. The most common comorbid dis-\norders are bipolar disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and, to a lesser\ndegree, substance use disorders. The psychiatric comorbidity is linked to the severity of\nbinge eating and not to the degree of obesity.", "provenance": {"source_file": "feeding_eating_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 6, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.463382"}}
