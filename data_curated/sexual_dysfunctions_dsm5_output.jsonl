The man reports difficulty or inability to ejaculate de-\nspite the presence of adequate sexual stimulation and the desire to ejaculate. The present-\ning complaint usually involves partnered sexual activity. In most cases, the diagnosis will\nbe made by self-report of the individual. The definition of “delay” does not have precise\nboundaries, as there is noconsensus as to what constitutes a reasonable time to reach or-\ngasm or what is unacceptably long for most men and their sexual partners.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nThe man and his partner may report prolonged thrusting to achieve orgasm to the point of\nexhaustion or genital discomfort and then ceasing efforts. Some men may report avoiding\nDelayed Ejaculation\n425\nsexual activity because of a repetitive pattern of difficulty ejaculating. Some sexual partners\nmay report feeling less sexually attractive because their partner cannot ejaculate easily.\nIn addition to the subtypes “lifelong/acquired” and “generalized/situational,” the fol-\nlowing five factors must be considered during assessment and diagnosis of delayed ejacu-\nlation, given that they may be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner factors (e.g.,\npartner’s sexual problems, partner’s health status); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor com-\nmunication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors\n(e.g., poor body image; history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g.,\ndepression, anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4) cultural/religious factors\n(e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality);\nand 5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Each of these factors may\ncontribute differently to the presenting symptoms of different men with this disorder.\nPrevalence\nPrevalence is unclear because of the lack of a precise definition of this syndrome. It is the\nleast common male sexual complaint. Only 75% of men report always ejaculating during\nsexual activity, and less than 1% of men will complain of problems with reaching ejacula-\ntion that last more than 6 months.\nDevelopment and Course\nLifelong delayed ejaculation begins with early sexual experiences and continues through-\nout life. By definition, acquired delayed ejaculation begins after a period of normal sexual\nfunction. There is minimal evidence concerning the course of acquired delayed ejacula-\ntion. The prevalence of delayed ejaculation appears to remain relatively constant until\naround age 50 years, when the incidence begins to increase significantly. Men in their 80s\nreport twice as much difficulty ejaculating as men younger than 59 years.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nGenetic and physiological.\nAge-related loss of the fast-conducting peripheral sensory\nnerves and age-related decreased sex steroid secretion may be associated with the increase\nin delayed ejaculation in men older than 50 years.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nComplaints of ejaculatory delay vary across countries and cultures. Such complaints are\nmore common among men in Asian populations than in men living in Europe, Australia,\nor the United States. This variation may be attributable to cultural or genetic differences\nbetween cultures.\nFunctional Consequences of Delayed Ejaculation\nDifficulty with ejaculation may contribute to difficulties in conception. Delayed ejacula-\ntion is often associated with considerable psychological distress in one or both partners.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nAnother medical condition.\nThe major differential diagnosis is between delayed ejacu-\nlation fully explained by another medical illness or injury and delayed ejaculation with a\npsychogenic, idiopathic, or combined psychological and medical etiology. A situational\naspect to the complaint is suggestive of a psychological basis for the problem (e.g., men\nwho can ejaculate during sexual activity with one sex but not the other; men who can ejac-\nulate with one partner but not another of the same sex; men with paraphilic arousal pat-\n426\nSexual Dysfunctions\nterns; men who require highly ritualized activity to ejaculate during partnered sexual\nactivity). Another medical illness or injury may produce delays in ejaculation independent\nof psychological issues. For example, inability to ejaculate can be caused by interruption of\nthe nerve supply to the genitals, such as can occur after traumatic surgical injury to the\nlumbar sympathetic ganglia, abdominoperitoneal surgery, or lumbar sympathectomy.\nEjaculation is thought to be under autonomic nervous system control involving the hypo-\ngastric (sympathetic) and pudendal (parasympathetic) nerves. A number of neurodegen-\nerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and diabetic and alcoholic neuropathy, can\ncause inability to ejaculate. Delayed ejaculation should also be differentiated from retro-\ngrade ejaculation (i.e., ejaculation into the bladder), which may follow transurethral pros-\ntatic resection.\nSubstance/medication use.\nA number of pharmacological agents, such as antidepres-\nsants, antipsychotics, alpha sympathetic drugs, and opioid drugs, can cause ejaculatory\nproblems.\nDysfunction with orgasm.\nIt is important in the history to ascertain whether the com-\nplaint concerns delayed ejaculation or the sensation of orgasm, or both. Ejaculation occurs\nin the genitals, whereas the experience of orgasm is believed to be primarily subjective.\nEjaculation and orgasm usually occur together but not always. For example, a man with a\nnormal ejaculatory pattern may complain of decreased pleasure (i.e., anhedonic ejacula-\ntion). Such a complaint would not be coded as delayed ejaculation but could be coded as\nother specified sexual dysfunction or unspecified sexual dysfunction. \nComorbidity \nThere is some evidence to suggest that delayed ejaculation may be more common in severe\nforms of major depressive disorder.", "provenance": {"source_file": "sexual_dysfunctions_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 1, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.533338"}}

A careful sexual history is necessary\nto ascertain that the problem has been present for a significant duration of time (i.e., at least\napproximately 6 months) and occurs on the majority of sexual occasions (i.e., at least 75%\nof the time). Symptoms may occur only in specific situations involving certain types of\nstimulation or partners, or they may occur in a generalized manner in all types of situa-\ntions, stimulation, or partners. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nMany men with erectile disorder may have low self-esteem, low self-confidence, and a de-\ncreased sense of masculinity, and may experience depressed affect. Fear and/or avoid-\nance of future sexual encounters may occur. Decreased sexual satisfaction and reduced\nsexual desire in the individual’s partner are common. \nIn addition to the subtypes “lifelong/acquired” and “generalized/situational,” the fol-\nlowing five factors must be considered during assessment and diagnosis of erectile disorder\ngiven that they may be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner factors (e.g., part-\nner’s sexual problems, partner’s health status); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor communi-\ncation, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors (e.g.,\npoor body image, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., de-\npression, anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4) cultural/religious factors (e.g.,\ninhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and\n5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Each of these factors may con-\ntribute differently to the presenting symptoms of different men with this disorder. \nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of lifelong versus acquired erectile disorder is unknown. There is a strong\nage-related increase in both prevalence and incidence of problems with erection, particu-\nlarly after age 50 years. Approximately 13%–21% of men ages 40–80 years complain of oc-\ncasional problems with erections. Approximately 2% of men younger than age 40–50 years\ncomplain of frequent problems with erections, whereas 40%–50% of men older than 60–70\nyears may have significant problems with erections. About 20% of men fear erectile prob-\nlems on their first sexual experience, whereas approximately 8% experienced erectile prob-\nlems that hindered penetration during their first sexual experience.\nDevelopment and Course \nErectile failure on first sexual attempt has been found to be related to having sex with a pre-\nviously unknown partner, concomitant use of drugs or alcohol, not wanting to have sex, and\npeer pressure. There is minimal evidence regarding the persistence of such problems after\nthe first attempt. It is assumed that most of these problems spontaneously remit without pro-\nfessional intervention, but some men may continue to have episodic problems. In contrast,\nacquired erectile disorder is often associated with biological factors such as diabetes and car-\ndiovascular disease. Acquired erectile disorder is likely to be persistent in most men.\nThe natural history of lifelong erectile disorder is unknown. Clinical observation sup-\nports the association of lifelong erectile disorder with psychological factors that are self-\n428\nSexual Dysfunctions\nlimiting or responsive to psychological interventions, whereas, as noted above, acquired\nerectile disorder is more likely to be related to biological factors and to be persistent. The\nincidence of erectile disorder increases with age. A minority of men diagnosed as having\nmoderate erectile failure may experience spontaneous remission of symptoms without\nmedical intervention. Distress associated with erectile disorder is lower in older men as\ncompared with younger men.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nTemperamental.\nNeurotic personality traits may be associated with erectile problems in col-\nlege students, and submissive personality traits may be associated with erectile problems in\nmen age 40 years and older. Alexithymia (i.e., deficits in cognitive processing of emotions) is\ncommon in men diagnosed with “psychogenic” erectile dysfunction. Erectile problems are\ncommon in men diagnosed with depression and posttraumatic stress disorder.\nCourse modifiers.\nRisk factors for acquired erectile disorder include age, smoking to-\nbacco, lack of physical exercise, diabetes, and decreased desire.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nComplaints of erectile disorder have been found to vary across countries. It is unclear to\nwhat extent these differences represent differences in cultural expectations as opposed to\ngenuine differences in the frequency of erectile failure.\nDiagnostic Markers\nNocturnal penile tumescence testing and measured erectile turgidity during sleep can be\nemployed to help differentiate organic from psychogenic erectile problems on the as-\nsumption that adequate erections during rapid eye movement sleep indicate a psycholog-\nical etiology to the problem. A number of other diagnostic procedures may be employed\ndepending on the clinician’s assessment of their relevance given the individual’s age, co-\nmorbid medical problems, and clinical presentation. Doppler ultrasonography and intra-\nvascular injection of vasoactive drugs, as well as invasive diagnostic procedures such as\ndynamic infusion cavernosography, can be used to assess vascular integrity. Pudendal\nnerve conduction studies, including somatosensory evoked potentials, can be employed\nwhen a peripheral neuropathy is suspected. In men also complaining of decreased sexual\ndesire, serum bioavailable or free testosterone is frequently assessed to determine if the\ndifficulty is secondary to endocrinological factors. Thyroid function may also be assessed.\nDetermination of fasting serum glucose is useful to screen for the presence of diabetes mel-\nlitus. The assessment of serum lipids is important, as erectile disorder in men 40 years and\nolder is predictive of the future risk of coronary artery disease.\nFunctional Consequences of Erectile Disorder\nErectile disorder can interfere with fertility and produce both individual and interpersonal\ndistress. Fear and/or avoidance of sexual encounters may interfere with the ability to de-\nvelop intimate relationships.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nNonsexual mental disorders.\nMajor depressive disorder and erectile disorder are closely\nassociated, and erectile disorder accompanying severe depressive disorder may occur.\nNormal erectile function.\nThe differential should include consideration of normal erec-\ntile function in men with excessive expectations.\nFemale Orgasmic Disorder\n429\nSubstance/medication use.\nAnother major differential diagnosis is whether the erectile\nproblem is secondary to substance/medication use. An onset that coincides with the be-\nginning of substance/medication use and that dissipates with discontinuation of the sub-\nstance/medication or dose reduction is suggestive of a substance/medication-induced\nsexual dysfunction.\nAnother medical condition.\nThe most difficult aspect of the differential diagnosis of erec-\ntile disorder is ruling out erectile problems that are fully explained by medical factors. Such\ncases would not receive a diagnosis of a mental disorder. The distinction between erectile\ndisorder as a mental disorder and erectile dysfunction as the result of another medical con-\ndition is usually unclear, and many cases will have complex, interactive biological and psy-\nchiatric etiologies. If the individual is older than 40–50 years and/or has concomitant\nmedical problems, the differential diagnosis should include medical etiologies, especially\nvascular disease. The presence of an organic disease known to cause erectile problems does\nnot confirm a causal relationship. For example, a man with diabetes mellitus can develop\nerectile disorder in response to psychological stress. In general, erectile dysfunction due to\norganic factors is generalized and gradual in onset. An exception would be erectile problems\nafter traumatic injury to the nervous innervation of the genital organs (e.g., spinal cord injury).\nErectile problems that are situational and inconsistent and that have an acute onset after a\nstressful life event are most often due to psychological events. An age of less than 40 years is\nalso suggestive of a psychological etiology to the difficulty.\nOther sexual dysfunctions.\nErectile disorder may coexist with premature (early) ejacu-\nlation and male hypoactive sexual desire disorder.\nComorbidity \nErectile disorder can be comorbid with other sexual diagnoses, such as premature (early)\nejaculation and male hypoactive sexual desire disorder, as well as with anxiety and de-\npressive disorders. Erectile disorder is common in men with lower urinary tract symptoms\nrelated to prostatic hypertrophy. Erectile disorder may be comorbid with dyslipidemia, car-\ndiovascular disease, hypogonadism, multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and other diseases\nthat interfere with the vascular, neurological, or endocrine function necessary for normal\nerectile function.\nRelationship to International Classification of Diseases\nErectile response is coded as failure of genital response in ICD-10 (F2.2).", "provenance": {"source_file": "sexual_dysfunctions_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 2, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.533338"}}

Women show wide vari-\nability in the type or intensity of stimulation that elicits orgasm. Similarly, subjective descrip-\ntions of orgasm are extremely varied, suggesting that it is experienced in very different\nways, both across women and on different occasions by the same woman. For a diagnosis\nof female orgasmic disorder, symptoms must be experienced on almost all or all (approx-\nimately 75%–100%) occasions of sexual activity (in identified situational contexts or, if\ngeneralized, in all contexts) and have a minimum duration of approximately 6 months.\nThe use of the minimum severity and duration criteria is intended to distinguish transient\norgasm difficulties from more persistent orgasmic dysfunction. The inclusion of “approx-\nimately” in Criterion B allows for clinician judgment in cases in which symptom duration\ndoes not meet the recommended 6-month threshold.\nFor a woman to have a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder, clinically significant dis-\ntress must accompany the symptoms (Criterion C). In many cases of orgasm problems, the\ncauses are multifactorial or cannot be determined. If female orgasmic disorder is deemed\nto be better explained by another mental disorder, the effects of a substance/medication,\nor a medical condition, then a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would not be made.\nFinally, if interpersonal or significant contextual factors, such as severe relationship dis-\ntress, intimate partner violence, or other significant stressors, are present, then a diagnosis\nof female orgasmic disorder would not be made.\nMany women require clitoral stimulation to reach orgasm, and a relatively small pro-\nportion of women report that they always experience orgasm during penile-vaginal inter-\ncourse. Thus, a woman’s experiencing orgasm through clitoral stimulation but not during\nintercourse does not meet criteria for a clinical diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder. It is\nalso important to consider whether orgasmic difficulties are the result of inadequate sex-\nual stimulation; in these cases, there may still be a need for care, but a diagnosis of female\norgasmic disorder would not be made.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis \nAssociations between specific patterns of personality traits or psychopathology and orgas-\nmic dysfunction have generally not been supported. Compared with women without the\ndisorder, some women with female orgasmic disorder may have greater difficulty com-\nmunicating about sexual issues. Overall sexual satisfaction, however, is not strongly cor-\nrelated with orgasmic experience. Many women report high levels of sexual satisfaction\nFemale Orgasmic Disorder\n431\ndespite rarely or never experiencing orgasm. Orgasmic difficulties in women often co-\noccur with problems related to sexual interest and arousal.\nIn addition to the subtypes “lifelong/acquired” and “generalized/situational,” the fol-\nlowing five factors must be considered during assessment and diagnosis of female orgas-\nmic disorder given that they may be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner\nfactors (e.g., partner’s sexual problems, partner’s health status); 2) relationship factors\n(e.g., poor communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual vul-\nnerability factors (e.g., poor body image, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric\ncomorbidity (e.g., depression, anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); (4) cul-\ntural/religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity;\nattitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treat-\nment. Each of these factors may contribute differently to the presenting symptoms of dif-\nferent women with this disorder. \nPrevalence \nReported prevalence rates for female orgasmic problems in women vary widely, from 10%\nto 42%, depending on multiple factors (e.g., age, culture, duration, and severity of symp-\ntoms); however, these estimates do not take into account the presence of distress. Only a\nproportion of women experiencing orgasm difficulties also report associated distress.\nVariation in how symptoms are assessed (e.g., the duration of symptoms and the recall pe-\nriod) also influence prevalence rates. Approximately 10% of women do not experience or-\ngasm throughout their lifetime. \nDevelopment and Course \nBy definition, lifelong female orgasmic disorder indicates that the orgasmic difficulties have\nalways been present, whereas the acquired subtype would be assigned if the woman’s or-\ngasmic difficulties developed after a period of normal orgasmic functioning. \nA woman’s first experience of orgasm can occur any time from the prepubertal period\nto well into adulthood. Women show a more variable pattern in age at first orgasm than do\nmen, and women’s reports of having experienced orgasm increase with age. Many women\nlearn to experience orgasm as they experience a wide variety of stimulation and acquire\nmore knowledge about their bodies. Women’s rates of orgasm consistency (defined as\n“usually or always” experiencing orgasm) are higher during masturbation than during\nsexual activity with a partner. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nTemperamental.\nA wide range of psychological factors, such as anxiety and concerns\nabout pregnancy, can potentially interfere with a woman’s ability to experience orgasm.\nEnvironmental.\nThere is a strong association between relationship problems, physical\nhealth, and mental health and orgasm difficulties in women. Sociocultural factors (e.g.,\ngender role expectations and religious norms) are also important influences on the expe-\nrience of orgasmic difficulties.\nGenetic and physiological.\nMany physiological factors may influence a woman’s expe-\nrience of orgasm, including medical conditions and medications. Conditions such as mul-\ntiple sclerosis, pelvic nerve damage from radical hysterectomy, and spinal cord injury can\nall influence orgasmic functioning in women. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are\nknown to delay or inhibit orgasm in women. Women with vulvovaginal atrophy (charac-\nterized by symptoms such as vaginal dryness, itching, and pain) are significantly more\nlikely to report orgasm difficulties than are women without this condition. Menopausal\nstatus is not consistently associated with the likelihood of orgasm difficulties. There may\nbe a significant genetic contribution to variation in female orgasmic function. However,\n432\nSexual Dysfunctions\npsychological, sociocultural, and physiological factors likely interact in complex ways to\ninfluence women’s experience of orgasm and of orgasm difficulties. \nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues \nThe degree to which lack of orgasm in women is regarded as a problem that requires treat-\nment may vary depending on cultural context. In addition, women differ in how important\norgasm is to their sexual satisfaction. There may be marked sociocultural and generational\ndifferences in women’s orgasmic ability. For example, the prevalence of inability to reach or-\ngasm has ranged from 17.7% (in Northern Europe) to 42.2% (in Southeast Asia). \nDiagnostic Markers \nAlthough measurable physiological changes occur during female orgasm, including\nchanges in hormones, pelvic floor musculature, and brain activation, there is significant\nvariability in these indicators of orgasm across women. In clinical situations, the diagnosis\nof female orgasmic disorder is based on a woman’s self-report.\nFunctional Consequences of Female Orgasmic Disorder \nThe functional consequences of female orgasmic disorder are unclear. Although there is a\nstrong association between relationship problems and orgasmic difficulties in women, it is\nunclear whether relationship factors are risk factors for orgasmic difficulties or are conse-\nquences of those difficulties.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nNonsexual mental disorders.\nNonsexual mental disorders, such as major depressive\ndisorder, which is characterized by markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or al-\nmost all, activities, may explain female orgasmic disorder. If the orgasmic difficulties are\nbetter explained by another mental disorder, then a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder\nwould not be made. \nSubstance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction.\nSubstance/medication use may\nexplain the orgasmic difficulties.\nAnother medical condition.\nIf the disorder is due to another medical condition (e.g.,\nmultiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury), then a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would\nnot be made. \nInterpersonal factors.\nIf interpersonal or significant contextual factors, such as severe\nrelationship distress, intimate partner violence, or other significant stressors, are associ-\nated with the orgasmic difficulties, then a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would\nnot be made.\nOther sexual dysfunctions.\nFemale orgasmic disorder may occur in association with other\nsexual dysfunctions (e.g., female sexual interest/arousal disorder). The presence of another\nsexual dysfunction does not rule out a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder. Occasional or-\ngasmic difficulties that are short-term or infrequent and are not accompanied by clinically sig-\nnificant distress or impairment are not diagnosed as female orgasmic disorder. A diagnosis is\nalso not appropriate if the problems are the result of inadequate sexual stimulation. \nComorbidity\nWomen with female orgasmic disorder may have co-occurring sexual interest/arousal\ndifficulties. Women with diagnoses of other nonsexual mental disorders, such as major de-\npressive disorder, may experience lower sexual interest/arousal, and this may indirectly\nincrease the likelihood of orgasmic difficulties.\nFemale Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder\n433", "provenance": {"source_file": "sexual_dysfunctions_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 3, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.534324"}}

A “desire discrepancy,” in which a woman has lower desire for sexual activ-\nity than her partner, is not sufficient to diagnose female sexual interest/arousal disorder.\nIn order for the criteria for the disorder to be met, there must be absence or reduced fre-\nquency or intensity of at least three of six indicators (Criterion A) for a minimum duration\nof approximately 6 months (Criterion B). There may be different symptom profiles across\nwomen, as well as variability in how sexual interest and arousal are expressed. For exam-\nple, in one woman, sexual interest/arousal disorder may be expressed as a lack of interest\nin sexual activity, an absence of erotic or sexual thoughts, and reluctance to initiate sexual\nactivity and respond to a partner’s sexual invitations. In another woman, an inability to be-\ncome sexually excited, to respond to sexual stimuli with sexual desire, and a correspond-\n434\nSexual Dysfunctions\ning lack of signs of physical sexual arousal may be the primary features. Because sexual\ndesire and arousal frequently coexist and are elicited in response to adequate sexual cues,\nthe criteria for female sexual interest/arousal disorder take into account that difficulties in\ndesire and arousal often simultaneously characterize the complaints of women with this\ndisorder. Short-term changes in sexual interest or arousal are common and may be adaptive\nresponses to events in a woman’s life and do not represent a sexual dysfunction. Diagnosis\nof female sexual interest/arousal disorder requires a minimum duration of symptoms of\napproximately 6 months as a reflection that the symptoms must be a persistent problem.\nThe estimation of persistence may be determined by clinical judgment when a duration of\n6 months cannot be ascertained precisely.\nThere may be absent or reduced frequency or intensity of interest in sexual activity (Crite-\nrion A1), which was previously termed hypoactive sexual desire disorder. The frequency or inten-\nsity of sexual and erotic thoughts or fantasies may be absent or reduced (Criterion A2). The\nexpression of fantasies varies widely across women and may include memories of past sexual\nexperiences. The normative decline in sexual thoughts with age should be taken into account\nwhen this criterion is being assessed. Absence or reduced frequency of initiating sexual activ-\nity and of receptivity to a partner’s sexual invitations (Criterion A3) is a behaviorally focused\ncriterion. A couple’s beliefs and preferences for sexual initiation patterns are highly relevant to\nthe assessment of this criterion. There may be absent or reduced sexual excitement or pleasure\nduring sexual activity in almost all or all (approximately 75%–100%) sexual encounters (Cri-\nterion A4). Lack of pleasure is a common presenting clinical complaint in women with low de-\nsire. Among women who report low sexual desire, there are fewer sexual or erotic cues that\nelicit sexual interest or arousal (i.e., there is a lack of “responsive desire”). Assessment of the\nadequacy of sexual stimuli will assist in determining if there is a difficulty with responsive sex-\nual desire (Criterion A5). Frequency or intensity of genital or nongenital sensations during sex-\nual activity may be reduced or absent (Criterion A6). This may include reduced vaginal\nlubrication/vasocongestion, but because physiological measures of genital sexual response do\nnot differentiate women who report sexual arousal concerns from those who do not, the self-\nreport of reduced or absent genital or nongenital sensations is sufficient. \nFor a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder to be made, clinically signif-\nicant distress must accompany the symptoms in Criterion A. Distress may be experienced\nas a result of the lack of sexual interest/arousal or as a result of significant interference in\na woman’s life and well-being. If a lifelong lack of sexual desire is better explained by one’s\nself-identification as “asexual,” then a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disor-\nder would not be made.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis \nFemale sexual interest/arousal disorder is frequently associated with problems in experi-\nencing orgasm, pain experienced during sexual activity, infrequent sexual activity, and\ncouple-level discrepancies in desire. Relationship difficulties and mood disorders are also\nfrequently associated features of female sexual interest/arousal disorder. Unrealistic ex-\npectations and norms regarding the “appropriate” level of sexual interest or arousal, along\nwith poor sexual techniques and lack of information about sexuality, may also be evident\nin women diagnosed with female sexual interest/arousal disorder. The latter, as well as\nnormative beliefs about gender roles, are important factors to consider.\nIn addition to the subtypes “lifelong/acquired” and “generalized/situational,” the follow-\ning five factors must be considered during assessment and diagnosis of female sexual interest/\narousal disorder given that they may be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner fac-\ntors (e.g., partner’s sexual problems, partner’s health status); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor\ncommunication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors\n(e.g., poor body image, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., de-\npression, anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4) cultural/religious factors (e.g.,\ninhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and\nFemale Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder\n435\n5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Note that each of these factors\nmay contribute differently to the presenting symptoms of different women with this disorder.\nPrevalence \nThe prevalence of female sexual interest/arousal disorder, as defined in this manual, is\nunknown. The prevalence of low sexual desire and of problems with sexual arousal (with\nand without associated distress), as defined by DSM-IV or ICD-10, may vary markedly in\nrelation to age, cultural setting, duration of symptoms, and presence of distress. Regard-\ning duration of symptoms, there are striking differences in prevalence estimates between\nshort-term and persistent problems related to lack of sexual interest. When distress about\nsexual functioning is required, prevalence estimates are markedly lower. Some older\nwomen report less distress about low sexual desire than younger women, although sexual\ndesire may decrease with age. \nDevelopment and Course \nBy definition, lifelong female sexual interest/arousal disorder suggests that the lack of\nsexual interest or arousal has been present for the woman’s entire sexual life. For Criteria\nA3, A4, and A6, which assess functioning during sexual activity, a subtype of lifelong\nwould mean presence of symptoms since the individual’s first sexual experiences. The ac-\nquired subtype would be assigned if the difficulties with sexual interest or arousal de-\nveloped after a period of nonproblematic sexual functioning. Adaptive and normative\nchanges in sexual functioning may result from partner-related, interpersonal, or personal\nevents and may be transient in nature. However, persistence of symptoms for approxi-\nmately 6 months or more would constitute a sexual dysfunction.\nThere are normative changes in sexual interest and arousal across the life span. Fur-\nthermore, women in relationships of longer duration are more likely to report engaging in\nsex despite no obvious feelings of sexual desire at the outset of a sexual encounter com-\npared with women in shorter-duration relationships. Vaginal dryness in older women is\nrelated to age and menopausal status. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nTemperamental.\nTemperamental factors include negative cognitions and attitudes about\nsexuality and past history of mental disorders. Differences in propensity for sexual excitation\nand sexual inhibition may also predict the likelihood of developing sexual problems.\nEnvironmental.\nEnvironmental factors include relationship difficulties, partner sexual\nfunctioning, and developmental history, such as early relationships with caregivers and\nchildhood stressors. \nGenetic and physiological.\nSome medical conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus, thyroid\ndysfunction) can be risk factors for female sexual interest/arousal disorder. There appears\nto be a strong influence of genetic factors on vulnerability to sexual problems in women.\nPsychophysiological research using vaginal photoplethysmography has not found differ-\nences between women with and without perceived lack of genital arousal.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues \nThere is marked variability in prevalence rates of low desire across cultures. Lower rates of\nsexual desire may be more common among East Asian women compared with Euro-\nCanadian women. Although the lower levels of sexual desire and arousal found in men\nand women from East Asian countries compared with Euro-American groups may reflect\nless interest in sex in those cultures, the possibility remains that such group differences are\nan artifact of the measures used to quantify desire. A judgment about whether low sexual\n436\nSexual Dysfunctions\ndesire reported by a woman from a certain ethnocultural group meets criteria for female\nsexual interest/arousal disorder must take into account the fact that different cultures may\npathologize some behaviors and not others.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nBy definition, the diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder is only given to\nwomen. Distressing difficulties with sexual desire in men would be considered under\nmale hypoactive sexual desire disorder.\nFunctional Consequences of \nFemale Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder \nDifficulties in sexual interest/arousal are often associated with decreased relationship sat-\nisfaction.\nDifferential Diagnosis \nNonsexual mental disorders.\nNonsexual mental disorders, such as major depressive\ndisorder, in which there is “markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all,\nactivities most of the day, nearly every day,” may explain the lack of sexual interest/\narousal. If the lack of interest or arousal is completely attributable to another mental dis-\norder, then a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder would not be made.\nSubstance/medication use.\nSubstance or medication use may explain the lack of inter-\nest/arousal.\nAnother medical condition.\nIf the sexual symptoms are considered to be almost exclu-\nsively associated with the effects of another medical condition (e.g., diabetes mellitus, en-\ndothelial disease, thyroid dysfunction, central nervous system disease), then a diagnosis\nof female sexual interest/arousal disorder would not be made. \nInterpersonal factors.\nIf interpersonal or significant contextual factors, such as severe\nrelationship distress, intimate partner violence, or other significant stressors, explain the\nsexual interest/arousal symptoms, then a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal dis-\norder would not be made.\nOther sexual dysfunctions.\nThe presence of another sexual dysfunction does not rule\nout a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder. It is common for women to ex-\nperience more than one sexual dysfunction. For example, the presence of chronic genital\npain may lead to a lack of desire for the (painful) sexual activity. Lack of interest and\narousal during sexual activity may impair orgasmic ability. For some women, all aspects\nof the sexual response may be unsatisfying and distressing.\nInadequate or absent sexual stimuli.\nWhen differential diagnoses are being considered,\nit is important to assess the adequacy of sexual stimuli within the woman’s sexual experi-\nence. In cases where inadequate or absent sexual stimuli are contributing to the clinical pic-\nture, there may be evidence for clinical care, but a sexual dysfunction diagnosis would not\nbe made. Similarly, transient and adaptive alterations in sexual functioning that are second-\nary to a significant life or personal event must be considered in the differential diagnosis.\nComorbidity\nComorbidity between sexual interest/arousal problems and other sexual difficulties is\nextremely common. Sexual distress and dissatisfaction with sex life are also highly cor-\nrelated in women with low sexual desire. Distressing low desire is associated with depres-\nsion, thyroid problems, anxiety, urinary incontinence, and other medical factors. Arthritis\nand inflammatory or irritable bowel disease are also associated with sexual arousal prob-\nGenito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder\n437\nlems.

Because major diffi-\nculty in any one of these symptom dimensions is often sufficient to cause clinically sig-\nnificant distress, a diagnosis can be made on the basis of marked difficulty in only one\nsymptom dimension. However, all four symptom dimensions should be assessed even if a\ndiagnosis can be made on the basis of only one symptom dimension. \nMarked difficulty having vaginal intercourse/penetration (Criterion A1) can vary from a total in-\nability to experience vaginal penetration in any situation (e.g., intercourse, gynecological ex-\naminations, tampon insertion) to the ability to easily experience penetration in one situation\nand but not in another. Although the most common clinical situation is when a woman is un-\nable to experience intercourse or penetration with a partner, difficulties in undergoing re-\nquired gynecological examinations may also be present. Marked vulvovaginal or pelvic pain\nduring vaginal intercourse or penetration attempts (Criterion A2) refers to pain occurring in differ-\nent locations in the genito-pelvic area. Location of pain as well as intensity should be assessed.\nTypically, pain can be characterized as superficial (vulvovaginal or occurring during penetra-\ntion) or deep (pelvic; i.e., not felt until deeper penetration). The intensity of the pain is often not\nlinearly related to distress or interference with sexual intercourse or other sexual activities.\nSome genito-pelvic pain only occurs when provoked (i.e., by intercourse or mechanical stim-\n438\nSexual Dysfunctions\nulation); other genito-pelvic pain may be spontaneous as well as provoked. Genito-pelvic pain\ncan also be usefully characterized qualitatively (e.g., “burning,” “cutting,” “shooting,” “throb-\nbing”). The pain may persist for a period after intercourse is completed and may also occur\nduring urination. Typically, the pain experienced during sexual intercourse can be reproduced\nduring a gynecological examination.\nMarked fear or anxiety about vulvovaginal or pelvic pain either in anticipation of, or during, or\nas a result of vaginal penetration (Criterion A3) is commonly reported by women who have\nregularly experienced pain during sexual intercourse. This “normal” reaction may lead to\navoidance of sexual/intimate situations. In other cases, this marked fear does not appear\nto be closely related to the experience of pain but nonetheless leads to avoidance of inter-\ncourse and vaginal penetration situations. Some have described this as similar to a phobic\nreaction except that the phobic object may be vaginal penetration or the fear of pain.\nMarked tensing or tightening of the pelvic floor muscles during attempted vaginal penetration\n(Criterion A4) can vary from reflexive-like spasm of the pelvic floor in response to at-\ntempted vaginal entry to “normal/voluntary” muscle guarding in response to the antici-\npated or the repeated experience of pain or to fear or anxiety. In the case of “normal/\nguarding” reactions, penetration may be possible under circumstances of relaxation. The\ncharacterization and assessment of pelvic floor dysfunction is often best undertaken by a\nspecialist gynecologist or by a pelvic floor physical therapist. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis \nGenito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder is frequently associated with other sexual dysfunc-\ntions, particularly reduced sexual desire and interest (female sexual interest/arousal disor-\nder). Sometimes desire and interest are preserved in sexual situations that are not painful or\ndo not require penetration. Even when individuals with genito-pelvic pain/penetration dis-\norder report sexual interest/motivation, there is often behavioral avoidance of sexual situ-\nations and opportunities. Avoidance of gynecological examinations despite medical\nrecommendations is also frequent. The pattern of avoidance is similar to that seen in phobic\ndisorders. It is common for women who have not succeeded in having sexual intercourse to\ncome for treatment only when they wish to conceive. Many women with genito-pelvic pain/\npenetration disorder will experience associated relationship/marital problems; they also of-\nten report that the symptoms significantly diminish their feelings of femininity. \nIn addition to the subtype “lifelong/acquired,” five factors should be considered dur-\ning assessment and diagnosis of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder because they\nmay be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner factors (e.g., partner’s sexual\nproblems, partner’s health status); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor communication, dis-\ncrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body\nimage, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression,\nanxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4) cultural/religious factors (e.g., inhi-\nbitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and\n5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Each of these factors may\ncontribute differently to the presenting symptoms of different women with this disorder.\nThere are no valid physiological measures of any of the component symptom dimen-\nsions of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder. Validated psychometric inventories may\nbe used to formally assess the pain and anxiety components related to genito-pelvic pain/\npenetration disorder.\nPrevalence \nThe prevalence of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder is unknown. However, approx-\nimately 15% of women in North America report recurrent pain during intercourse. Diffi-\nculties having intercourse appear to be a frequent referral to sexual dysfunction clinics and\nto specialist clinicians.\nGenito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder\n439\nDevelopment and Course \nThe development and course of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder is unclear. Because\nwomen generally do not seek treatment until they experience problems in sexual functioning,\nit can, in general, be difficult to characterize genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder as life-\nlong (primary) or acquired (secondary). Although women typically come to clinical atten-\ntion after the initiation of sexual activity, there are often earlier clinical signs. For example,\ndifficulty with or the avoidance of use of tampons is an important predictor of later problems.\nDifficulties with vaginal penetration (inability or fear or pain) may not be obvious until sex-\nual intercourse is attempted. Even once intercourse is attempted, the frequency of attempts\nmay not be significant or regular. In cases where it is difficult to establish whether symptom-\natology is lifelong or acquired, it is useful to determine the presence of any consistent period\nof successful pain-, fear-, and tension-free intercourse. If the experience of such a period can\nbe established, then genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder can be characterized as ac-\nquired. Once symptomatology is well established for a period of approximately 6 months,\nthe probability of spontaneous and significant symptomatic remission appears to diminish.\nComplaints related to genito-pelvic pain peak during early adulthood and in the peri-\nand postmenopausal period. Women with complaints about difficulty having intercourse\nappear to be primarily premenopausal. There may also be an increase in genito-pelvic\npain–related symptoms in the postpartum period.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nEnvironmental.\nSexual and/or physical abuse have often been cited as predictors of the\nDSM-IV-defined sexual pain disorders dyspareunia and vaginismus. This is a matter of con-\ntroversy in the current literature.\nGenetic and physiological.\nWomen experiencing superficial pain during sexual inter-\ncourse often report the onset of the pain after a history of vaginal infections. Even after the in-\nfections have resolved and there are no known residual physical findings, the pain persists.\nPain during tampon insertion or the inability to insert tampons before any sexual contact has\nbeen attempted is an important risk factor for genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues \nIn the past, inadequate sexual education and religious orthodoxy have often been consid-\nered to be culturally related predisposing factors to the DSM-IV diagnosis of vaginismus.\nThis perception appears to be confirmed by recent reports from Turkey, a primarily Mus-\nlim country, indicating a strikingly high prevalence for the disorder. However, most avail-\nable research, although limited in scope, does not support this notion (Lahaie et al. 2010). \nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nBy definition, the diagnosis of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder is only given to\nwomen. There is relatively new research concerning urological chronic pelvic pain syn-\ndrome in men, suggesting that men may experience some similar problems. The research\nand clinical experience are not sufficiently developed yet to justify the application of this\ndiagnosis to men. Other specified sexual dysfunction or unspecified sexual dysfunction\nmay be diagnosed in men appearing to fit this pattern.\nFunctional Consequences of \nGenito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder\nFunctional difficulties in genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder are often associated\nwith interference in relationship satisfaction and sometimes with the ability to conceive\nvia penile/vaginal intercourse. \n440\nSexual Dysfunctions\nDifferential Diagnosis\nAnother medical condition.\nIn many instances, women with genito-pelvic pain/pene-\ntration disorder will also be diagnosed with another medical condition (e.g., lichen scle-\nrosus, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, vulvovaginal atrophy). In some cases,\ntreating the medical condition may alleviate the genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder.\nMuch of the time, this is not the case. There are no reliable tools or diagnostic methods to\nallow clinicians to know whether the medical condition or genito-pelvic pain/penetration\ndisorder is primary. Often, the associated medical conditions are difficult to diagnose and\ntreat. For example, the increased incidence of postmenopausal pain during intercourse\nmay sometimes be attributable to vaginal dryness or vulvovaginal atrophy associated with\ndeclining estrogen levels. The relationship, however, between vulvovaginal atrophy/dry-\nness, estrogen, and pain is not well understood. \nSomatic symptom and related disorders.\nSome women with genito-pelvic pain/pene-\ntration disorder may also be diagnosable with somatic symptom disorder. Since both\ngenito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder and the somatic symptom and related disorders\nare new diagnoses, it is not yet clear whether they can be reliably differentiated. Some\nwomen diagnosed with genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder will also be diagnosed\nwith a specific phobia. \nInadequate sexual stimuli.\nIt is important that the clinician, in considering differential diag-\nnoses, assess the adequacy of sexual stimuli within the woman’s sexual experience. Sexual sit-\nuations in which there is inadequate foreplay or arousal may lead to difficulties in penetration,\npain, or avoidance. Erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation in the male partner may\nresult in difficulties with penetration. These conditions should be carefully assessed. In some\nsituations, a diagnosis of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder may not be appropriate. \nComorbidity\nComorbidity between genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder and other sexual difficul-\nties appears to be common. Comorbidity with relationship distress is also common. This is\nnot surprising, since in Western cultures the inability to have (pain-free) intercourse with\na desired partner and the avoidance of sexual opportunities may be either a contributing\nfactor to or the result of other sexual or relationship problems. Because pelvic floor symp-\ntoms are implicated in the diagnosis of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder, there is\nlikely to be a higher prevalence of other disorders related to the pelvic floor or reproduc-\ntive organs (e.g., interstitial cystitis, constipation, vaginal infection, endometriosis, irrita-\nble bowel syndrome).", "provenance": {"source_file": "sexual_dysfunctions_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 5, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.534324"}}

A “desire discrepancy,” in which a man has\nlower desire for sexual activity than his partner, is not sufficient to diagnose male hypo-\nactive sexual desire disorder. Both low/absent desire for sex and deficient/absent sexual\nthoughts or fantasies are required for a diagnosis of the disorder. There may be variation\nacross men in how sexual desire is expressed. \nThe lack of desire for sex and deficient/absent erotic thoughts or fantasies must be per-\nsistent or recurrent and must occur for a minimum duration of approximately 6 months.\nThe inclusion of this duration criterion is meant to safeguard against making a diagnosis in\ncases in which a man’s low sexual desire may represent an adaptive response to adverse\nlife conditions (e.g., concern about a partner’s pregnancy when the man is considering ter-\nminating the relationship). The introduction of “approximately” in Criterion B allows for\nclinician judgment in cases in which symptom duration does not meet the recommended\n6-month threshold.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis \nMale hypoactive sexual desire disorder is sometimes associated with erectile and/or ejac-\nulatory concerns. For example, persistent difficulties obtaining an erection may lead a man\nto lose interest in sexual activity. Men with hypoactive sexual desire disorder often report\nthat they no longer initiate sexual activity and that they are minimally receptive to a part-\nner’s attempt to initiate. Sexual activities (e.g., masturbation or partnered sexual activity)\nmay sometimes occur even in the presence of low sexual desire. Relationship-specific pref-\nerences regarding patterns of sexual initiation must be taken into account when making a\ndiagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Although men are more likely to ini-\ntiate sexual activity, and thus low desire may be characterized by a pattern of non-initiation,\nmany men may prefer to have their partner initiate sexual activity. In such situations, the\nman’s lack of receptivity to a partner’s initiation should be considered when evaluating low\ndesire.\nIn addition to the subtypes “lifelong/acquired” and “generalized/situational,” the fol-\nlowing five factors must be considered during assessment and diagnosis of male hypo-\nactive sexual desire disorder given that they may be relevant to etiology and/or treatment:\n1) partner factors (e.g., partner’s sexual problems, partner’s health status); 2) relationship\nfactors (e.g., poor communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individ-\nual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psy-\nchiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression, anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement);\n4) cultural/religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity;\nattitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treat-\n442\nSexual Dysfunctions\nment. Each of these factors may contribute differently to the presenting symptoms of dif-\nferent men with this disorder. \nPrevalence \nThe prevalence of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder varies depending on country of\norigin and method of assessment. Approximately 6% of younger men (ages 18–24 years)\nand 41% of older men (ages 66–74 years) have problems with sexual desire. However, a\npersistent lack of interest in sex, lasting 6 months or more, affects only a small proportion\nof men ages 16–44 (1.8%). \nDevelopment and Course \nBy definition, lifelong male hypoactive sexual desire disorder indicates that low or no sex-\nual desire has always been present, whereas the acquired subtype would be assigned if the\nman’s low desire developed after a period of normal sexual desire. There is a requirement\nthat low desire persist for approximately 6 months or more; thus, short-term changes in\nsexual desire should not be diagnosed as male hypoactive sexual desire disorder. \nThere is a normative age-related decline in sexual desire. Like women, men identify a\nvariety of triggers for their sexual desire, and they describe a wide range of reasons that\nthey choose to engage in sexual activity. Although erotic visual cues may be more potent\nelicitors of desire in younger men, the potency of sexual cues may decrease with age and\nmust be considered when evaluating men for hypoactive sexual desire disorder. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nTemperamental.\nMood and anxiety symptoms appear to be strong predictors of low de-\nsire in men. Up to half of men with a past history of psychiatric symptoms may have mod-\nerate or severe loss of desire, compared with only 15% of those without such a history. A\nman’s feelings about himself, his perception of his partner’s sexual desire toward him,\nfeelings of being emotionally connected, and contextual variables may all negatively (as\nwell as positively) affect sexual desire.\nEnvironmental.\nAlcohol use may increase the occurrence of low desire. Among gay men,\nself-directed homophobia, interpersonal problems, attitudes, lack of adequate sex educa-\ntion, and trauma resulting from early life experiences must be taken into account in ex-\nplaining the low desire. Social and cultural contextual factors should also be considered.\nGenetic and physiological.\nEndocrine disorders such as hyperprolactinemia signifi-\ncantly affect sexual desire in men. Age is a significant risk factor for low desire in men. It is\nunclear whether or not men with low desire also have abnormally low levels of testoster-\none; however, among hypogonadal men, low desire is common. There also may be a crit-\nical threshold below which testosterone will affect sexual desire in men and above which\nthere is little effect of testosterone on men’s desire. \nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues \nThere is marked variability in prevalence rates of low desire across cultures, ranging from\n12.5% in Northern European men to 28% in Southeast Asian men ages 40–80 years. Just as\nthere are higher rates of low desire among East Asian subgroups of women, men of East\nAsian ancestry also have higher rates of low desire. Guilt about sex may mediate this as-\nsociation between East Asian ethnicity and sexual desire in men.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nIn contrast to the classification of sexual disorders in women, desire and arousal disorders\nhave been retained as separate constructs in men. Despite some similarities in the experi-\nPremature (Early) Ejaculation\n443\nence of desire across men and women, and the fact that desire fluctuates over time and is\ndependent on contextual factors, men do report a significantly higher intensity and fre-\nquency of sexual desire compared with women.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nNonsexual mental disorders.\nNonsexual mental disorders, such as major depressive\ndisorder, which is characterized by “markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or al-\nmost all, activities,” may explain the lack of sexual desire. If the lack of desire is better\nexplained by another mental disorder, then a diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire\ndisorder would not be made. \nSubstance/medication use.\nSubstance/medication use may explain the lack of sexual\ndesire.\nAnother medical condition.\nIf the low/absent desire and deficient/absent erotic thoughts\nor fantasies are better explained by the effects of another medical condition (e.g., hypogo-\nnadism, diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, central nervous system disease), then a di-\nagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder would not be made. \nInterpersonal factors.\nIf interpersonal or significant contextual factors, such as severe\nrelationship distress or other significant stressors, are associated with the loss of desire in\nthe man, then a diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder would not be made.\nOther sexual dysfunctions.\nThe presence of another sexual dysfunction does not rule out a\ndiagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder; there is some evidence that up to one-half\nof men with low sexual desire also have erectile difficulties, and slightly fewer may also have\nearly ejaculation difficulties. If the man’s low desire is explained by self-identification as an\nasexual, then a diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder is not made. \nComorbidity\nDepression and other mental disorders, as well as endocrinological factors, are often co-\nmorbid with male hypoactive sexual desire disorder.", "provenance": {"source_file": "sexual_dysfunctions_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 6, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.534324"}}

The sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder or as a\nconsequence of severe relationship distress or other significant stressors and is not at-\ntributable to the effects of a substance/medication or another medical condition.\nSpecify whether:\nLifelong: The disturbance has been present since the individual became sexually active.\nAcquired: The disturbance began after a period of relatively normal sexual function.\n444\nSexual Dysfunctions\nSpecify whether:\nGeneralized: Not limited to certain types of stimulation, situations, or partners.\nSituational: Only occurs with certain types of stimulation, situations, or partners.\nSpecify current severity:\nMild: Ejaculation occurring within approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute of vaginal\npenetration.\nModerate: Ejaculation occurring within approximately 15–30 seconds of vaginal pen-\netration.\nSevere: Ejaculation occurring prior to sexual activity, at the start of sexual activity, or\nwithin approximately 15 seconds of vaginal penetration.\nDiagnostic Features\nPremature (early) ejaculation is manifested by ejaculation that occurs prior to or shortly af-\nter vaginal penetration, operationalized by an individual’s estimate of ejaculatory latency\n(i.e., elapsed time before ejaculation) after vaginal penetration. Estimated and measured\nintravaginal ejaculatory latencies are highly correlated as long as the ejaculatory latency is\nof short duration; therefore, self-reported estimates of ejaculatory latency are sufficient for\ndiagnostic purposes. A 60-second intravaginal ejaculatory latency time is an appropriate\ncutoff for the diagnosis of lifelong premature (early) ejaculation in heterosexual men.\nThere are insufficient data to determine if this duration criterion can be applied to ac-\nquired premature (early) ejaculation. The durational definition may apply to males of\nvarying sexual orientations, since ejaculatory latencies appear to be similar across men of\ndifferent sexual orientations and across different sexual activities. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nMany males with premature (early) ejaculation complain of a sense of lack of control over\nejaculation and report apprehension about their anticipated inability to delay ejaculation\non future sexual encounters.\nThe following factors may be relevant in the evaluation of any sexual dysfunction:\n1) partner factors (e.g., partner’s sexual problems, partner’s health status); 2) relationship fac-\ntors (e.g., poor communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual\nvulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric\ncomorbidity (e.g., depression, anxiety), and stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4) cultural/\nreligious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes\ntoward sexuality); and 5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment.\nPrevalence\nEstimates of the prevalence of premature (early) ejaculation vary widely depending on the\ndefinition utilized. Internationally, more than 20%–30% of men ages 18–70 years report\nconcern about how rapidly they ejaculate. With the new definition of premature (early)\nejaculation (i.e., ejaculation occurring within approximately 1 minute of vaginal penetra-\ntion), only 1%–3% of men would be diagnosed with the disorder. Prevalence of premature\n(early) ejaculation may increase with age.\nDevelopment and Course\nBy definition, lifelong premature (early) ejaculation starts during a male’s initial sexual ex-\nperiences and persists thereafter. Some men may experience premature (early) ejaculation\nduring their initial sexual encounters but gain ejaculatory control over time. It is the persis-\ntence of ejaculatory problems for longer than 6 months that determines the diagnosis of pre-\nmature (early) ejaculation. In contrast, some men develop the disorder after a period of\nPremature (Early) Ejaculation\n445\nhaving a normal ejaculatory latency, known as acquired premature (early) ejaculation. There is\nfar less known about acquired premature (early) ejaculation than about lifelong premature\n(early) ejaculation. The acquired form likely has a later onset, usually appearing during or af-\nter the fourth decade of life. Lifelong is relatively stable throughout life. Little is known about\nthe course of acquired premature (early) ejaculation. Reversal of medical conditions such as\nhyperthyroidism and prostatitis appears to restore ejaculatory latencies to baseline values.\nLifelong premature (early) ejaculation begins with early sexual experiences and persists\nthroughout an individual’s life. In approximately 20% of men with premature (early) ejacu-\nlation, ejaculatory latencies decrease further with age. Age and relationship length have been\nfound to be negatively associated with prevalence of premature (early) ejaculation.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nTemperamental.\nPremature (early) ejaculation may be more common in men with anx-\niety disorders, especially social anxiety disorder (social phobia).\nGenetic and physiological.\nThere is a moderate genetic contribution to lifelong prema-\nture (early) ejaculation. Premature (early) ejaculation may be associated with dopamine\ntransporter gene polymorphism or serotonin transporter gene polymorphism. Thyroid\ndisease, prostatitis, and drug withdrawal are associated with acquired premature (early)\nejaculation. Positron emission tomography measures of regional cerebral blood flow dur-\ning ejaculation have shown primary activation in the mesocephalic transition zone, includ-\ning the ventral tegmental area.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nPerception of what constitutes a normal ejaculatory latency is different in many cultures.\nMeasured ejaculatory latencies may differ in some countries. Such differences may be ex-\nplained by cultural or religious factors as well as genetic differences between populations.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nPremature (early) ejaculation is a sexual disorder in males. Males and their sexual partners\nmay differ in their perception of what constitutes an acceptable ejaculatory latency. There\nmay be increasing concerns in females about early ejaculation in their sexual partners,\nwhich may be a reflection of changing societal attitudes concerning female sexual activity. \nDiagnostic Markers\nEjaculatory latency is usually monitored in research settings by the sexual partner utilizing\na timing device (e.g., stopwatch), though this is not ideal in real-life sexual situations. For\nvaginal intercourse, the time between intravaginal penetration and ejaculation is measured. \nFunctional Consequences of \nPremature (Early) Ejaculation\nA pattern of premature (early) ejaculation may be associated with decreased self-esteem, a\nsense of lack of control, and adverse consequences for partner relationships. It may also\ncause personal distress in the sexual partner and decreased sexual satisfaction in the sexual\npartner. Ejaculation prior to penetration may be associated with difficulties in conception.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nSubstance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction.\nWhen problems with premature\nejaculation are due exclusively to substance use, intoxication, or withdrawal, substance/\nmedication-induced sexual dysfunction should be diagnosed.\n446\nSexual Dysfunctions\nEjaculatory concerns that do not meet diagnostic criteria.\nIt is necessary to identify\nmales with normal ejaculatory latencies who desire longer ejaculatory latencies and males\nwho have episodic premature (early) ejaculation (e.g., during the first sexual encounter\nwith a new partner when a short ejaculatory latency may be common or normative). Neither\nof these situations would lead to a diagnosis of premature (early) ejaculation, even though\nthese situations may be distressing to some males.\nComorbidity \nPremature (early) ejaculation may be associated with erectile problems. In many cases, it\nmay be difficult to determine which difficulty preceded the other. Lifelong premature\n(early) ejaculation may be associated with certain anxiety disorders. Acquired premature\n(early) ejaculation may be associated with prostatitis, thyroid disease, or drug withdrawal\n(e.g., during opioid withdrawal).", "provenance": {"source_file": "sexual_dysfunctions_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 7, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.534324"}}

A clinically significant disturbance in sexual function is predominant in the clinical picture.\nB. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both\n(1) and (2):\n1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication\nor withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.\n2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Crite-\nrion A.\nC. The disturbance is not better explained by a sexual dysfunction that is not substance/\nmedication-induced. Such evidence of an independent sexual dysfunction could in-\nclude the following:\nThe symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms\npersist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of\nacute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the\nexistence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunc-\ntion (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes). \nD. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.\nE. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress in the individual.\nNote: This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or\nsubstance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical\npicture and are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.\nCoding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medica-\ntion]-induced sexual dysfunctions are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM\ncode depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the\nsame class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-\ninduced sexual dysfunction, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record\n“mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced sexual dysfunction (e.g., “mild\ncocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced sexual dysfunction”). If a moderate or severe\nsubstance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sexual dysfunction, the 4th\nposition character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder”\nor “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction\n447\nuse disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy\nuse of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record\nonly the substance-induced sexual dysfunction.\nSpecify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders” for di-\nagnoses associated with substance class):\nWith onset during intoxication: If the criteria are met for intoxication with the sub-\nstance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.\nWith onset during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance\nand the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.\nWith onset after medication use: Symptoms may appear either at initiation of medi-\ncation or after a modification or change in use.\nSpecify current severity:\nMild: Occurs on 25%–50% of occasions of sexual activity.\nModerate: Occurs on 50%–75% of occasions of sexual activity.\nSevere: Occurs on 75% or more of occasions of sexual activity.\nRecording Procedures\nICD-9-CM.\nThe name of the substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction begins\nwith the specific substance (e.g., alcohol, fluoxetine) that is presumed to be causing the\nsexual dysfunction. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria\nset, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes\n(e.g., fluoxetine), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a\nsubstance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is un-\nknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used.\nThe name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during in-\ntoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset after medication use), followed by the se-\nverity specifier (e.g., mild, moderate, severe). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-\nCM, which combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a sin-\ngle code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder.\nFor example, in the case of erectile dysfunction occurring during intoxication in a man\nwith a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is 291.89 alcohol-induced sexual dysfunc-\ntion, with onset during intoxication, moderate. An additional diagnosis of 303.90 severe\nalcohol use disorder is also given.

The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria\nset, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use\ndisorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., fluoxetine), the code for\n“other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an eti-\nological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown sub-\nstance” should be used.\nWhen recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any)\nis listed first, followed by the word “with,” followed by the name of the substance-induced\nsexual dysfunction, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication,\nonset during withdrawal, with onset after medication use), followed by the severity spec-\nifier (e.g., mild, moderate, severe). For example, in the case of erectile dysfunction occur-\nring during intoxication in a man with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is\nF10.281 moderate alcohol use disorder with alcohol-induced sexual dysfunction, with on-\nset during intoxication, moderate. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe alcohol use\ndisorder is not given. If the substance-induced sexual dysfunction occurs without a co-\nmorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no ac-\ncompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F15.981 amphetamine-induced sexual\ndysfunction, with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to\nplay a significant role in the development of the sexual dysfunction, each should be listed\nseparately (e.g., F14.181 mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced sexual dysfunc-\ntion, with onset during intoxication, moderate; F19.981 fluoxetine-induced sexual dys-\nfunction, with onset after medication use, moderate). \nDiagnostic Features\nThe major feature is a disturbance in sexual function that has a temporal relationship with\nsubstance/medication initiation, dose increase, or substance/medication discontinuation.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nSexual dysfunctions can occur in association with intoxication with the following classes of\nsubstances: alcohol; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulants (including co-\ncaine); and other (or unknown) substances. Sexual dysfunctions can occur in association\nwith withdrawal from the following classes of substances: alcohol; opioids; sedatives, hyp-\nnotics, or anxiolytics; and other (or unknown) substances. Medications that can induce sex-\nual dysfunctions include antidepressants, antipsychotics, and hormonal contraceptives.\nThe most commonly reported side effect of antidepressant drugs is difficulty with or-\ngasm or ejaculation. Problems with desire and erection are less frequent. Approximately\n30% of sexual complaints are clinically significant. Certain agents, such as bupropion and\nmirtazapine, appear not to be associated with sexual side effects. \nThe sexual problems associated with antipsychotic drugs, including problems with\nsexual desire, erection, lubrication, ejaculation, or orgasm, have occurred with typical as\nwell as atypical agents. However, problems are less common with prolactin-sparing anti-\npsychotics than with agents that cause significant prolactin elevation.\nAlthough the effects of mood stabilizers on sexual function are unclear, it is possible\nthat lithium and anticonvulsants, with the possible exception of lamotrigine, have adverse\neffects on sexual desire. Problems with orgasm may occur with gabapentin. Similarly, there\nmay be a higher prevalence of erectile and orgasmic problems associated with benzodiaz-\nepines. There have not been such reports with buspirone.\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction\n449\nMany nonpsychiatric medications, such as cardiovascular, cytotoxic, gastrointestinal,\nand hormonal agents, are associated with disturbances in sexual function. Illicit substance\nuse is associated with decreased sexual desire, erectile dysfunction, and difficulty reach-\ning orgasm. Sexual dysfunctions are also seen in individuals receiving methadone but are\nseldom reported by patients receiving buprenorphine. Chronic alcohol abuse and chronic\nnicotine abuse are associated with erectile problems.\nPrevalence\nThe prevalence and the incidence of substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction\nare unclear, likely because of underreporting of treatment-emergent sexual side effects.\nData on substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction typically concern the effects of\nantidepressant drugs. The prevalence of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction var-\nies in part depending on the specific agent. Approximately 25%–80% of individuals taking\nmonoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonergic antidepressants,\nand combined serotonergic-adrenergic antidepressants report sexual side effects. There\nare differences in the incidence of sexual side effects between some serotonergic and com-\nbined adrenergic-serotonergic antidepressants, although it is unclear if these differences\nare clinically significant.\nApproximately 50% of individuals taking antipsychotic medications will experience\nadverse sexual side effects, including problems with sexual desire, erection, lubrication,\nejaculation, or orgasm. The incidence of these side effects among different antipsychotic\nagents is unclear.\nExact prevalence and incidence of sexual dysfunctions among users of nonpsychiatric\nmedications such as cardiovascular, cytotoxic, gastrointestinal, and hormonal agents are\nunknown. Elevated rates of sexual dysfunction have been reported with methadone or\nhigh-dose opioid drugs for pain. There are increased rates of decreased sexual desire, erec-\ntile dysfunction, and difficulty reaching orgasm associated with illicit substance use. The\nprevalence of sexual problems appears related to chronic drug abuse and appears higher\nin individuals who abuse heroin (approximately 60%–70%) than in individuals who abuse\namphetamines or 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (i.e., MDMA, ecstasy). Elevated\nrates of sexual dysfunction are also seen in individuals receiving methadone but are sel-\ndom reported by patients receiving buprenorphine. Chronic alcohol abuse and chronic\nnicotine abuse are related to higher rates of erectile problems.\nDevelopment and Course\nThe onset of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction may be as early as 8 days after the\nagent is first taken. Approximately 30% of individuals with mild to moderate orgasm de-\nlay will experience spontaneous remission of the dysfunction within 6 months. In some\ncases, serotonin reuptake inhibitor–induced sexual dysfunction may persist after the\nagent is discontinued. The time to onset of sexual dysfunction after initiation of antipsy-\nchotic drugs or drugs of abuse is unknown. It is probable that the adverse effects of nico-\ntine and alcohol may not appear until after years of use. Premature (early) ejaculation can\nsometimes occur after cessation of opioid use. There is some evidence that disturbances in\nsexual function related to substance/medication use increase with age. \nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nThere may be an interaction among cultural factors, the influence of medications on sexual\nfunctioning, and the response of the individual to those changes.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nSome gender differences in sexual side effects may exist. \n450\nSexual Dysfunctions\nFunctional Consequences of \nSubstance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction\nMedication-induced sexual dysfunction may result in medication noncompliance.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nNon-substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunctions.\nMany mental conditions, such\nas depressive, bipolar, anxiety, and psychotic disorders, are associated with disturbances\nof sexual function. Thus, differentiating a substance/medication-induced sexual dys-\nfunction from a manifestation of the underlying mental disorder can be quite difficult. The\ndiagnosis is usually established if a close relationship between substance/medication ini-\ntiation or discontinuation is observed. A clear diagnosis can be established if the problem\noccurs after substance/medication initiation, dissipates with substance/medication dis-\ncontinuation, and recurs with introduction of the same agent. Most substance/medication-in-\nduced side effects occur shortly after initiation or discontinuation. Sexual side effects that\nonly occur after chronic use of a substance/medication may be extremely difficult to di-\nagnose with certainty.", "provenance": {"source_file": "sexual_dysfunctions_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 8, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.534324"}}
