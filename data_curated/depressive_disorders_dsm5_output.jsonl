Severe recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally (e.g., verbal rages) and/or be-\nhaviorally (e.g., physical aggression toward people or property) that are grossly out of\nproportion in intensity or duration to the situation or provocation. \nB. The temper outbursts are inconsistent with developmental level.\nC. The temper outbursts occur, on average, three or more times per week.\nD. The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day,\nnearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers).\nE. Criteria A–D have been present for 12 or more months. Throughout that time, the indi-\nvidual has not had a period lasting 3 or more consecutive months without all of the\nsymptoms in Criteria A–D.\nF. Criteria A and D are present in at least two of three settings (i.e., at home, at school,\nwith peers) and are severe in at least one of these.\nG. The diagnosis should not be made for the first time before age 6 years or after age 18\nyears. \nH. By history or observation, the age at onset of Criteria A–E is before 10 years.\nI.\nThere has never been a distinct period lasting more than 1 day during which the full\nsymptom criteria, except duration, for a manic or hypomanic episode have been met.\nNote: Developmentally appropriate mood elevation, such as occurs in the context of a\nhighly positive event or its anticipation, should not be considered as a symptom of ma-\nnia or hypomania.\nJ. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during an episode of major depressive disorder\nand are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., autism spectrum disor-\nder, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety disorder, persistent depressive\ndisorder [dysthymia]).\nNote: This diagnosis cannot coexist with oppositional defiant disorder, intermittent ex-\nplosive disorder, or bipolar disorder, though it can coexist with others, including major\ndepressive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and\nsubstance use disorders. Individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for both disruptive\nmood dysregulation disorder and oppositional defiant disorder should only be given the\ndiagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. If an individual has ever experi-\nenced a manic or hypomanic episode, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation\ndisorder should not be assigned. \nK. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or to an-\nother medical or neurological condition.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe core feature of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is chronic, severe persistent ir-\nritability. This severe irritability has two prominent clinical manifestations, the first of\nwhich is frequent temper outbursts. These outbursts typically occur in response to frus-\ntration and can be verbal or behavioral (the latter in the form of aggression against prop-\nerty, self, or others). They must occur frequently (i.e., on average, three or more times per\nweek) (Criterion C) over at least 1 year in at least two settings (Criteria E and F), such as in\nthe home and at school, and they must be developmentally inappropriate (Criterion B).\nThe second manifestation of severe irritability consists of chronic, persistently irritable or\nangry mood that is present between the severe temper outbursts. This irritable or angry\nmood must be characteristic of the child, being present most of the day, nearly every day,\nand noticeable by others in the child’s environment (Criterion D). \nDisruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder\n157\nThe clinical presentation of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder must be carefully\ndistinguished from presentations of other, related conditions, particularly pediatric bi-\npolar disorder. In fact, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder was added to DSM-5 to\naddress the considerable concern about the appropriate classification and treatment of\nchildren who present with chronic, persistent irritability relative to children who present\nwith classic (i.e., episodic) bipolar disorder. \nSome researchers view severe, non-episodic irritability as characteristic of bipolar dis-\norder in children, although both DSM-IV and DSM-5 require that both children and adults\nhave distinct episodes of mania or hypomania to qualify for the diagnosis of bipolar I dis-\norder. During the latter decades of the 20th century, this contention by researchers that\nsevere, nonepisodic irritability is a manifestation of pediatric mania coincided with an up-\nsurge in the rates at which clinicians assigned the diagnosis of bipolar disorder to their\npediatric patients. This sharp increase in rates appears to be attributable to clinicians com-\nbining at least two clinical presentations into a single category. That is, both classic, epi-\nsodic presentations of mania and non-episodic presentations of severe irritability have\nbeen labeled as bipolar disorder in children. In DSM-5, the term bipolar disorder is explicitly\nreserved for episodic presentations of bipolar symptoms. DSM-IV did not include a diagno-\nsis designed to capture youths whose hallmark symptoms consisted of very severe, non-\nepisodic irritability, whereas DSM-5, with the inclusion of disruptive mood dysregulation\ndisorder, provides a distinct category for such presentations. \nPrevalence\nDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder is common among children presenting to pedi-\natric mental health clinics. Prevalence estimates of the disorder in the community are un-\nclear. Based on rates of chronic and severe persistent irritability, which is the core feature\nof the disorder, the overall 6-month to 1-year period-prevalence of disruptive mood dys-\nregulation disorder among children and adolescents probably falls in the 2%–5% range.\nHowever, rates are expected to be higher in males and school-age children than in females\nand adolescents. \nDevelopment and Course\nThe onset of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder must be before age 10 years, and the\ndiagnosis should not be applied to children with a developmental age of less than 6 years.\nIt is unknown whether the condition presents only in this age-delimited fashion. Because\nthe symptoms of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are likely to change as children\nmature, use of the diagnosis should be restricted to age groups similar to those in which\nvalidity has been established (7–18 years). Approximately half of children with severe,\nchronic irritability will have a presentation that continues to meet criteria for the condition\n1 year later. Rates of conversion from severe, nonepisodic irritability to bipolar disorder\nare very low. Instead, children with chronic irritability are at risk to develop unipolar de-\npressive and/or anxiety disorders in adulthood. \nAge-related variations also differentiate classic bipolar disorder and disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder. Rates of bipolar disorder generally are very low prior to adoles-\ncence (<1%), with a steady increase into early adulthood (1%–2% prevalence). Disruptive\nmood dysregulation disorder is more common than bipolar disorder prior to adolescence,\nand symptoms of the condition generally become less common as children transition into\nadulthood. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nTemperamental.\nChildren with chronic irritability typically exhibit complicated psy-\nchiatric histories. In such children, a relatively extensive history of chronic irritability is\n158\nDepressive Disorders\ncommon, typically manifesting before full criteria for the syndrome are met. Such predi-\nagnostic presentations may have qualified for a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder.\nMany children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder have symptoms that also\nmeet criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and for an anxiety dis-\norder, with such diagnoses often being present from a relatively early age. For some chil-\ndren, the criteria for major depressive disorder may also be met. \nGenetic and physiological.\nIn terms of familial aggregation and genetics, it has been\nsuggested that children presenting with chronic, non-episodic irritability can be differen-\ntiated from children with bipolar disorder in their family-based risk. However, these two\ngroups do not differ in familial rates of anxiety disorders, unipolar depressive disorders,\nor substance abuse. Compared with children with pediatric bipolar disorder or other men-\ntal illnesses, those with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder exhibit both commonal-\nities and differences in information-processing deficits. For example, face-emotion\nlabeling deficits, as well as perturbed decision making and cognitive control, are present in\nchildren with bipolar disorder and chronically irritable children, as well as in children\nwith some other psychiatric conditions. There is also evidence for disorder-specific dys-\nfunction, such as during tasks assessing attention deployment in response to emotional\nstimuli, which has demonstrated unique signs of dysfunction in children with chronic ir-\nritability. \nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nChildren presenting to clinics with features of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are\npredominantly male. Among community samples, a male preponderance appears to be\nsupported. This difference in prevalence between males and females differentiates disrup-\ntive mood dysregulation disorder from bipolar disorder, in which there is an equal gender\nprevalence.\nSuicide Risk\nIn general, evidence documenting suicidal behavior and aggression, as well as other se-\nvere functional consequences, in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be noted\nwhen evaluating children with chronic irritability. \nFunctional Consequences of \nDisruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder\nChronic, severe irritability, such as is seen in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, is\nassociated with marked disruption in a child’s family and peer relationships, as well as in\nschool performance. Because of their extremely low frustration tolerance, such children\ngenerally have difficulty succeeding in school; they are often unable to participate in the\nactivities typically enjoyed by healthy children; their family life is severely disrupted by\ntheir outbursts and irritability; and they have trouble initiating or sustaining friendships.\nLevels of dysfunction in children with bipolar disorder and disruptive mood dysregulation\ndisorder are generally comparable. Both conditions cause severe disruption in the lives of\nthe affected individual and their families. In both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder\nand pediatric bipolar disorder, dangerous behavior, suicidal ideation or suicide attempts,\nsevere aggression, and psychiatric hospitalization are common.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nBecause chronically irritable children and adolescents typically present with complex histo-\nries, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder must be made while consid-\nering the presence or absence of multiple other conditions. Despite the need to consider\nDisruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder\n159\nmany other syndromes, differentiation of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from bi-\npolar disorder and oppositional defiant disorder requires particularly careful assessment. \nBipolar disorders.\nThe central feature differentiating disruptive mood dysregulation disor-\nder and bipolar disorders in children involves the longitudinal course of the core symptoms. In\nchildren, as in adults, bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder manifest as an episodic illness\nwith discrete episodes of mood perturbation that can be differentiated from the child’s typical\npresentation. The mood perturbation that occurs during a manic episode is distinctly different\nfrom the child’s usual mood. In addition, during a manic episode, the change in mood must be\naccompanied by the onset, or worsening, of associated cognitive, behavioral, and physical\nsymptoms (e.g., distractibility, increased goal-directed activity), which are also present to a de-\ngree that is distinctly different from the child’s usual baseline. Thus, in the case of a manic ep-\nisode, parents (and, depending on developmental level, children) should be able to identify a\ndistinct time period during which the child’s mood and behavior were markedly different\nfrom usual. In contrast, the irritability of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is persistent\nand is present over many months; while it may wax and wane to a certain degree, severe irri-\ntability is characteristic of the child with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Thus, while\nbipolar disorders are episodic conditions, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is not. In\nfact, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder cannot be assigned to a child\nwho has ever experienced a full-duration hypomanic or manic episode (irritable or euphoric)\nor who has ever had a manic or hypomanic episode lasting more than 1 day. Another central\ndifferentiating feature between bipolar disorders and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder\nis the presence of elevated or expansive mood and grandiosity. These symptoms are common\nfeatures of mania but are not characteristic of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. \nOppositional defiant disorder.\nWhile symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder typi-\ncally do occur in children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, mood symptoms\nof disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are relatively rare in children with opposi-\ntional defiant disorder. The key features that warrant the diagnosis of disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder in children whose symptoms also meet criteria for oppositional de-\nfiant disorder are the presence of severe and frequently recurrent outbursts and a persis-\ntent disruption in mood between outbursts. In addition, the diagnosis of disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder requires severe impairment in at least one setting (i.e., home,\nschool, or among peers) and mild to moderate impairment in a second setting. For this rea-\nson, while most children whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregula-\ntion disorder will also have a presentation that meets criteria for oppositional defiant\ndisorder, the reverse is not the case. That is, in only approximately 15% of individuals with\noppositional defiant disorder would criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder\nbe met. Moreover, even for children in whom criteria for both disorders are met, only the\ndiagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made. Finally, both the\nprominent mood symptoms in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and the high risk\nfor depressive and anxiety disorders in follow-up studies justify placement of disruptive\nmood dysregulation disorder among the depressive disorders in DSM-5. (Oppositional\ndefiant disorder is included in the chapter “Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct\nDisorders.”) This reflects the more prominent mood component among individuals with\ndisruptive mood dysregulation disorder, as compared with individuals with oppositional\ndefiant disorder. Nevertheless, it also should be noted that disruptive mood dysregulation\ndisorder appears to carry a high risk for behavioral problems as well as mood problems.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders,\nand autism spectrum disorder.\nUnlike children diagnosed with bipolar disorder or op-\npositional defiant disorder, a child whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder also can receive a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD, major depressive\ndisorder, and/or anxiety disorder. However, children whose irritability is present only in\nthe context of a major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)\n160\nDepressive Disorders\nshould receive one of those diagnoses rather than disruptive mood dysregulation disor-\nder. Children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder may have symptoms that also\nmeet criteria for an anxiety disorder and can receive both diagnoses, but children whose ir-\nritability is manifest only in the context of exacerbation of an anxiety disorder should re-\nceive the relevant anxiety disorder diagnosis rather than disruptive mood dysregulation\ndisorder. In addition, children with autism spectrum disorders frequently present with\ntemper outbursts when, for example, their routines are disturbed. In that instance, the\ntemper outbursts would be considered secondary to the autism spectrum disorder, and\nthe child should not receive the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. \nIntermittent explosive disorder.\nChildren with symptoms suggestive of intermittent\nexplosive disorder present with instances of severe temper outbursts, much like children\nwith disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. However, unlike disruptive mood dysreg-\nulation disorder, intermittent explosive disorder does not require persistent disruption in\nmood between outbursts. In addition, intermittent explosive disorder requires only 3 months\nof active symptoms, in contrast to the 12-month requirement for disruptive mood dys-\nregulation disorder. Thus, these two diagnoses should not be made in the same child. For\nchildren with outbursts and intercurrent, persistent irritability, only the diagnosis of dis-\nruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made. \nComorbidity\nRates of comorbidity in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are extremely high. It is\nrare to find individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation\ndisorder alone. Comorbidity between disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and other\nDSM-defined syndromes appears higher than for many other pediatric mental illnesses;\nthe strongest overlap is with oppositional defiant disorder. Not only is the overall rate of\ncomorbidity high in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, but also the range of comor-\nbid illnesses appears particularly diverse. These children typically present to the clinic\nwith a wide range of disruptive behavior, mood, anxiety, and even autism spectrum\nsymptoms and diagnoses. However, children with disruptive mood dysregulation disor-\nder should not have symptoms that meet criteria for bipolar disorder, as in that context,\nonly the bipolar disorder diagnosis should be made. If children have symptoms that meet\ncriteria for oppositional defiant disorder or intermittent explosive disorder and disruptive\nmood dysregulation disorder, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disor-\nder should be assigned. Also, as noted earlier, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregu-\nlation disorder should not be assigned if the symptoms occur only in an anxiety-\nprovoking context, when the routines of a child with autism spectrum disorder or obses-\nsive-compulsive disorder are disturbed, or in the context of a major depressive episode.", "provenance": {"source_file": "depressive_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 1, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.442385"}}

Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation with-\nout a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.\nB.

The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or to another\nmedical condition. \nNote: Criteria A–C represent a major depressive episode.\nNote: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a nat-\nural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense sad-\nness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion A,\nwhich may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms may be understand-\nable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive episode in\naddition to the normal response to a significant loss should also be carefully considered. This\ndecision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual’s history\nand the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss.1\nD. The occurrence of the major depressive episode is not better explained by schizoaf-\nfective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or\nother specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.\nE. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode.\nNote: This exclusion does not apply if all of the manic-like or hypomanic-like episodes\nare substance-induced or are attributable to the physiological effects of another med-\nical condition.\n1In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that in\ngrief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss, while in MDE it is persistent\ndepressed mood and the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is\nlikely to decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of\ngrief. These waves tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The\ndepressed mood of MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations.\nThe pain of grief may be accompanied by positive emotions and humor that are uncharacteristic\nof the pervasive unhappiness and misery characteristic of MDE. The thought content associated\nwith grief generally features a preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the deceased,\nrather than the self-critical or pessimistic ruminations seen in MDE. In grief, self-esteem is gener-\nally preserved, whereas in MDE feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common. If self-\nderogatory ideation is present in grief, it typically involves perceived failings vis-à-vis the\ndeceased (e.g., not visiting frequently enough, not telling the deceased how much he or she was\nloved). If a bereaved individual thinks about death and dying, such thoughts are generally\nfocused on the deceased and possibly about “joining” the deceased, whereas in MDE such\nthoughts are focused on ending one’s own life because of feeling worthless, undeserving of life,\nor unable to cope with the pain of depression.\n162\nDepressive Disorders\nCoding and Recording Procedures\nThe diagnostic code for major depressive disorder is based on whether this is a single or\nrecurrent episode, current severity, presence of psychotic features, and remission status.\nCurrent severity and psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria are currently met\nfor a major depressive episode. Remission specifiers are only indicated if the full criteria\nare not currently met for a major depressive episode. Codes are as follows: \nIn recording the name of a diagnosis, terms should be listed in the following order: major\ndepressive disorder, single or recurrent episode, severity/psychotic/remission specifiers,\nfollowed by as many of the following specifiers without codes that apply to the current\nepisode.\nSpecify:\nWith anxious distress (p. 184)\nWith mixed features (pp. 184–185)\nWith melancholic features (p. 185)\nWith atypical features (pp. 185–186)\nWith mood-congruent psychotic features (p. 186)\nWith mood-incongruent psychotic features (p. 186)\nWith catatonia (p. 186). Coding note: Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1).\nWith peripartum onset (pp. 186–187)\nWith seasonal pattern (recurrent episode only) (pp. 187–188)\nDiagnostic Features \nThe criterion symptoms for major depressive disorder must be present nearly every day to\nbe considered present, with the exception of weight change and suicidal ideation. De-\npressed mood must be present for most of the day, in addition to being present nearly ev-\nery day. Often insomnia or fatigue is the presenting complaint, and failure to probe for\naccompanying depressive symptoms will result in underdiagnosis. Sadness may be de-\nnied at first but may be elicited through interview or inferred from facial expression and\ndemeanor. With individuals who focus on a somatic complaint, clinicians should de-\ntermine whether the distress from that complaint is associated with specific depressive\nsymptoms. Fatigue and sleep disturbance are present in a high proportion of cases; psy-\nchomotor disturbances are much less common but are indicative of greater overall sever-\nity, as is the presence of delusional or near-delusional guilt.\nSeverity/course specifier\nSingle episode\nRecurrent episode*\nMild (p. 188)\n296.21 (F32.0)\n296.31 (F33.0)\nModerate (p. 188)\n296.22 (F32.1)\n296.32 (F33.1)\nSevere (p. 188)\n296.23 (F32.2)\n296.33 (F33.2)\nWith psychotic features** (p. 186)\n296.24 (F32.3)\n296.34 (F33.3)\nIn partial remission (p. 188)\n296.25 (F32.4)\n296.35 (F33.41)\nIn full remission (p. 188)\n296.26 (F32.5)\n296.36 (F33.42)\nUnspecified\n296.20 (F32.9)\n296.30 (F33.9)\n*For an episode to be considered recurrent, there must be an interval of at least 2 consecutive months\nbetween separate episodes in which criteria are not met for a major depressive episode. The defini-\ntions of specifiers are found on the indicated pages.\n**If psychotic features are present, code the “with psychotic features” specifier irrespective of epi-\nsode severity.\nMajor Depressive Disorder\n163\nThe essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period of at least 2 weeks during\nwhich there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activi-\nties (Criterion A). In children and adolescents, the mood may be irritable rather than sad.\nThe individual must also experience at least four additional symptoms drawn from a list\nthat includes changes in appetite or weight, sleep, and psychomotor activity; decreased en-\nergy; feelings of worthlessness or guilt; difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making deci-\nsions; or recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation or suicide plans or attempts. To\ncount toward a major depressive episode, a symptom must either be newly present or must\nhave clearly worsened compared with the person’s pre-episode status. The symptoms\nmust persist for most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 2 consecutive weeks. The ep-\nisode must be accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-\npational, or other important areas of functioning. For some individuals with milder\nepisodes, functioning may appear to be normal but requires markedly increased effort.\nThe mood in a major depressive episode is often described by the person as depressed,\nsad, hopeless, discouraged, or “down in the dumps” (Criterion A1). In some cases, sadness\nmay be denied at first but may subsequently be elicited by interview (e.g., by pointing out\nthat the individual looks as if he or she is about to cry). In some individuals who complain\nof feeling “blah,” having no feelings, or feeling anxious, the presence of a depressed mood\ncan be inferred from the person’s facial expression and demeanor. Some individuals em-\nphasize somatic complaints (e.g., bodily aches and pains) rather than reporting feelings of\nsadness. Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability (e.g., persistent anger, a\ntendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming others, an exaggerated\nsense of frustration over minor matters). In children and adolescents, an irritable or cranky\nmood may develop rather than a sad or dejected mood. This presentation should be dif-\nferentiated from a pattern of irritability when frustrated.\nLoss of interest or pleasure is nearly always present, at least to some degree. Individ-\nuals may report feeling less interested in hobbies, “not caring anymore,” or not feeling any\nenjoyment in activities that were previously considered pleasurable (Criterion A2). Family\nmembers often notice social withdrawal or neglect of pleasurable avocations (e.g., a for-\nmerly avid golfer no longer plays, a child who used to enjoy soccer finds excuses not to\npractice). In some individuals, there is a significant reduction from previous levels of sex-\nual interest or desire.\nAppetite change may involve either a reduction or increase. Some depressed individ-\nuals report that they have to force themselves to eat. Others may eat more and may crave\nspecific foods (e.g., sweets or other carbohydrates). When appetite changes are severe (in\neither direction), there may be a significant loss or gain in weight, or, in children, a failure\nto make expected weight gains may be noted (Criterion A3).\nSleep disturbance may take the form of either difficulty sleeping or sleeping exces-\nsively (Criterion A4). When insomnia is present, it typically takes the form of middle in-\nsomnia (i.e., waking up during the night and then having difficulty returning to sleep) or\nterminal insomnia (i.e., waking too early and being unable to return to sleep). Initial in-\nsomnia (i.e., difficulty falling asleep) may also occur. Individuals who present with over-\nsleeping (hypersomnia) may experience prolonged sleep episodes at night or increased\ndaytime sleep. Sometimes the reason that the individual seeks treatment is for the dis-\nturbed sleep.\nPsychomotor changes include agitation (e.g., the inability to sit still, pacing, hand-\nwringing; or pulling or rubbing of the skin, clothing, or other objects) or retardation (e.g.,\nslowed speech, thinking, and body movements; increased pauses before answering;\nspeech that is decreased in volume, inflection, amount, or variety of content, or muteness)\n(Criterion A5). The psychomotor agitation or retardation must be severe enough to be ob-\nservable by others and not represent merely subjective feelings.\nDecreased energy, tiredness, and fatigue are common (Criterion A6). A person may re-\nport sustained fatigue without physical exertion. Even the smallest tasks seem to require\n164\nDepressive Disorders\nsubstantial effort. The efficiency with which tasks are accomplished may be reduced. For\nexample, an individual may complain that washing and dressing in the morning are ex-\nhausting and take twice as long as usual.\nThe sense of worthlessness or guilt associated with a major depressive episode may in-\nclude unrealistic negative evaluations of one’s worth or guilty preoccupations or rumina-\ntions over minor past failings (Criterion A7). Such individuals often misinterpret neutral\nor trivial day-to-day events as evidence of personal defects and have an exaggerated sense\nof responsibility for untoward events. The sense of worthlessness or guilt may be of delu-\nsional proportions (e.g., an individual who is convinced that he or she is personally re-\nsponsible for world poverty). Blaming oneself for being sick and for failing to meet\noccupational or interpersonal responsibilities as a result of the depression is very common\nand, unless delusional, is not considered sufficient to meet this criterion.\nMany individuals report impaired ability to think, concentrate, or make even minor\ndecisions (Criterion A8). They may appear easily distracted or complain of memory diffi-\nculties. Those engaged in cognitively demanding pursuits are often unable to function. In\nchildren, a precipitous drop in grades may reflect poor concentration. In elderly individ-\nuals, memory difficulties may be the chief complaint and may be mistaken for early signs\nof a dementia (“pseudodementia”). When the major depressive episode is successfully\ntreated, the memory problems often fully abate. However, in some individuals, particu-\nlarly elderly persons, a major depressive episode may sometimes be the initial presenta-\ntion of an irreversible dementia.\nThoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts (Criterion A9) are common.\nThey may range from a passive wish not to awaken in the morning or a belief that others\nwould be better off if the individual were dead, to transient but recurrent thoughts of com-\nmitting suicide, to a specific suicide plan. More severely suicidal individuals may have put\ntheir affairs in order (e.g., updated wills, settled debts), acquired needed materials (e.g., a\nrope or a gun), and chosen a location and time to accomplish the suicide. Motivations for\nsuicide may include a desire to give up in the face of perceived insurmountable obstacles,\nan intense wish to end what is perceived as an unending and excruciatingly painful emo-\ntional state, an inability to foresee any enjoyment in life, or the wish to not be a burden to\nothers. The resolution of such thinking may be a more meaningful measure of diminished\nsuicide risk than denial of further plans for suicide.\nThe evaluation of the symptoms of a major depressive episode is especially difficult\nwhen they occur in an individual who also has a general medical condition (e.g., cancer,\nstroke, myocardial infarction, diabetes, pregnancy). Some of the criterion signs and symp-\ntoms of a major depressive episode are identical to those of general medical conditions\n(e.g., weight loss with untreated diabetes; fatigue with cancer; hypersomnia early in preg-\nnancy; insomnia later in pregnancy or the postpartum). Such symptoms count toward a\nmajor depressive diagnosis except when they are clearly and fully attributable to a general\nmedical condition. Nonvegetative symptoms of dysphoria, anhedonia, guilt or worthless-\nness, impaired concentration or indecision, and suicidal thoughts should be assessed with\nparticular care in such cases. Definitions of major depressive episodes that have been mod-\nified to include only these nonvegetative symptoms appear to identify nearly the same in-\ndividuals as do the full criteria.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis \nMajor depressive disorder is associated with high mortality, much of which is accounted\nfor by suicide; however, it is not the only cause. For example, depressed individuals ad-\nmitted to nursing homes have a markedly increased likelihood of death in the first year. In-\ndividuals frequently present with tearfulness, irritability, brooding, obsessive rumination,\nanxiety, phobias, excessive worry over physical health, and complaints of pain (e.g., head-\naches; joint, abdominal, or other pains). In children, separation anxiety may occur. \nMajor Depressive Disorder\n165\nAlthough an extensive literature exists describing neuroanatomical, neuroendocrino-\nlogical, and neurophysiological correlates of major depressive disorder, no laboratory test\nhas yielded results of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as a diagnostic tool for\nthis disorder. Until recently, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity had been\nthe most extensively investigated abnormality associated with major depressive episodes,\nand it appears to be associated with melancholia, psychotic features, and risks for eventual\nsuicide. Molecular studies have also implicated peripheral factors, including genetic vari-\nants in neurotrophic factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging studies provide evidence for functional abnormalities in spe-\ncific neural systems supporting emotion processing, reward seeking, and emotion regula-\ntion in adults with major depression. \nPrevalence\nTwelve-month prevalence of major depressive disorder in the United States is approximately\n7%, with marked differences by age group such that the prevalence in 18- to 29-year-old indi-\nviduals is threefold higher than the prevalence in individuals age 60 years or older. Females ex-\nperience 1.5- to 3-fold higher rates than males beginning in early adolescence.\nDevelopment and Course\nMajor depressive disorder may first appear at any age, but the likelihood of onset in-\ncreases markedly with puberty. In the United States, incidence appears to peak in the 20s;\nhowever, first onset in late life is not uncommon. \nThe course of major depressive disorder is quite variable, such that some individuals\nrarely, if ever, experience remission (a period of 2 or more months with no symptoms, or\nonly one or two symptoms to no more than a mild degree), while others experience many\nyears with few or no symptoms between discrete episodes. It is important to distinguish\nindividuals who present for treatment during an exacerbation of a chronic depressive ill-\nness from those whose symptoms developed recently. Chronicity of depressive symptoms\nsubstantially increases the likelihood of underlying personality, anxiety, and substance\nuse disorders and decreases the likelihood that treatment will be followed by full symp-\ntom resolution. It is therefore useful to ask individuals presenting with depressive symp-\ntoms to identify the last period of at least 2 months during which they were entirely free of\ndepressive symptoms. \nRecovery typically begins within 3 months of onset for two in five individuals with ma-\njor depression and within 1 year for four in five individuals. Recency of onset is a strong\ndeterminant of the likelihood of near-term recovery, and many individuals who have been\ndepressed only for several months can be expected to recover spontaneously. Features as-\nsociated with lower recovery rates, other than current episode duration, include psychotic\nfeatures, prominent anxiety, personality disorders, and symptom severity.\nThe risk of recurrence becomes progessively lower over time as the duration of re-\nmission increases. The risk is higher in individuals whose preceding episode was severe,\nin younger individuals, and in individuals who have already experienced multiple epi-\nsodes. The persistence of even mild depressive symptoms during remission is a powerful\npredictor of recurrence.\nMany bipolar illnesses begin with one or more depressive episodes, and a substantial\nproportion of individuals who initially appear to have major depressive disorder will\nprove, in time, to instead have a bipolar disorder. This is more likely in individuals with\nonset of the illness in adolescence, those with psychotic features, and those with a family\nhistory of bipolar illness. The presence of a “with mixed features” specifier also increases\nthe risk for future manic or hypomanic diagnosis. Major depressive disorder, particularly\nwith psychotic features, may also transition into schizophrenia, a change that is much\nmore frequent than the reverse. \n166\nDepressive Disorders\nDespite consistent differences between genders in prevalence rates for depressive disor-\nders, there appear to be no clear differences by gender in phenomenology, course, or treat-\nment response. Similarly, there are no clear effects of current age on the course or treatment\nresponse of major depressive disorder. Some symptom differences exist, though, such that\nhypersomnia and hyperphagia are more likely in younger individuals, and melancholic\nsymptoms, particularly psychomotor disturbances, are more common in older individuals.\nThe likelihood of suicide attempts lessens in middle and late life, although the risk of com-\npleted suicide does not. Depressions with earlier ages at onset are more familial and more\nlikely to involve personality disturbances. The course of major depressive disorder within\nindividuals does not generally change with aging. Mean times to recovery appear to be sta-\nble over long periods, and the likelihood of being in an episode does not generally increase\nor decrease with time. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nTemperamental.\nNeuroticism (negative affectivity) is a well-established risk factor for the\nonset of major depressive disorder, and high levels appear to render individuals more likely\nto develop depressive episodes in response to stressful life events.\nEnvironmental.\nAdverse childhood experiences, particularly when there are multiple\nexperiences of diverse types, constitute a set of potent risk factors for major depressive dis-\norder. Stressful life events are well recognized as precipitants of major depressive epi-\nsodes, but the presence or absence of adverse life events near the onset of episodes does\nnot appear to provide a useful guide to prognosis or treatment selection.\nGenetic and physiological.\nFirst-degree family members of individuals with major de-\npressive disorder have a risk for major depressive disorder two- to fourfold higher than\nthat of the general population. Relative risks appear to be higher for early-onset and re-\ncurrent forms. Heritability is approximately 40%, and the personality trait neuroticism ac-\ncounts for a substantial portion of this genetic liability.\nCourse modifiers.\nEssentially all major nonmood disorders increase the risk of an indi-\nvidual developing depression. Major depressive episodes that develop against the back-\nground of another disorder often follow a more refractory course. Substance use, anxiety,\nand borderline personality disorders are among the most common of these, and the pre-\nsenting depressive symptoms may obscure and delay their recognition. However, sus-\ntained clinical improvement in depressive symptoms may depend on the appropriate\ntreatment of underlying illnesses. Chronic or disabling medical conditions also increase\nrisks for major depressive episodes. Such prevalent illnesses as diabetes, morbid obesity,\nand cardiovascular disease are often complicated by depressive episodes, and these epi-\nsodes are more likely to become chronic than are depressive episodes in medically healthy\nindividuals.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nSurveys of major depressive disorder across diverse cultures have shown sevenfold dif-\nferences in 12-month prevalence rates but much more consistency in female-to-male ratio,\nmean ages at onset, and the degree to which presence of the disorder raises the likelihood\nof comorbid substance abuse. While these findings suggest substantial cultural differences\nin the expression of major depressive disorder, they do not permit simple linkages be-\ntween particular cultures and the likelihood of specific symptoms. Rather, clinicians\nshould be aware that in most countries the majority of cases of depression go unrecog-\nnized in primary care settings and that in many cultures, somatic symptoms are very likely\nto constitute the presenting complaint. Among the Criterion A symptoms, insomnia and\nloss of energy are the most uniformly reported.\nMajor Depressive Disorder\n167\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nAlthough the most reproducible finding in the epidemiology of major depressive disorder\nhas been a higher prevalence in females, there are no clear differences between genders in\nsymptoms, course, treatment response, or functional consequences. In women, the risk for\nsuicide attempts is higher, and the risk for suicide completion is lower. The disparity in\nsuicide rate by gender is not as great among those with depressive disorders as it is in the\npopulation as a whole. \nSuicide Risk\nThe possibility of suicidal behavior exists at all times during major depressive episodes.\nThe most consistently described risk factor is a past history of suicide attempts or threats,\nbut it should be remembered that most completed suicides are not preceded by unsuccess-\nful attempts. Other features associated with an increased risk for completed suicide\ninclude male sex, being single or living alone, and having prominent feelings of hopeless-\nness. The presence of borderline personality disorder markedly increases risk for future\nsuicide attempts. \nFunctional Consequences of \nMajor Depressive Disorder\nMany of the functional consequences of major depressive disorder derive from individual\nsymptoms. Impairment can be very mild, such that many of those who interact with the af-\nfected individual are unaware of depressive symptoms. Impairment may, however, range\nto complete incapacity such that the depressed individual is unable to attend to basic self-\ncare needs or is mute or catatonic. Among individuals seen in general medical settings,\nthose with major depressive disorder have more pain and physical illness and greater de-\ncreases in physical, social, and role functioning.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nManic episodes with irritable mood or mixed episodes.\nMajor depressive episodes\nwith prominent irritable mood may be difficult to distinguish from manic episodes with\nirritable mood or from mixed episodes. This distinction requires a careful clinical evalua-\ntion of the presence of manic symptoms.\nMood disorder due to another medical condition.\nA major depressive episode is the\nappropriate diagnosis if the mood disturbance is not judged, based on individual history,\nphysical examination, and laboratory findings, to be the direct pathophysiological conse-\nquence of a specific medical condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis, stroke, hypothyroidism).\nSubstance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar disorder.\nThis disorder is distin-\nguished from major depressive disorder by the fact that a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse,\na medication, a toxin) appears to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance. For ex-\nample, depressed mood that occurs only in the context of withdrawal from cocaine would\nbe diagnosed as cocaine-induced depressive disorder. \nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nDistractibility and low frustration tolerance\ncan occur in both attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder and a major depressive epi-\nsode; if the criteria are met for both, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may be diag-\nnosed in addition to the mood disorder. However, the clinician must be cautious not to\noverdiagnose a major depressive episode in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity\ndisorder whose disturbance in mood is characterized by irritability rather than by sadness\nor loss of interest.\n168\nDepressive Disorders\nAdjustment disorder with depressed mood.\nA major depressive episode that occurs in\nresponse to a psychosocial stressor is distinguished from adjustment disorder with de-\npressed mood by the fact that the full criteria for a major depressive episode are not met in\nadjustment disorder.\nSadness.\nFinally, periods of sadness are inherent aspects of the human experience.\nThese periods should not be diagnosed as a major depressive episode unless criteria are\nmet for severity (i.e., five out of nine symptoms), duration (i.e., most of the day, nearly ev-\nery day for at least 2 weeks), and clinically significant distress or impairment. The diagno-\nsis other specified depressive disorder may be appropriate for presentations of depressed\nmood with clinically significant impairment that do not meet criteria for duration or se-\nverity.\nComorbidity\nOther disorders with which major depressive disorder frequently co-occurs are substance-\nrelated disorders, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, buli-\nmia nervosa, and borderline personality disorder.", "provenance": {"source_file": "depressive_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 2, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.442385"}}

This disorder represents a consolidation of\nDSM-IV-defined chronic major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder. Major de-\npression may precede persistent depressive disorder, and major depressive episodes may\noccur during persistent depressive disorder. Individuals whose symptoms meet major de-\npressive disorder criteria for 2 years should be given a diagnosis of persistent depressive\ndisorder as well as major depressive disorder.\nIndividuals with persistent depressive disorder describe their mood as sad or “down\nin the dumps.” During periods of depressed mood, at least two of the six symptoms from\nCriterion B are present. Because these symptoms have become a part of the individual’s\nday-to-day experience, particularly in the case of early onset (e.g., “I’ve always been this\n170\nDepressive Disorders\nway”), they may not be reported unless the individual is directly prompted. During the 2-year\nperiod (1 year for children or adolescents), any symptom-free intervals last no longer than\n2 months (Criterion C). \nPrevalence\nPersistent depressive disorder is effectively an amalgam of DSM-IV dysthymic disorder and\nchronic major depressive episode. The 12-month prevalence in the United States is approxi-\nmately 0.5% for persistent depressive disorder and 1.5% for chronic major depressive disorder.\nDevelopment and Course\nPersistent depressive disorder often has an early and insidious onset (i.e., in childhood,\nadolescence, or early adult life) and, by definition, a chronic course. Among individuals\nwith both persistent depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder, the covari-\nance of the corresponding features over time suggests the operation of a common mecha-\nnism. Early onset (i.e., before age 21 years) is associated with a higher likelihood of\ncomorbid personality disorders and substance use disorders.\nWhen symptoms rise to the level of a major depressive episode, they are likely to sub-\nsequently revert to a lower level. However, depressive symptoms are much less likely to\nresolve in a given period of time in the context of persistent depressive disorder than they\nare in a major depressive episode.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nTemperamental.\nFactors predictive of poorer long-term outcome include higher levels\nof neuroticism (negative affectivity), greater symptom severity, poorer global functioning,\nand presence of anxiety disorders or conduct disorder.\nEnvironmental.\nChildhood risk factors include parental loss or separation.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThere are no clear differences in illness development, course,\nor family history between DSM-IV dysthymic disorder and chronic major depressive dis-\norder. Earlier findings pertaining to either disorder are therefore likely to apply to per-\nsistent depressive disorder. It is thus likely that individuals with persistent depressive\ndisorder will have a higher proportion of first-degree relatives with persistent depressive\ndisorder than do individuals with major depressive disorder, and more depressive disor-\nders in general.\nA number of brain regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, amygdala, hip-\npocampus) have been implicated in persistent depressive disorder. Possible polysomno-\ngraphic abnormalities exist as well.\nFunctional Consequences of \nPersistent Depressive Disorder\nThe degree to which persistent depressive disorder impacts social and occupational func-\ntioning is likely to vary widely, but effects can be as great as or greater than those of major\ndepressive disorder.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nMajor depressive disorder.\nIf there is a depressed mood plus two or more symptoms\nmeeting criteria for a persistent depressive episode for 2 years or more, then the diagnosis of\npersistent depressive disorder is made. The diagnosis depends on the 2-year duration,\nwhich distinguishes it from episodes of depression that do not last 2 years. If the symptom\nPremenstrual Dysphoric Disorder\n171\ncriteria are sufficient for a diagnosis of a major depressive episode at any time during this pe-\nriod, then the diagnosis of major depression should be noted, but it is coded not as a separate\ndiagnosis but rather as a specifier with the diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder. If the\nindividual’s symptoms currently meet full criteria for a major depressive episode, then the\nspecifier of “with intermittent major depressive episodes, with current episode” would be\nmade. If the major depressive episode has persisted for at least a 2-year duration and re-\nmains present, then the specifier “with persistent major depressive episode” is used. When\nfull major depressive episode criteria are not currently met but there has been at least one\nprevious episode of major depression in the context of at least 2 years of persistent depres-\nsive symptoms, then the specifier of “with intermittent major depressive episodes, without\ncurrent episode” is used. If the individual has not experienced an episode of major depres-\nsion in the last 2 years, then the specifier “with pure dysthymic syndrome” is used.\nPsychotic disorders.\nDepressive symptoms are a common associated feature of chronic\npsychotic disorders (e.g., schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, delusional disorder). A\nseparate diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder is not made if the symptoms occur\nonly during the course of the psychotic disorder (including residual phases).\nDepressive or bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition.\nPersistent\ndepressive disorder must be distinguished from a depressive or bipolar and related dis-\norder due to another medical condition. The diagnosis is depressive or bipolar and related\ndisorder due to another medical condition if the mood disturbance is judged, based on his-\ntory, physical examination, or laboratory findings, to be attributable to the direct patho-\nphysiological effects of a specific, usually chronic, medical condition (e.g., multiple\nsclerosis). If it is judged that the depressive symptoms are not attributable to the physiolog-\nical effects of another medical condition, then the primary mental disorder (e.g., persistent\ndepressive disorder) is recorded, and the medical condition is noted as a concomitant med-\nical condition (e.g., diabetes mellitus).\nSubstance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar disorder.\nA substance/medi-\ncation-induced depressive or bipolar and related disorder is distinguished from persis-\ntent depressive disorder when a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, a toxin) is\njudged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance.\nPersonality disorders.\nOften, there is evidence of a coexisting personality disturbance.\nWhen an individual’s presentation meets the criteria for both persistent depressive disor-\nder and a personality disorder, both diagnoses are given.\nComorbidity \nIn comparison to individuals with major depressive disorder, those with persistent de-\npressive disorder are at higher risk for psychiatric comorbidity in general, and for anxiety\ndisorders and substance use disorders in particular. Early-onset persistent depressive dis-\norder is strongly associated with DSM-IV Cluster B and C personality disorders.", "provenance": {"source_file": "depressive_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 3, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.442385"}}

In the majority of menstrual cycles, at least five symptoms must be present in the final\nweek before the onset of menses, start to improve within a few days after the onset of\nmenses, and become minimal or absent in the week postmenses.\nB.

Marked affective lability (e.g., mood swings; feeling suddenly sad or tearful, or in-\ncreased sensitivity to rejection).\n172\nDepressive Disorders\n2.

Marked change in appetite; overeating; or specific food cravings.\n5. Hypersomnia or insomnia.\n6. A sense of being overwhelmed or out of control.\n7.

The symptoms are associated with clinically significant distress or interference with\nwork, school, usual social activities, or relationships with others (e.g., avoidance of so-\ncial activities; decreased productivity and efficiency at work, school, or home).\nE. The disturbance is not merely an exacerbation of the symptoms of another disorder,\nsuch as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, persistent depressive disorder\n(dysthymia), or a personality disorder (although it may co-occur with any of these dis-\norders).\nF. Criterion A should be confirmed by prospective daily ratings during at least two symptom-\natic cycles. (Note: The diagnosis may be made provisionally prior to this confirmation.)\nG. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a\ndrug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or another medical condition (e.g., hy-\nperthyroidism).\nRecording Procedures\nIf symptoms have not been confirmed by prospective daily ratings of at least two symp-\ntomatic cycles, “provisional” should be noted after the name of the diagnosis (i.e., “pre-\nmenstrual dysphoric disorder, provisional”).\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential features of premenstrual dysphoric disorder are the expression of mood la-\nbility, irritability, dysphoria, and anxiety symptoms that occur repeatedly during the pre-\nmenstrual phase of the cycle and remit around the onset of menses or shortly thereafter.\nThese symptoms may be accompanied by behavioral and physical symptoms. Symptoms\nmust have occurred in most of the menstrual cycles during the past year and must have an\nadverse effect on work or social functioning. The intensity and/or expressivity of the ac-\ncompanying symptoms may be closely related to social and cultural background charac-\nteristics of the affected female, family perspectives, and more specific factors such as\nreligious beliefs, social tolerance, and female gender role issues.\nTypically, symptoms peak around the time of the onset of menses. Although it is not\nuncommon for symptoms to linger into the first few days of menses, the individual must\nhave a symptom-free period in the follicular phase after the menstrual period begins.\nWhile the core symptoms include mood and anxiety symptoms, behavioral and somatic\nsymptoms commonly also occur. However, the presence of physical and/or behavioral\nsymptoms in the absence of mood and/or anxious symptoms is not sufficient for a diag-\nPremenstrual Dysphoric Disorder\n173\nnosis. Symptoms are of comparable severity (but not duration) to those of another mental\ndisorder, such as a major depressive episode or generalized anxiety disorder. In order to\nconfirm a provisional diagnosis, daily prospective symptom ratings are required for at\nleast two symptomatic cycles.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nDelusions and hallucinations have been described in the late luteal phase of the menstrual\ncycle but are rare. The premenstrual phase has been considered by some to be a risk period\nfor suicide. \nPrevalence\nTwelve-month prevalence of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is between 1.8% and 5.8%\nof menstruating women. Estimates are substantially inflated if they are based on retro-\nspective reports rather than prospective daily ratings. However, estimated prevalence\nbased on a daily record of symptoms for 1–2 months may be less representative, as indi-\nviduals with the most severe symptoms may be unable to sustain the rating process. The\nmost rigorous estimate of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is 1.8% for women whose\nsymptoms meet the full criteria without functional impairment and 1.3% for women\nwhose symptoms meet the current criteria with functional impairment and without co-oc-\ncurring symptoms from another mental disorder. \nDevelopment and Course\nOnset of premenstrual dysphoric disorder can occur at any point after menarche. Inci-\ndence of new cases over a 40-month follow-up period is 2.5% (95% confidence interval =\n1.7–3.7). Anecdotally, many individuals, as they approach menopause, report that symp-\ntoms worsen. Symptoms cease after menopause, although cyclical hormone replacement\ncan trigger the re-expression of symptoms.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nEnvironmental.\nEnvironmental factors associated with the expression of premenstrual\ndysphoric disorder include stress, history of interpersonal trauma, seasonal changes, and\nsociocultural aspects of female sexual behavior in general, and female gender role in par-\nticular. \nGenetic and physiological.\nHeritability of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is unknown.\nHowever, for premenstrual symptoms, estimates for heritability range between 30% and\n80%, with the most stable component of premenstrual symptoms estimated to be about\n50% heritable. \nCourse modifiers.\nWomen who use oral contraceptives may have fewer premenstrual\ncomplaints than do women who do not use oral contraceptives. \nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nPremenstrual dysphoric disorder is not a culture-bound syndrome and has been observed\nin individuals in the United States, Europe, India, and Asia. It is unclear as to whether rates\ndiffer by race. Nevertheless, frequency, intensity, and expressivity of symptoms and help-\nseeking patterns may be significantly influenced by cultural factors. \nDiagnostic Markers\nAs indicated earlier, the diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is appropriately\nconfirmed by 2 months of prospective symptom ratings. A number of scales, including the\n174\nDepressive Disorders\nDaily Rating of Severity of Problems and the Visual Analogue Scales for Premenstrual\nMood Symptoms, have undergone validation and are commonly used in clinical trials for\npremenstrual dysphoric disorder. The Premenstrual Tension Syndrome Rating Scale has a\nself-report and an observer version, both of which have been validated and used widely to\nmeasure illness severity in women who have premenstrual dysphoric disorder.\nFunctional Consequences of \nPremenstrual Dysphoric Disorder\nSymptoms must be associated with clinically meaningful distress and/or an obvious and\nmarked impairment in the ability to function socially or occupationally in the week prior\nto menses. Impairment in social functioning may be manifested by marital discord and\nproblems with children, other family members, or friends. Chronic marital or job prob-\nlems should not be confused with dysfunction that occurs only in association with pre-\nmenstrual dysphoric disorder. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nPremenstrual syndrome.\nPremenstrual syndrome differs from premenstrual dysphoric\ndisorder in that a minimum of five symptoms is not required, and there is no stipulation of\naffective symptoms for individuals who have premenstrual syndrome. This condition\nmay be more common than premenstrual dysphoric disorder, although the estimated\nprevalence of premenstrual syndrome varies. While premenstrual syndrome shares the\nfeature of symptom expression during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle, it is\ngenerally considered to be less severe than premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The pres-\nence of physical or behavioral symptoms in the premenstruum, without the required\naffective symptoms, likely meets criteria for premenstrual syndrome and not for premen-\nstrual dysphoric disorder.\nDysmenorrhea.\nDysmenorrhea is a syndrome of painful menses, but this is distinct from a\nsyndrome characterized by affective changes. Moreover, symptoms of dysmenorrhea begin\nwith the onset of menses, whereas symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, by defini-\ntion, begin before the onset of menses, even if they linger into the first few days of menses. \nBipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and persistent depressive disorder\n(dysthymia).\nMany women with (either naturally occurring or substance/medication-\ninduced) bipolar or major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder believe\nthat they have premenstrual dysphoric disorder. However, when they chart symptoms,\nthey realize that the symptoms do not follow a premenstrual pattern. Women with an-\nother mental disorder may experience chronic symptoms or intermittent symptoms that\nare unrelated to menstrual cycle phase. However, because the onset of menses constitutes\na memorable event, they may report that symptoms occur only during the premenstruum\nor that symptoms worsen premenstrually. This is one of the rationales for the requirement\nthat symptoms be confirmed by daily prospective ratings. The process of differential di-\nagnosis, particularly if the clinician relies on retrospective symptoms only, is made more\ndifficult because of the overlap between symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder\nand some other diagnoses. The overlap of symptoms is particularly salient for differenti-\nating premenstrual dysphoric disorder from major depressive episodes, persistent de-\npressive disorder, bipolar disorders, and borderline personality disorder. However, the\nrate of personality disorders is no higher in individuals with premenstrual dysphoric dis-\norder than in those without the disorder.\nUse of hormonal treatments.\nSome women who present with moderate to severe pre-\nmenstrual symptoms may be using hormonal treatments, including hormonal contracep-\ntives. If such symptoms occur after initiation of exogenous hormone use, the symptoms\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder\n175\nmay be due to the use of hormones rather than to the underlying condition of premen-\nstrual dysphoric disorder. If the woman stops hormones and the symptoms disappear,\nthis is consistent with substance/medication-induced depressive disorder.\nComorbidity\nA major depressive episode is the most frequently reported previous disorder in individuals\npresenting with premenstrual dysphoric disorder. A wide range of medical (e.g., migraine,\nasthma, allergies, seizure disorders) or other mental disorders (e.g., depressive and bipolar\ndisorders, anxiety disorders, bulimia nervosa, substance use disorders) may worsen in the\npremenstrual phase; however, the absence of a symptom-free period during the postmen-\nstrual interval obviates a diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. These conditions\nare better considered premenstrual exacerbation of a current mental or medical disorder. Al-\nthough the diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder should not be assigned in situa-\ntions in which an individual only experiences a premenstrual exacerbation of another\nmental or physical disorder, it can be considered in addition to the diagnosis of another men-\ntal or physical disorder if the individual experiences symptoms and changes in level of func-\ntioning that are characteristic of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and markedly different\nfrom the symptoms experienced as part of the ongoing disorder.", "provenance": {"source_file": "depressive_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 4, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.443383"}}

A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predominates in the clinical pic-\nture and is characterized by depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or plea-\nsure in all, or almost all, activities.\nB. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both\n(1) and (2):\n1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication\nor withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.\n2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Crite-\nrion A.\nC. The disturbance is not better explained by a depressive disorder that is not substance/\nmedication-induced. Such evidence of an independent depressive disorder could in-\nclude the following:\nThe symptoms preceded the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms\npersist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute\nwithdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the existence\nof an independent non-substance/medication-induced depressive disorder (e.g., a his-\ntory of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes).\nD. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. \nE. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning.\nNote: This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or\nsubstance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical\npicture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.\nCoding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medica-\ntion]-induced depressive disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-\n176\nDepressive Disorders\nCM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for\nthe same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-\ninduced depressive disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record\n“mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced depressive disorder (e.g.,\n“mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced depressive disorder”). If a moderate or se-\nvere substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced depressive disorder,\nthe 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use\ndisorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid\nsubstance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-\ntime heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should\nrecord only the substance-induced depressive disorder.\nSpecify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders” for di-\nagnoses associated with substance class):\nWith onset during intoxication: If criteria are met for intoxication with the substance\nand the symptoms develop during intoxication.\nWith onset during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance\nand the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.\nRecording Procedures\nICD-9-CM.\nThe name of the substance/medication-induced depressive disorder begins\nwith the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing\nthe depressive symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the\ncriteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the\nclasses (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases\nin which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance\nis unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used.\nThe name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during in-\ntoxication, onset during withdrawal). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM,\nwhich combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single\nICD-10-CM\nICD-9-CM\nWith use \ndisorder, \nmild\nWith use \ndisorder, \nmoderate \nor severe\nWithout \nuse \ndisorder\nAlcohol\n291.89\nF10.14\nF10.24\nF10.94\nPhencyclidine\n292.84\nF16.14\nF16.24\nF16.94\nOther hallucinogen\n292.84\nF16.14\nF16.24\nF16.94\nInhalant\n292.84\nF18.14\nF18.24\nF18.94\nOpioid\n292.84\nF11.14\nF11.24\nF11.94\nSedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic\n292.84\nF13.14\nF13.24\nF13.94\nAmphetamine (or other \nstimulant)\n292.84\nF15.14\nF15.24\nF15.94\nCocaine\n292.84\nF14.14\nF14.24\nF14.94\nOther (or unknown) substance\n292.84\nF19.14\nF19.24\nF19.94\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder\n177\ncode, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For\nexample, in the case of depressive symptoms occurring during withdrawal in a man with\na severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.84 cocaine-induced depressive disorder,\nwith onset during withdrawal. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use dis-\norder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in\nthe development of depressive mood symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g.,\n292.84 methylphenidate-induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal;\n292.84 dexamethasone-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication).\nICD-10-CM.\nThe name of the substance/medication-induced depressive disorder begins\nwith the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing\nthe depressive symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the\ncriteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid sub-\nstance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexameth-\nasone), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is\njudged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category\n“unknown substance” should be used.\nWhen recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is\nlisted first, followed by the word “with,” followed by the name of the substance-induced de-\npressive disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset\nduring withdrawal). For example, in the case of depressive symptoms occurring during with-\ndrawal in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14.24 severe cocaine use\ndisorder with cocaine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal. A separate\ndiagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced\ndepressive disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time\nheavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F16.94\nphencyclidine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication). When more than\none substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of depressive mood\nsymptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., F15.24 severe methylphenidate use disorder\nwith methylphenidate-induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal; F19.94\ndexamethasone-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication).\nDiagnostic Features\nThe diagnostic features of substance/medication-induced depressive disorder include the\nsymptoms of a depressive disorder, such as major depressive disorder; however, the de-\npressive symptoms are associated with the ingestion, injection, or inhalation of a sub-\nstance (e.g., drug of abuse, toxin, psychotropic medication, other medication), and the\ndepressive symptoms persist beyond the expected length of physiological effects, intoxi-\ncation, or withdrawal period. As evidenced by clinical history, physical examination, or\nlaboratory findings, the relevant depressive disorder should have developed during or\nwithin 1 month after use of a substance that is capable of producing the depressive disor-\nder (Criterion B1). In addition, the diagnosis is not better explained by an independent\ndepressive disorder. Evidence of an independent depressive disorder includes the de-\npressive disorder preceded the onset of ingestion or withdrawal from the substance; the\ndepressive disorder persists beyond a substantial period of time after the cessation of sub-\nstance use; or other evidence suggests the existence of an independent non-substance/\nmedication-induced depressive disorder (Criterion C). This diagnosis should not be made\nwhen symptoms occur exclusively during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The de-\npressive disorder associated with the substance use, intoxication, or withdrawal must\ncause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other impor-\ntant areas of functioning to qualify for this diagnosis (Criterion E).\nSome medications (e.g., stimulants, steroids, L-dopa, antibiotics, central nervous\nsystem drugs, dermatological agents, chemotherapeutic drugs, immunological agents)\n178\nDepressive Disorders\ncan induce depressive mood disturbances. Clinical judgment is essential to determine\nwhether the medication is truly associated with inducing the depressive disorder or\nwhether a primary depressive disorder happened to have its onset while the person was\nreceiving the treatment. For example, a depressive episode that developed within the first\nseveral weeks of beginning alpha-methyldopa (an antihypertensive agent) in an individ-\nual with no history of major depressive disorder would qualify for the diagnosis of med-\nication-induced depressive disorder. In some cases, a previously established condition\n(e.g., major depressive disorder, recurrent) can recur while the individual is coincidentally\ntaking a medication that has the capacity to cause depressive symptoms (e.g., L-dopa, oral\ncontraceptives). In such cases, the clinician must make a judgment as to whether the med-\nication is causative in this particular situation.\nA substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is distinguished from a primary\ndepressive disorder by considering the onset, course, and other factors associated with the\nsubstance use. There must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or labora-\ntory findings of substance use, abuse, intoxication, or withdrawal prior to the onset of the\ndepressive disorder. The withdrawal state for some substances can be relatively pro-\ntracted, and thus intense depressive symptoms can last for a long period after the cessation\nof substance use. \nPrevalence\nIn a nationally representative U.S. adult population, the lifetime prevalence of substance/\nmedication-induced depressive disorder is 0.26%.\nDevelopment and Course\nA depressive disorder associated with the use of substance (i.e., alcohol, illicit drugs, or a\nprescribed treatment for a mental disorder or another medical condition) must have its on-\nset while the individual is using the substance or during withdrawal, if there is a with-\ndrawal syndrome associated with the substance. Most often, the depressive disorder has\nits onset within the first few weeks or 1 month of use of the substance. Once the substance\nis discontinued, the depressive symptoms usually remit within days to several weeks, de-\npending on the half-life of the substance/medication and the presence of a withdrawal\nsyndrome. If symptoms persist 4 weeks beyond the expected time course of withdrawal of\na particular substance/medication, other causes for the depressive mood symptoms\nshould be considered.\nAlthough there are a few prospective controlled trials examining the association of de-\npressive symptoms with use of a medication, most reports are from postmarketing sur-\nveillance studies, retrospective observational studies, or case reports, making evidence of\ncausality difficult to determine. Substances implicated in medication-induced depressive\ndisorder, with varying degrees of evidence, include antiviral agents (efavirenz), cardio-\nvascular agents (clonidine, guanethidine, methyldopa, reserpine), retinoic acid deriva-\ntives (isotretinoin), antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anti-migraine agents (triptans),\nantipsychotics, hormonal agents (corticosteroids, oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-\nreleasing hormone agonists, tamoxifen), smoking cessation agents (varenicline), and im-\nmunological agents (interferon). However, other potential substances continue to emerge\nas new compounds are synthesized. A history of such substance use may help increase di-\nagnostic certainty.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nTemperamental.\nFactors that appear to increase the risk of substance/medication-\ninduced depressive disorder can be conceptualized as pertaining to the specific type of\ndrug or to a group of individuals with underlying alcohol or drug use disorders. Risk fac-\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder\n179\ntors common to all drugs include history of major depressive disorder, history of drug-\ninduced depression, and psychosocial stressors.\nEnvironmental.\n There are also risks factors pertaining to a specific type of medication\n(e.g., increased immune activation prior to treatment for hepatitis C associated with inter-\nferon-alfa-induced depression); high doses (greater than 80 mg/day prednisone-equiva-\nlents) of corticosteroids or high plasma concentrations of efavirenz; and high estrogen/\nprogesterone content in oral contraceptives.\nCourse modifiers.\nIn a representative U.S. adult population, compared with individuals\nwith major depressive disorder who did not have a substance use disorder, individuals\nwith substance-induced depressive disorder were more likely to be male, to be black, to\nhave at most a high school diploma, to lack insurance, and to have lower family income.\nThey were also more likely to report higher family history of substance use disorders and\nantisocial behavior, higher 12-month history of stressful life events, and a greater number\nof DSM-IV major depressive disorder criteria. They were more likely to report feelings of\nworthlessness, insomnia/hypersomnia, and thoughts of death and suicide attempts, but\nless likely to report depressed mood and parental loss by death before age 18 years.\nDiagnostic Markers\nDetermination of the substance of use can sometimes be made through laboratory assays\nof the suspected substance in the blood or urine to corroborate the diagnosis.\nSuicide Risk\nDrug-induced or treatment-emergent suicidality represents a marked change in thoughts\nand behavior from the person’s baseline, is usually temporally associated with initiation of\na substance, and must be distinguished from the underlying primary mental disorders.\nIn regard to the treatment-emergent suicidality associated with antidepressants, a U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee considered meta-analyses of\n99,839 participants enrolled in 372 randomized clinical trials of antidepressants in trials for\nmental disorders. The analyses showed that when the data were pooled across all adult\nage groups, there was no perceptible increased risk of suicidal behavior or ideation. How-\never, in age-stratified analyses, the risk for patients ages 18–24 years was elevated, albeit\nnot significantly (odds ratio [OR] = 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.91–2.70). The\nFDA meta-analyses reveal an absolute risk of suicide in patients taking investigational an-\ntidepressants of 0.01%. In conclusion, suicide is clearly an extremely rare treatment-emer-\ngent phenomenon, but the outcome of suicide was serious enough to prompt the FDA to\nissue an expanded black-box warning in 2007 regarding the importance of careful moni-\ntoring of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation in patients receiving antidepressants.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nSubstance intoxication and withdrawal.\nDepressive symptoms occur commonly in sub-\nstance intoxication and substance withdrawal, and the diagnosis of the substance-specific\nintoxication or withdrawal will usually suffice to categorize the symptom presentation. A\ndiagnosis of substance-induced depressive disorder should be made instead of a diag-\nnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal when the mood symptoms are\nsufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention. For example, dysphoric\nmood is a characteristic feature of cocaine withdrawal. Substance/medication-induced\ndepressive disorder should be diagnosed instead of cocaine withdrawal only if the mood\ndisturbance is substantially more intense or longer lasting than what is usually encountered\nwith cocaine withdrawal and is sufficiently severe to be a separate focus of attention and\ntreatment.\n180\nDepressive Disorders\nPrimary depressive disorder.\nA substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is\ndistinguished from a primary depressive disorder by the fact that a substance is judged to\nbe etiologically related to the symptoms, as described earlier (see section “Development\nand Course” for this disorder).\nDepressive disorder due to another medical condition.\nBecause individuals with other\nmedical conditions often take medications for those conditions, the clinician must consider the\npossibility that the mood symptoms are caused by the physiological consequences of the med-\nical condition rather than the medication, in which case depressive disorder due to another\nmedical condition is diagnosed. The history often provides the primary basis for such a judg-\nment. At times, a change in the treatment for the other medical condition (e.g., medication sub-\nstitution or discontinuation) may be needed to determine empirically whether the medication\nis the causative agent. If the clinician has ascertained that the disturbance is a function of both\nanother medical condition and substance use or withdrawal, both diagnoses (i.e., depressive\ndisorder due to another medical condition and substance/medication-induced depressive\ndisorder) may be given. When there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the depres-\nsive symptoms are associated with substance (including a medication) ingestion or with-\ndrawal or with another medical condition or are primary (i.e., not a function of either a\nsubstance or another medical condition), a diagnosis of other specified depressive disorder or\nunspecified depressive disorder would be indicated.\nComorbidity\nCompared with individuals with major depressive disorder and no comorbid substance\nuse disorder, those with substance/medication-induced depressive disorder have higher\nrates of comorbidity with any DSM-IV mental disorder; are more likely to have specific\nDSM-IV disorders of pathological gambling and paranoid, histrionic, and antisocial per-\nsonality disorders; and are less likely to have persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia).\nCompared with individuals with major depressive disorder and a comorbid substance use\ndisorder, individuals with substance/medication-induced depressive disorder are more\nlikely to have alcohol use disorder, any other substance use disorder, and histrionic per-\nsonality disorder; however, they are less likely to have persistent depressive disorder.", "provenance": {"source_file": "depressive_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 5, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.443383"}}

The other medical condition should also be coded and listed separately immediately\nbefore the depressive disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., 244.9 [E03.9] hypothyroid-\nism; 293.83 [F06.31] depressive disorder due to hypothyroidism, with depressive features).\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of depressive disorder due to another medical condition is a promi-\nnent and persistent period of depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or plea-\nsure in all, or almost all, activities that predominates in the clinical picture (Criterion A)\nand that is thought to be related to the direct physiological effects of another medical con-\ndition (Criterion B). In determining whether the mood disturbance is due to a general\nmedical condition, the clinician must first establish the presence of a general medical con-\ndition. Further, the clinician must establish that the mood disturbance is etiologically re-\nlated to the general medical condition through a physiological mechanism. A careful and\ncomprehensive assessment of multiple factors is necessary to make this judgment. Al-\nthough there are no infallible guidelines for determining whether the relationship\nbetween the mood disturbance and the general medical condition is etiological, several\nconsiderations provide some guidance in this area. One consideration is the presence of a\ntemporal association between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of the general medical\ncondition and that of the mood disturbance. A second consideration is the presence of fea-\ntures that are atypical of primary Mood Disorders (e.g., atypical age at onset or course or\nabsence of family history). Evidence from the literature that suggests that there can be a di-\nrect association between the general medical condition in question and the development\nof mood symptoms can provide a useful context in the assessment of a particular situation.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nEtiology (i.e., a causal relationship to another medical condition based on best clinical ev-\nidence) is the key variable in depressive disorder due to another medical condition. The\nlisting of the medical conditions that are said to be able to induce major depression is never\ncomplete, and the clinician’s best judgment is the essence of this diagnosis.\nThere are clear associations, as well as some neuroanatomical correlates, of depression\nwith stroke, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and traumatic brain injury. Among\nthe neuroendocrine conditions most closely associated with depression are Cushing’s dis-\nease and hypothyroidism. There are numerous other conditions thought to be associated\nwith depression, such as multiple sclerosis. However, the literature’s support for a causal\nassociation is greater with some conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s\ndisease, than with others, for which the differential diagnosis may be adjustment disorder,\nwith depressed mood.\nDevelopment and Course\nFollowing stroke, the onset of depression appears to be very acute, occurring within 1 day\nor a few days of the cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in the largest case series. However, in\n182\nDepressive Disorders\nsome cases, onset of the depression is weeks to months following the CVA. In the largest\nseries, the duration of the major depressive episode following stroke was 9–11 months on\naverage. Similarly, in Huntington’s disease the depressive state comes quite early in the\ncourse of the illness. With Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease, it often precedes\nthe major motor impairments and cognitive impairments associated with each condition.\nThis is more prominently the case for Huntington’s disease, in which depression is con-\nsidered to be the first neuropsychiatric symptom. There is some observational evidence\nthat depression is less common as the dementia of Huntington’s disease progresses. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nThe risk of acute onset of a major depressive disorder following a CVA (within 1 day to a\nweek of the event) appears to be strongly correlated with lesion location, with greatest risk\nassociated with left frontal strokes and least risk apparently associated with right frontal\nlesions in those individuals who present within days of the stroke. The association with\nfrontal regions and laterality is not observed in depressive states that occur in the 2–6 months\nfollowing stroke.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nGender differences pertain to those associated with the medical condition (e.g., systemic\nlupus erythematosus is more common in females; stroke is somewhat more common in\nmiddle-age males compared with females).\nDiagnostic Markers\nDiagnostic markers pertain to those associated with the medical condition (e.g., steroid\nlevels in blood or urine to help corroborate the diagnosis of Cushing’s disease, which can\nbe associated with manic or depressive syndromes).\nSuicide Risk\nThere are no epidemiological studies that provide evidence to differentiate the risk of sui-\ncide from a major depressive episode due to another medical condition compared with the\nrisk from a major depressive episode in general. There are case reports of suicides in\nassociation with major depressive episodes associated with another medical condition.\nThere is a clear association between serious medical illnesses and suicide, particularly\nshortly after onset or diagnosis of the illness. Thus, it would be prudent to assume that the\nrisk of suicide for major depressive episodes associated with medical conditions is not less\nthan that for other forms of major depressive episode, and might even be greater.\nFunctional Consequences of Depressive Disorder \nDue to Another Medical Condition\nFunctional consequences pertain to those associated with the medical condition. In gen-\neral, it is believed, but not established, that a major depressive episode induced by Cush-\ning’s disease will not recur if the Cushing’s disease is cured or arrested. However, it is also\nsuggested, but not established, that mood syndromes, including depressive and manic/\nhypomanic ones, may be episodic (i.e., recurring) in some individuals with static brain in-\njuries and other central nervous system diseases.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nDepressive disorders not due to another medical condition.\nDetermination of whether\na medical condition accompanying a depressive disorder is causing the disorder depends\non a) the absence of an episode(s) of depressive episodes prior to the onset of the medical\nOther Specified Depressive Disorder\n183\ncondition, b) the probability that the associated medical condition has a potential to pro-\nmote or cause a depressive disorder, and c) a course of the depressive symptoms shortly\nafter the onset or worsening of the medical condition, especially if the depressive symp-\ntoms remit near the time that the medical disorder is effectively treated or remits.\nMedication-induced depressive disorder.\nAn important caveat is that some medical con-\nditions are treated with medications (e.g., steroids or alpha-interferon) that can induce depres-\nsive or manic symptoms. In these cases, clinical judgment, based on all the evidence in hand, is\nthe best way to try to separate the most likely and/or the most important of two etiological fac-\ntors (i.e., association with the medical condition vs. a substance-induced syndrome).\nAdjustment disorders.\nIt is important to differentiate a depressive episode from an ad-\njustment disorder, as the onset of the medical condition is in itself a life stressor that could\nbring on either an adjustment disorder or an episode of major depression. The major dif-\nferentiating elements are the pervasiveness the depressive picture and the number and\nquality of the depressive symptoms that the patient reports or demonstrates on the mental\nstatus examination. The differential diagnosis of the associated medical conditions is rel-\nevant but largely beyond the scope of the present manual. \nComorbidity\nConditions comorbid with depressive disorder due to another medical condition are those\nassociated with the medical conditions of etiological relevance. It has been noted that de-\nlirium can occur before or along with depressive symptoms in individuals with a variety\nof medical conditions, such as Cushing’s disease. The association of anxiety symptoms,\nusually generalized symptoms, is common in depressive disorders, regardless of cause.", "provenance": {"source_file": "depressive_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 6, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.443383"}}

Feeling that the individual might lose control of himself or herself.\nSpecify current severity:\nMild: Two symptoms.\nModerate: Three symptoms.\nModerate-severe: Four or five symptoms.\nSevere: Four or five symptoms and with motor agitation.\nNote: Anxious distress has been noted as a prominent feature of both bipolar and ma-\njor depressive disorder in both primary care and specialty mental health settings. High\nlevels of anxiety have been associated with higher suicide risk, longer duration of ill-\nness, and greater likelihood of treatment nonresponse. As a result, it is clinically useful\nto specify accurately the presence and severity levels of anxious distress for treatment\nplanning and monitoring of response to treatment.\nWith mixed features: \nA. At least three of the following manic/hypomanic symptoms are present nearly every\nday during the majority of days of a major depressive episode:\n1. Elevated, expansive mood.\n2. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.\n3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.\n4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.\n5. Increase in energy or goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or\nsexually).\nSpecifiers for Depressive Disorders\n185\n6. Increased or excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for\npainful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual in-\ndiscretions, foolish business investments).\n7. Decreased need for sleep (feeling rested despite sleeping less than usual; to be\ncontrasted with insomnia).\nB. Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from the per-\nson’s usual behavior.\nC. For individuals whose symptoms meet full criteria for either mania or hypomania,\nthe diagnosis should be bipolar I or bipolar II disorder.\nD. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance\n(e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication or other treatment).\nNote: Mixed features associated with a major depressive episode have been found\nto be a significant risk factor for the development of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder.\nAs a result, it is clinically useful to note the presence of this specifier for treatment\nplanning and monitoring of response to treatment.\nWith melancholic features:\nA. One of the following is present during the most severe period of the current epi-\nsode:\n1. Loss of pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.\n2. Lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli (does not feel much better, even\ntemporarily, when something good happens).\nB. Three (or more) of the following:\n1. A distinct quality of depressed mood characterized by profound despondency,\ndespair, and/or moroseness or by so-called empty mood.\n2. Depression that is regularly worse in the morning.\n3. Early-morning awakening (i.e., at least 2 hours before usual awakening).\n4. Marked psychomotor agitation or retardation.\n5. Significant anorexia or weight loss.\n6. Excessive or inappropriate guilt.\nNote: The specifier “with melancholic features” is applied if these features are present\nat the most severe stage of the episode. There is a near-complete absence of the ca-\npacity for pleasure, not merely a diminution. A guideline for evaluating the lack of reac-\ntivity of mood is that even highly desired events are not associated with marked\nbrightening of mood. Either mood does not brighten at all, or it brightens only partially\n(e.g., up to 20%–40% of normal for only minutes at a time). The “distinct quality” of mood\nthat is characteristic of the “with melancholic features” specifier is experienced as qual-\nitatively different from that during a nonmelancholic depressive episode. A depressed\nmood that is described as merely more severe, longer lasting, or present without a rea-\nson is not considered distinct in quality. Psychomotor changes are nearly always pres-\nent and are observable by others.\nMelancholic features exhibit only a modest tendency to repeat across episodes in the\nsame individual. They are more frequent in inpatients, as opposed to outpatients; are\nless likely to occur in milder than in more severe major depressive episodes; and are\nmore likely to occur in those with psychotic features.\nWith atypical features: This specifier can be applied when these features predomi-\nnate during the majority of days of the current or most recent major depressive episode\nor persistent depressive disorder. \nA. Mood reactivity (i.e., mood brightens in response to actual or potential positive\nevents).\n186\nDepressive Disorders\nB. Two (or more) of the following: \n1. Significant weight gain or increase in appetite.\n2. Hypersomnia.\n3. Leaden paralysis (i.e., heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs).\n4. A long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity (not limited to epi-\nsodes of mood disturbance) that results in significant social or occupational im-\npairment.\nC. Criteria are not met for “with melancholic features” or “with catatonia” during the\nsame episode.\nNote: “Atypical depression” has historical significance (i.e., atypical in contradistinction\nto the more classical agitated, “endogenous” presentations of depression that were the\nnorm when depression was rarely diagnosed in outpatients and almost never in ado-\nlescents or younger adults) and today does not connote an uncommon or unusual clin-\nical presentation as the term might imply.\nMood reactivity is the capacity to be cheered up when presented with positive events\n(e.g., a visit from children, compliments from others). Mood may become euthymic (not\nsad) even for extended periods of time if the external circumstances remain favorable.\nIncreased appetite may be manifested by an obvious increase in food intake or by\nweight gain. Hypersomnia may include either an extended period of nighttime sleep or\ndaytime napping that totals at least 10 hours of sleep per day (or at least 2 hours more\nthan when not depressed). Leaden paralysis is defined as feeling heavy, leaden, or\nweighted down, usually in the arms or legs. This sensation is generally present for at\nleast an hour a day but often lasts for many hours at a time. Unlike the other atypical\nfeatures, pathological sensitivity to perceived interpersonal rejection is a trait that has\nan early onset and persists throughout most of adult life. Rejection sensitivity occurs\nboth when the person is and is not depressed, though it may be exacerbated during\ndepressive periods.\nWith psychotic features: Delusions and/or hallucinations are present.\nWith mood-congruent psychotic features: The content of all delusions and hal-\nlucinations is consistent with the typical depressive themes of personal inade-\nquacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment.\nWith mood-incongruent psychotic features: The content of the delusions or hal-\nlucinations does not involve typical depressive themes of personal inadequacy,\nguilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment, or the content is a mixture\nof mood-incongruent and mood-congruent themes.\nWith catatonia: The catatonia specifier can apply to an episode of depression if cata-\ntonic features are present during most of the episode. See criteria for catatonia asso-\nciated with a mental disorder (for a description of catatonia, see the chapter\n“Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders”).\nWith peripartum onset: This specifier can be applied to the current or, if full criteria\nare not currently met for a major depressive episode, most recent episode of major de-\npression if onset of mood symptoms occurs during pregnancy or in the 4 weeks follow-\ning delivery.\nNote: Mood episodes can have their onset either during pregnancy or postpartum.\nAlthough the estimates differ according to the period of follow-up after delivery, be-\ntween 3% and 6% of women will experience the onset of a major depressive epi-\nsode during pregnancy or in the weeks or months following delivery. Fifty percent\nof “postpartum” major depressive episodes actually begin prior to delivery. Thus,\nthese episodes are referred to collectively as peripartum episodes. Women with\nperipartum major depressive episodes often have severe anxiety and even panic\nSpecifiers for Depressive Disorders\n187\nattacks. Prospective studies have demonstrated that mood and anxiety symptoms\nduring pregnancy, as well as the “baby blues,” increase the risk for a postpartum\nmajor depressive episode.\nPeripartum-onset mood episodes can present either with or without psychotic\nfeatures. Infanticide is most often associated with postpartum psychotic episodes\nthat are characterized by command hallucinations to kill the infant or delusions that\nthe infant is possessed, but psychotic symptoms can also occur in severe postpar-\ntum mood episodes without such specific delusions or hallucinations.\nPostpartum mood (major depressive or manic) episodes with psychotic features\nappear to occur in from 1 in 500 to 1 in 1,000 deliveries and may be more common\nin primiparous women. The risk of postpartum episodes with psychotic features is\nparticularly increased for women with prior postpartum mood episodes but is also\nelevated for those with a prior history of a depressive or bipolar disorder (especially\nbipolar I disorder) and those with a family history of bipolar disorders.\nOnce a woman has had a postpartum episode with psychotic features, the risk\nof recurrence with each subsequent delivery is between 30% and 50%. Postpartum\nepisodes must be differentiated from delirium occurring in the postpartum period,\nwhich is distinguished by a fluctuating level of awareness or attention. The postpar-\ntum period is unique with respect to the degree of neuroendocrine alterations and\npsychosocial adjustments, the potential impact of breast-feeding on treatment\nplanning, and the long-term implications of a history of postpartum mood disorder\non subsequent family planning.\nWith seasonal pattern: This specifier applies to recurrent major depressive disorder.\nA. There has been a regular temporal relationship between the onset of major depres-\nsive episodes in major depressive disorder and a particular time of the year (e.g.,\nin the fall or winter).\nNote: Do not include cases in which there is an obvious effect of seasonally related\npsychosocial stressors (e.g., regularly being unemployed every winter).\nB. Full remissions (or a change from major depression to mania or hypomania) also\noccur at a characteristic time of the year (e.g., depression disappears in the spring).\nC. In the last 2 years, two major depressive episodes have occurred that demonstrate\nthe temporal seasonal relationships defined above and no nonseasonal major de-\npressive episodes have occurred during that same period.\nD. Seasonal major depressive episodes (as described above) substantially outnum-\nber the nonseasonal major depressive episodes that may have occurred over the\nindividual’s lifetime.\nNote: The specifier “with seasonal pattern” can be applied to the pattern of major de-\npressive episodes in major depressive disorder, recurrent. The essential feature is the\nonset and remission of major depressive episodes at characteristic times of the year.\nIn most cases, the episodes begin in fall or winter and remit in spring. Less commonly,\nthere may be recurrent summer depressive episodes. This pattern of onset and remis-\nsion of episodes must have occurred during at least a 2-year period, without any non-\nseasonal episodes occurring during this period. In addition, the seasonal depressive\nepisodes must substantially outnumber any nonseasonal depressive episodes over\nthe individual’s lifetime.\nThis specifier does not apply to those situations in which the pattern is better ex-\nplained by seasonally linked psychosocial stressors (e.g., seasonal unemployment or\nschool schedule). Major depressive episodes that occur in a seasonal pattern are often\ncharacterized by prominent energy, hypersomnia, overeating, weight gain, and a crav-\ning for carbohydrates. It is unclear whether a seasonal pattern is more likely in recur-\nrent major depressive disorder or in bipolar disorders. However, within the bipolar\ndisorders group, a seasonal pattern appears to be more likely in bipolar II disorder than\n188\nDepressive Disorders\nin bipolar I disorder. In some individuals, the onset of manic or hypomanic episodes\nmay also be linked to a particular season.\nThe prevalence of winter-type seasonal pattern appears to vary with latitude, age,\nand sex. Prevalence increases with higher latitudes. Age is also a strong predictor of\nseasonality, with younger persons at higher risk for winter depressive episodes.\nSpecify if:\nIn partial remission: Symptoms of the immediately previous major depressive episode\nare present, but full criteria are not met, or there is a period lasting less than 2 months\nwithout any significant symptoms of a major depressive episode following the end of\nsuch an episode.\nIn full remission: During the past 2 months, no significant signs or symptoms of the\ndisturbance were present.\nSpecify current severity:\nSeverity is based on the number of criterion symptoms, the severity of those symptoms,\nand the degree of functional disability.\nMild: Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are\npresent, the intensity of the symptoms is distressing but manageable, and the symp-\ntoms result in minor impairment in social or occupational functioning.\nModerate: The number of symptoms, intensity of symptoms, and/or functional impair-\nment are between those specified for “mild” and “severe.”\nSevere: The number of symptoms is substantially in excess of that required to make\nthe diagnosis, the intensity of the symptoms is seriously distressing and unmanage-\nable, and the symptoms markedly interfere with social and occupational functioning.\n189", "provenance": {"source_file": "depressive_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 8, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.443383"}}
