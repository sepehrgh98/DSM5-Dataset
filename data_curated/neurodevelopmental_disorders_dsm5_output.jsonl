The following three criteria must be met:\nA. Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract\nthinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, confirmed by\nboth clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence testing.\nB. Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet developmental and socio-\ncultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongo-\ning support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life,\nsuch as communication, social participation, and independent living, across multiple\nenvironments, such as home, school, work, and community.\nC. Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period.\nNote: The diagnostic term intellectual disability is the equivalent term for the ICD-11 diag-\nnosis of intellectual developmental disorders. Although the term intellectual disability is\nused throughout this manual, both terms are used in the title to clarify relationships with\nother classification systems. Moreover, a federal statute in the United States (Public Law\n111-256, Rosa’s Law) replaces the term mental retardation with intellectual disability, and\nresearch journals use the term intellectual disability. Thus, intellectual disability is the\nterm in common use by medical, educational, and other professions and by the lay public\nand advocacy groups.\nSpecify current severity (see Table 1): \n317 (F70)    Mild\n318.0 (F71) Moderate\n318.1 (F72) Severe\n318.2 (F73) Profound\nSpecifiers\nThe various levels of severity are defined on the basis of adaptive functioning, and not IQ\nscores, because it is adaptive functioning that determines the level of supports required.\nMoreover, IQ measures are less valid in the lower end of the IQ range. \n34\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nTABLE 1 Severity levels for intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder)\nSeverity \nlevel\nConceptual domain\nSocial domain\nPractical domain\nMild \nFor preschool children, there \nmay be no obvious conceptual \ndifferences. For school-age \nchildren and adults, there are \ndifficulties in learning aca-\ndemic skills involving reading, \nwriting, arithmetic, time, or \nmoney, with support needed \nin one or more areas to meet \nage-related expectations. In \nadults, abstract thinking, exec-\nutive function (i.e., planning, \nstrategizing, priority setting, \nand cognitive flexibility), and \nshort-term memory, as well as \nfunctional use of academic \nskills (e.g., reading, money \nmanagement), are impaired. \nThere is a somewhat concrete \napproach to problems and \nsolutions compared with \nage-mates. \nCompared with typically developing age-\nmates, the individual is immature in social \ninteractions. For example, there may be diffi-\nculty in accurately perceiving peers’ social \ncues. Communication, conversation, and lan-\nguage are more concrete or immature than \nexpected for age. There may be difficulties reg-\nulating emotion and behavior in age-appropri-\nate fashion; these difficulties are noticed by \npeers in social situations. There is limited \nunderstanding of risk in social situations; \nsocial judgment is immature for age, and \nthe person is at risk of being manipulated \nby others (gullibility).\nThe individual may function age-appropriately in \npersonal care. Individuals need some support with \ncomplex daily living tasks in comparison to peers. In \nadulthood, supports typically involve grocery shop-\nping, transportation, home and child-care organiz-\ning, nutritious food preparation, and banking and \nmoney management. Recreational skills resemble \nthose of age-mates, although judgment related to \nwell-being and organization around recreation \nrequires support. In adulthood, competitive \nemployment is often seen in jobs that do not empha-\nsize conceptual skills. Individuals generally need \nsupport to make health care decisions and legal \ndecisions, and to learn to perform a skilled vocation \ncompetently. Support is typically needed to raise a \nfamily.\nIntellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder)\n35\nModerate \nAll through development, the \nindividual’s conceptual skills \nlag markedly behind those of \npeers. For preschoolers, lan-\nguage and pre-academic skills \ndevelop slowly. For school-age \nchildren, progress in reading, \nwriting, mathematics, and \nunderstanding of time and \nmoney occurs slowly across \nthe school years and is mark-\nedly limited compared with \nthat of peers. For adults, aca-\ndemic skill development is \ntypically at an elementary \nlevel, and support is required \nfor all use of academic skills in \nwork and personal life. Ongo-\ning assistance on a daily basis \nis needed to complete concep-\ntual tasks of day-to-day life, \nand others may take over these \nresponsibilities fully for the \nindividual.\nThe individual shows marked differences from \npeers in social and communicative behavior \nacross development. Spoken language is typi-\ncally a primary tool for social communication \nbut is much less complex than that of peers. \nCapacity for relationships is evident in ties to \nfamily and friends, and the individual may \nhave successful friendships across life and \nsometimes romantic relations in adulthood. \nHowever, individuals may not perceive or \ninterpret social cues accurately. Social judg-\nment and decision-making abilities are lim-\nited, and caretakers must assist the person \nwith life decisions. Friendships with typically \ndeveloping peers are often affected by com-\nmunication or social limitations. Significant \nsocial and communicative support is needed \nin work settings for success. \nThe individual can care for personal needs involving \neating, dressing, elimination, and hygiene as an \nadult, although an extended period of teaching and \ntime is needed for the individual to become indepen-\ndent in these areas, and reminders may be needed. \nSimilarly, participation in all household tasks can be \nachieved by adulthood, although an extended \nperiod of teaching is needed, and ongoing supports \nwill typically occur for adult-level performance. \nIndependent employment in jobs that require lim-\nited conceptual and communication skills can be \nachieved, but considerable support from co-work-\ners, supervisors, and others is needed to manage \nsocial expectations, job complexities, and ancillary \nresponsibilities such as scheduling, transportation, \nhealth benefits, and money management. A variety \nof recreational skills can be developed. These typi-\ncally require additional supports and learning \nopportunities over an extended period of time. \nMaladaptive behavior is present in a significant \nminority and causes social problems.\nTABLE 1 Severity levels for intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) (continued)\nSeverity \nlevel\nConceptual domain\nSocial domain\nPractical domain\n36\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nSevere\nAttainment of conceptual skills \nis limited. The individual gen-\nerally has little understanding \nof written language or of con-\ncepts involving numbers, \nquantity, time, and money. \nCaretakers provide extensive \nsupports for problem solving \nthroughout life. \nSpoken language is quite limited in terms of \nvocabulary and grammar. Speech may be sin-\ngle words or phrases and may be supple-\nmented through augmentative means. Speech \nand communication are focused on the here \nand now within everyday events. Language is \nused for social communication more than for \nexplication. Individuals understand simple \nspeech and gestural communication. Relation-\nships with family members and familiar others \nare a source of pleasure and help. \nThe individual requires support for all activities of \ndaily living, including meals, dressing, bathing, and \nelimination. The individual requires supervision at \nall times. The individual cannot make responsible \ndecisions regarding well-being of self or others. In \nadulthood, participation in tasks at home, recre-\nation, and work requires ongoing support and assis-\ntance. Skill acquisition in all domains involves long-\nterm teaching and ongoing support. Maladaptive \nbehavior, including self-injury, is present in a signif-\nicant minority. \nProfound\nConceptual skills generally \ninvolve the physical world \nrather than symbolic pro-\ncesses. The individual may use \nobjects in goal-directed fashion \nfor self-care, work, and recre-\nation. Certain visuospatial \nskills, such as matching and \nsorting based on physical char-\nacteristics, may be acquired. \nHowever, co-occurring motor \nand sensory impairments may \nprevent functional use of \nobjects. \nThe individual has very limited understanding \nof symbolic communication in speech or ges-\nture. He or she may understand some simple \ninstructions or gestures. The individual \nexpresses his or her own desires and emotions \nlargely through nonverbal, nonsymbolic com-\nmunication. The individual enjoys relation-\nships with well-known family members, \ncaretakers, and familiar others, and initiates \nand responds to social interactions through \ngestural and emotional cues. Co-occurring \nsensory and physical impairments may pre-\nvent many social activities. \nThe individual is dependent on others for all aspects of \ndaily physical care, health, and safety, although he or \nshe may be able to participate in some of these activi-\nties as well. Individuals without severe physical \nimpairments may assist with some daily work tasks at \nhome, like carrying dishes to the table. Simple actions \nwith objects may be the basis of participation in some \nvocational activities with high levels of ongoing sup-\nport. Recreational activities may involve, for example, \nenjoyment in listening to music, watching movies, \ngoing out for walks, or participating in water activi-\nties, all with the support of others. Co-occurring \nphysical and sensory impairments are frequent \nbarriers to participation (beyond watching) in home, \nrecreational, and vocational activities. Maladaptive \nbehavior is present in a significant minority.\nTABLE 1 Severity levels for intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) (continued)\nSeverity \nlevel\nConceptual domain\nSocial domain\nPractical domain\nIntellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder)\n37\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential features of intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) are\ndeficits in general mental abilities (Criterion A) and impairment in everyday adaptive\nfunctioning, in comparison to an individual’s age-, gender-, and socioculturally matched\npeers (Criterion B). Onset is during the developmental period (Criterion C). The diagnosis\nof intellectual disability is based on both clinical assessment and standardized testing of\nintellectual and adaptive functions.\nCriterion A refers to intellectual functions that involve reasoning, problem solving,\nplanning, abstract thinking, judgment, learning from instruction and experience, and\npractical understanding. Critical components include verbal comprehension, working\nmemory, perceptual reasoning, quantitative reasoning, abstract thought, and cognitive ef-\nficacy. Intellectual functioning is typically measured with individually administered and\npsychometrically valid, comprehensive, culturally appropriate, psychometrically sound\ntests of intelligence. Individuals with intellectual disability have scores of approximately\ntwo standard deviations or more below the population mean, including a margin for mea-\nsurement error (generally +5 points). On tests with a standard deviation of 15 and a mean\nof 100, this involves a score of 65–75 (70 ± 5). Clinical training and judgment are required\nto interpret test results and assess intellectual performance.\nFactors that may affect test scores include practice effects and the “Flynn effect’ (i.e.,\noverly high scores due to out-of-date test norms). Invalid scores may result from the use of\nbrief intelligence screening tests or group tests; highly discrepant individual subtest scores\nmay make an overall IQ score invalid. Instruments must be normed for the individual’s so-\nciocultural background and native language. Co-occurring disorders that affect communi-\ncation, language, and/or motor or sensory function may affect test scores. Individual\ncognitive profiles based on neuropsychological testing are more useful for understanding\nintellectual abilities than a single IQ score. Such testing may identify areas of relative\nstrengths and weaknesses, an assessment important for academic and vocational planning.\nIQ test scores are approximations of conceptual functioning but may be insufficient to\nassess reasoning in real-life situations and mastery of practical tasks. For example, a per-\nson with an IQ score above 70 may have such severe adaptive behavior problems in social\njudgment, social understanding, and other areas of adaptive functioning that the person’s\nactual functioning is comparable to that of individuals with a lower IQ score. Thus, clinical\njudgment is needed in interpreting the results of IQ tests.\nDeficits in adaptive functioning (Criterion B) refer to how well a person meets community\nstandards of personal independence and social responsibility, in comparison to others of sim-\nilar age and sociocultural background. Adaptive functioning involves adaptive reasoning in\nthree domains: conceptual, social, and practical. The conceptual (academic) domain involves\ncompetence in memory, language, reading, writing, math reasoning, acquisition of practical\nknowledge, problem solving, and judgment in novel situations, among others. The social do-\nmain involves awareness of others’ thoughts, feelings, and experiences; empathy; interper-\nsonal communication skills; friendship abilities; and social judgment, among others. The\npractical domain involves learning and self-management across life settings, including personal\ncare, job responsibilities, money management, recreation, self-management of behavior, and\nschool and work task organization, among others. Intellectual capacity, education, motivation,\nsocialization, personality features, vocational opportunity, cultural experience, and coexisting\ngeneral medical conditions or mental disorders influence adaptive functioning.\nAdaptive functioning is assessed using both clinical evaluation and individualized,\nculturally appropriate, psychometrically sound measures. Standardized measures are\nused with knowledgeable informants (e.g., parent or other family member; teacher; coun-\nselor; care provider) and the individual to the extent possible. Additional sources of infor-\nmation include educational, developmental, medical, and mental health evaluations.\nScores from standardized measures and interview sources must be interpreted using clin-\nical judgment. When standardized testing is difficult or impossible, because of a variety of\n38\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nfactors (e.g., sensory impairment, severe problem behavior), the individual may be diag-\nnosed with unspecified intellectual disability. Adaptive functioning may be difficult to\nassess in a controlled setting (e.g., prisons, detention centers); if possible, corroborative in-\nformation reflecting functioning outside those settings should be obtained.\nCriterion B is met when at least one domain of adaptive functioning—conceptual, so-\ncial, or practical—is sufficiently impaired that ongoing support is needed in order for the\nperson to perform adequately in one or more life settings at school, at work, at home, or in\nthe community. To meet diagnostic criteria for intellectual disability, the deficits in adap-\ntive functioning must be directly related to the intellectual impairments described in Cri-\nterion A. Criterion C, onset during the developmental period, refers to recognition that\nintellectual and adaptive deficits are present during childhood or adolescence.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIntellectual disability is a heterogeneous condition with multiple causes. There may be\nassociated difficulties with social judgment; assessment of risk; self-management of behav-\nior, emotions, or interpersonal relationships; or motivation in school or work environments.\nLack of communication skills may predispose to disruptive and aggressive behaviors. Gull-\nibility is often a feature, involving naiveté in social situations and a tendency for being easily\nled by others. Gullibility and lack of awareness of risk may result in exploitation by others\nand possible victimization, fraud, unintentional criminal involvement, false confessions,\nand risk for physical and sexual abuse. These associated features can be important in crim-\ninal cases, including Atkins-type hearings involving the death penalty.\nIndividuals with a diagnosis of intellectual disability with co-occurring mental disor-\nders are at risk for suicide. They think about suicide, make suicide attempts, and may die\nfrom them. Thus, screening for suicidal thoughts is essential in the assessment process. Be-\ncause of a lack of awareness of risk and danger, accidental injury rates may be increased.\nPrevalence\nIntellectual disability has an overall general population prevalence of approximately 1%,\nand prevalence rates vary by age. Prevalence for severe intellectual disability is approxi-\nmately 6 per 1,000.\nDevelopment and Course\nOnset of intellectual disability is in the developmental period. The age and characteristic\nfeatures at onset depend on the etiology and severity of brain dysfunction. Delayed motor,\nlanguage, and social milestones may be identifiable within the first 2 years of life among\nthose with more severe intellectual disability, while mild levels may not be identifiable un-\ntil school age when difficulty with academic learning becomes apparent. All criteria (in-\ncluding Criterion C) must be fulfilled by history or current presentation. Some children\nunder age 5 years whose presentation will eventually meet criteria for intellectual disabil-\nity have deficits that meet criteria for global developmental delay.\nWhen intellectual disability is associated with a genetic syndrome, there may be a char-\nacteristic physical appearance (as in, e.g., Down syndrome). Some syndromes have a\nbehavioral phenotype, which refers to specific behaviors that are characteristic of particular\ngenetic disorder (e.g., Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). In acquired forms, the onset may be\nabrupt following an illness such as meningitis or encephalitis or head trauma occurring\nduring the developmental period. When intellectual disability results from a loss of pre-\nviously acquired cognitive skills, as in severe traumatic brain injury, the diagnoses of in-\ntellectual disability and of a neurocognitive disorder may both be assigned.\nAlthough intellectual disability is generally nonprogressive, in certain genetic disor-\nders (e.g., Rett syndrome) there are periods of worsening, followed by stabilization, and in\nIntellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder)\n39\nothers (e.g., San Phillippo syndrome) progressive worsening of intellectual function. After\nearly childhood, the disorder is generally lifelong, although severity levels may change\nover time. The course may be influenced by underlying medical or genetic conditions and\nco-occurring conditions (e.g., hearing or visual impairments, epilepsy). Early and ongoing in-\nterventions may improve adaptive functioning throughout childhood and adulthood. In\nsome cases, these result in significant improvement of intellectual functioning, such that\nthe diagnosis of intellectual disability is no longer appropriate. Thus, it is common practice\nwhen assessing infants and young children to delay diagnosis of intellectual disability un-\ntil after an appropriate course of intervention is provided. For older children and adults,\nthe extent of support provided may allow for full participation in all activities of daily liv-\ning and improved adaptive function. Diagnostic assessments must determine whether im-\nproved adaptive skills are the result of a stable, generalized new skill acquisition (in which\ncase the diagnosis of intellectual disability may no longer be appropriate) or whether the\nimprovement is contingent on the presence of supports and ongoing interventions (in\nwhich case the diagnosis of intellectual disability may still be appropriate).\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nGenetic and physiological.\nPrenatal etiologies include genetic syndromes (e.g., se-\nquence variations or copy number variants involving one or more genes; chromosomal\ndisorders), inborn errors of metabolism, brain malformations, maternal disease (including\nplacental disease), and environmental influences (e.g., alcohol, other drugs, toxins, terato-\ngens). Perinatal causes include a variety of labor and delivery-related events leading to\nneonatal encephalopathy. Postnatal causes include hypoxic ischemic injury, traumatic\nbrain injury, infections, demyelinating disorders, seizure disorders (e.g., infantile spasms),\nsevere and chronic social deprivation, and toxic metabolic syndromes and intoxications\n(e.g., lead, mercury).\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues \nIntellectual disability occurs in all races and cultures. Cultural sensitivity and knowledge\nare needed during assessment, and the individual’s ethnic, cultural, and linguistic back-\nground, available experiences, and adaptive functioning within his or her community and\ncultural setting must be taken into account.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nOverall, males are more likely than females to be diagnosed with both mild (average\nmale:female ratio 1.6:1) and severe (average male:female ratio 1.2:1) forms of intellectual\ndisability. However, gender ratios vary widely in reported studies. Sex-linked genetic fac-\ntors and male vulnerability to brain insult may account for some of the gender differences.\nDiagnostic Markers\nA comprehensive evaluation includes an assessment of intellectual capacity and adaptive\nfunctioning; identification of genetic and nongenetic etiologies; evaluation for associated\nmedical conditions (e.g., cerebral palsy, seizure disorder); and evaluation for co-occurring\nmental, emotional, and behavioral disorders. Components of the evaluation may include\nbasic pre- and perinatal medical history, three-generational family pedigree, physical exam-\nination, genetic evaluation (e.g., karyotype or chromosomal microarray analysis and testing\nfor specific genetic syndromes), and metabolic screening and neuroimaging assessment.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThe diagnosis of intellectual disability should be made whenever Criteria A, B, and C are\nmet. A diagnosis of intellectual disability should not be assumed because of a particular\n40\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\ngenetic or medical condition. A genetic syndrome linked to intellectual disability should\nbe noted as a concurrent diagnosis with the intellectual disability.\nMajor and mild neurocognitive disorders.\nIntellectual disability is categorized as a neu-\nrodevelopmental disorder and is distinct from the neurocognitive disorders, which are\ncharacterized by a loss of cognitive functioning. Major neurocognitive disorder may co-\noccur with intellectual disability (e.g., an individual with Down syndrome who develops\nAlzheimer’s disease, or an individual with intellectual disability who loses further cogni-\ntive capacity following a head injury). In such cases, the diagnoses of intellectual disability\nand neurocognitive disorder may both be given.\nCommunication disorders and specific learning disorder.\nThese neurodevelopmental\ndisorders are specific to the communication and learning domains and do not show defi-\ncits in intellectual and adaptive behavior. They may co-occur with intellectual disability.\nBoth diagnoses are made if full criteria are met for intellectual disability and a communi-\ncation disorder or specific learning disorder.\nAutism spectrum disorder.\nIntellectual disability is common among individuals with\nautism spectrum disorder. Assessment of intellectual ability may be complicated by so-\ncial-communication and behavior deficits inherent to autism spectrum disorder, which\nmay interfere with understanding and complying with test procedures. Appropriate as-\nsessment of intellectual functioning in autism spectrum disorder is essential, with reas-\nsessment across the developmental period, because IQ scores in autism spectrum disorder\nmay be unstable, particularly in early childhood.\nComorbidity\nCo-occurring mental, neurodevelopmental, medical, and physical conditions are frequent\nin intellectual disability, with rates of some conditions (e.g., mental disorders, cerebral\npalsy, and epilepsy) three to four times higher than in the general population. The prognosis\nand outcome of co-occurring diagnoses may be influenced by the presence of intellectual\ndisability. Assessment procedures may require modifications because of associated disor-\nders, including communication disorders, autism spectrum disorder, and motor, sensory,\nor other disorders. Knowledgeable informants are essential for identifying symptoms\nsuch as irritability, mood dysregulation, aggression, eating problems, and sleep problems,\nand for assessing adaptive functioning in various community settings.\nThe most common co-occurring mental and neurodevelopmental disorders are atten-\ntion-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; depressive and bipolar disorders; anxiety disorders;\nautism spectrum disorder; stereotypic movement disorder (with or without self-injurious\nbehavior); impulse-control disorders; and major neurocognitive disorder. Major depres-\nsive disorder may occur throughout the range of severity of intellectual disability. Self-\ninjurious behavior requires prompt diagnostic attention and may warrant a separate di-\nagnosis of stereotypic movement disorder. Individuals with intellectual disability, partic-\nularly those with more severe intellectual disability, may also exhibit aggression and\ndisruptive behaviors, including harm of others or property destruction.\nRelationship to Other Classifications\nICD-11 (in development at the time of this publication) uses the term intellectual develop-\nmental disorders to indicate that these are disorders that involve impaired brain functioning\nearly in life. These disorders are described in ICD-11 as a metasyndrome occurring in the\ndevelopmental period analogous to dementia or neurocognitive disorder in later life.\nThere are four subtypes in ICD-11: mild, moderate, severe, and profound.\nThe American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD)\nalso uses the term intellectual disability with a similar meaning to the term as used in this\nGlobal Developmental Delay\n41\nmanual. The AAIDD’s classification is multidimensional rather than categorical and is\nbased on the disability construct. Rather than listing specifiers as is done in DSM-5, the\nAAIDD emphasizes a profile of supports based on severity.", "provenance": {"source_file": "neurodevelopmental_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 1, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.483383"}}

Language includes the form, function, and use of a\nconventional system of symbols (i.e., spoken words, sign language, written words, pic-\ntures) in a rule-governed manner for communication. Communication includes any verbal\nor nonverbal behavior (whether intentional or unintentional) that influences the behavior,\nideas, or attitudes of another individual.

Persistent difficulties in the acquisition and use of language across modalities (i.e.,\nspoken, written, sign language, or other) due to deficits in comprehension or produc-\ntion that include the following:\n1. Reduced vocabulary (word knowledge and use).\n2. Limited sentence structure (ability to put words and word endings together to form\nsentences based on the rules of grammar and morphology).\n3. Impairments in discourse (ability to use vocabulary and connect sentences to ex-\nplain or describe a topic or series of events or have a conversation).\nB. Language abilities are substantially and quantifiably below those expected for age, re-\nsulting in functional limitations in effective communication, social participation, aca-\ndemic achievement, or occupational performance, individually or in any combination.\nC. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.\nD. The difficulties are not attributable to hearing or other sensory impairment, motor dys-\nfunction, or another medical or neurological condition and are not better explained by in-\ntellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental delay.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe core diagnostic features of language disorder are difficulties in the acquisition and use\nof language due to deficits in the comprehension or production of vocabulary, sentence\nstructure, and discourse. The language deficits are evident in spoken communication,\nwritten communication, or sign language. Language learning and use is dependent on\nboth receptive and expressive skills. Expressive ability refers to the production of vocal, ges-\ntural, or verbal signals, while receptive ability refers to the process of receiving and com-\nprehending language messages. Language skills need to be assessed in both expressive\nand receptive modalities as these may differ in severity. For example, an individual’s ex-\npressive language may be severely impaired, while his receptive language is hardly im-\npaired at all.\nLanguage disorder usually affects vocabulary and grammar, and these effects then\nlimit the capacity for discourse. The child’s first words and phrases are likely to be delayed\nin onset; vocabulary size is smaller and less varied than expected; and sentences are\nshorter and less complex with grammatical errors, especially in past tense. Deficits in com-\nprehension of language are frequently underestimated, as children may be good at using\ncontext to infer meaning. There may be word-finding problems, impoverished verbal def-\ninitions, or poor understanding of synonyms, multiple meanings, or word play appro-\npriate for age and culture. Problems with remembering new words and sentences are\nmanifested by difficulties following instructions of increasing length, difficulties rehears-\ning strings of verbal information (e.g., remembering a phone number or a shopping list),\nand difficulties remembering novel sound sequences, a skill that may be important for\nlearning new words. Difficulties with discourse are shown by a reduced ability to provide\nadequate information about the key events and to narrate a coherent story.\nThe language difficulty is manifest by abilities substantially and quantifiably below\nthat expected for age and significantly interfering with academic achievement, occupa-\ntional performance, effective communication, or socialization (Criterion B). A diagnosis of\nlanguage disorder is made based on the synthesis of the individual’s history, direct clinical\nobservation in different contexts (i.e., home, school, or work), and scores from standard-\nized tests of language ability that can be used to guide estimates of severity.\nLanguage Disorder\n43\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nA positive family history of language disorders is often present. Individuals, even chil-\ndren, can be adept at accommodating to their limited language. They may appear to be shy\nor reticent to talk. Affected individuals may prefer to communicate only with family mem-\nbers or other familiar individuals. Although these social indicators are not diagnostic of a\nlanguage disorder, if they are notable and persistent, they warrant referral for a full lan-\nguage assessment. Language disorder, particularly expressive deficits, may co-occur with\nspeech sound disorder.\nDevelopment and Course\nLanguage acquisition is marked by changes from onset in toddlerhood to the adult level of\ncompetency that appears during adolescence. Changes appear across the dimensions of\nlanguage (sounds, words, grammar, narratives/expository texts, and conversational\nskills) in age-graded increments and synchronies. Language disorder emerges during the\nearly developmental period; however, there is considerable variation in early vocabulary\nacquisition and early word combinations, and individual differences are not, as single\nindicators, highly predictive of later outcomes. By age 4 years, individual differences in\nlanguage ability are more stable, with better measurement accuracy, and are highly pre-\ndictive of later outcomes. Language disorder diagnosed from 4 years of age is likely to be\nstable over time and typically persists into adulthood, although the particular profile of\nlanguage strengths and deficits is likely to change over the course of development.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nChildren with receptive language impairments have a poorer prognosis than those with\npredominantly expressive impairments. They are more resistant to treatment, and diffi-\nculties with reading comprehension are frequently seen.\nGenetic and physiological.\nLanguage disorders are highly heritable, and family mem-\nbers are more likely to have a history of language impairment.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nNormal variations in language.\nLanguage disorder needs to be distinguished from nor-\nmal developmental variations, and this distinction may be difficult to make before 4 years\nof age. Regional, social, or cultural/ethnic variations of language (e.g., dialects) must be\nconsidered when an individual is being assessed for language impairment.\nHearing or other sensory impairment.\nHearing impairment needs to be excluded as the\nprimary cause of language difficulties.

Persistent difficulty with speech sound production that interferes with speech intelligi-\nbility or prevents verbal communication of messages. \nB. The disturbance causes limitations in effective communication that interfere with social\nparticipation, academic achievement, or occupational performance, individually or in\nany combination.\nC. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.\nD. The difficulties are not attributable to congenital or acquired conditions, such as cere-\nbral palsy, cleft palate, deafness or hearing loss, traumatic brain injury, or other medi-\ncal or neurological conditions. \nDiagnostic Features \nSpeech sound production describes the clear articulation of the phonemes (i.e., individual\nsounds) that in combination make up spoken words. Speech sound production requires both\nthe phonological knowledge of speech sounds and the ability to coordinate the movements of\nthe articulators (i.e., the jaw, tongue, and lips,) with breathing and vocalizing for speech. Chil-\ndren with speech production difficulties may experience difficulty with phonological knowl-\nedge of speech sounds or the ability to coordinate movements for speech in varying degrees.\nSpeech sound disorder is thus heterogeneous in its underlying mechanisms and includes pho-\nnological disorder and articulation disorder. A speech sound disorder is diagnosed when\nspeech sound production is not what would be expected based on the child’s age and devel-\nopmental stage and when the deficits are not the result of a physical, structural, neurological,\nor hearing impairment. Among typically developing children at age 4 years, overall speech\nshould be intelligible, whereas at age 2 years, only 50% may be understandable.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nLanguage disorder, particularly expressive deficits, may be found to co-occur with speech\nsound disorder. A positive family history of speech or language disorders is often present. \nIf the ability to rapidly coordinate the articulators is a particular aspect of difficulty,\nthere may be a history of delay or incoordination in acquiring skills that also utilize the\narticulators and related facial musculature; among others, these skills include chewing,\nmaintaining mouth closure, and blowing the nose. Other areas of motor coordination may\nbe impaired as in developmental coordination disorder. Verbal dyspraxia is a term also\nused for speech production problems.\nSpeech may be differentially impaired in certain genetic conditions (e.g., Down syn-\ndrome, 22q deletion, FoxP2 gene mutation). If present, these should also be coded.\nDevelopment and Course\nLearning to produce speech sounds clearly and accurately and learning to produce con-\nnected speech fluently are developmental skills. Articulation of speech sounds follows a\nChildhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)\n45\ndevelopmental pattern, which is reflected in the age norms of standardized tests. It is not\nunusual for typically developing children to use developmental processes for shortening\nwords and syllables as they are learning to talk, but their progression in mastering speech\nsound production should result in mostly intelligible speech by age 3 years. Children with\nspeech sound disorder continue to use immature phonological simplification processes\npast the age when most children can produce words clearly.\nMost speech sounds should be produced clearly and most words should be pronounced\naccurately according to age and community norms by age 7 years. The most frequently mis-\narticulated sounds also tend to be learned later, leading them to be called the “late eight” (l, r,\ns, z, th, ch, dzh, and zh). Misarticulation of any of these sounds by itself could be considered\nwithin normal limits up to age 8 years. When multiple sounds are involved, it may be appro-\npriate to target some of those sounds as part of a plan to improve intelligibility prior to the age\nat which almost all children can produce them accurately. Lisping (i.e., misarticulating sibi-\nlants) is particularly common and may involve frontal or lateral patterns of airstream direc-\ntion. It may be associated with an abnormal tongue-thrust swallowing pattern.\nMost children with speech sound disorder respond well to treatment, and speech dif-\nficulties improve over time, and thus the disorder may not be lifelong. However, when a\nlanguage disorder is also present, the speech disorder has a poorer prognosis and may be\nassociated with specific learning disorders.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nNormal variations in speech.\nRegional, social, or cultural/ethnic variations of speech\nshould be considered before making the diagnosis.\nHearing or other sensory impairment.\nHearing impairment or deafness may result in\nabnormalities of speech. Deficits of speech sound production may be associated with a\nhearing impairment, other sensory deficit, or a speech-motor deficit. When speech deficits\nare in excess of those usually associated with these problems, a diagnosis of speech sound\ndisorder may be made.\nStructural deficits.\nSpeech impairment may be due to structural deficits (e.g., cleft palate).\nDysarthria.\nSpeech impairment may be attributable to a motor disorder, such as cerebral\npalsy. Neurological signs, as well as distinctive features of voice, differentiate dysarthria\nfrom speech sound disorder, although in young children (under 3 years) differentiation\nmay be difficult, particularly when there is no or minimal general body motor involve-\nment (as in, e.g., Worster-Drought syndrome).\nSelective mutism.\nLimited use of speech may be a sign of selective mutism, an anxiety\ndisorder that is characterized by a lack of speech in one or more contexts or settings. Se-\nlective mutism may develop in children with a speech disorder because of embarassment\nabout their impairments, but many children with selective mutism exhibit normal speech\nin “safe” settings, such as at home or with close friends.", "provenance": {"source_file": "neurodevelopmental_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 5, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.483383"}}

This disturbance is characterized by frequent repetitions or prolongations of sounds\nor syllables and by other types of speech dysfluencies, including broken words (e.g.,\npauses within a word), audible or silent blocking (i.e., filled or unfilled pauses in speech),\ncircumlocutions (i.e., word substitutions to avoid problematic words), words produced\nwith an excess of physical tension, and monosyllabic whole-word repetitions (e.g., “I-I-I-I\nsee him”). The disturbance in fluency interferes with academic or occupational achieve-\nment or with social communication. The extent of the disturbance varies from situation to\nsituation and often is more severe when there is special pressure to communicate (e.g., giv-\ning a report at school, interviewing for a job). Dysfluency is often absent during oral read-\ning, singing, or talking to inanimate objects or to pets.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nFearful anticipation of the problem may develop. The speaker may attempt to avoid dys-\nfluencies by linguistic mechanisms (e.g., altering the rate of speech, avoiding certain\nwords or sounds) or by avoiding certain speech situations, such as telephoning or public\nspeaking. In addition to being features of the condition, stress and anxiety have been\nshown to exacerbate dysfluency.\nChildhood-onset fluency disorder may also be accompanied by motor movements\n(e.g., eye blinks, tics, tremors of the lips or face, jerking of the head, breathing movements,\nfist clenching). Children with fluency disorder show a range of language abilities, and the\nrelationship between fluency disorder and language abilities is unclear.\nDevelopment and Course\nChildhood-onset fluency disorder, or developmental stuttering, occurs by age 6 for 80%–\n90% of affected individuals, with age at onset ranging from 2 to 7 years. The onset can be\ninsidious or more sudden. Typically, dysfluencies start gradually, with repetition of initial\nconsonants, first words of a phrase, or long words. The child may not be aware of dysflu-\nencies. As the disorder progresses, the dysfluencies become more frequent and interfering,\noccurring on the most meaningful words or phrases in the utterance. As the child becomes\naware of the speech difficulty, he or she may develop mechanisms for avoiding the dys-\nfluencies and emotional responses, including avoidance of public speaking and use of\nshort and simple utterances. Longitudinal research shows that 65%–85% of children re-\nSocial (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder\n47\ncover from the dysfluency, with severity of fluency disorder at age 8 years predicting re-\ncovery or persistence into adolescence and beyond.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nGenetic and physiological.\nThe risk of stuttering among first-degree biological rela-\ntives of individuals with childhood-onset fluency disorder is more than three times the\nrisk in the general population.\nFunctional Consequences of \nChildhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)\nIn addition to being features of the condition, stress and anxiety can exacerbate dysflu-\nency. Impairment of social functioning may result from this anxiety.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nSensory deficits.\nDysfluencies of speech may be associated with a hearing impairment\nor other sensory deficit or a speech-motor deficit. When the speech dysfluencies are in ex-\ncess of those usually associated with these problems, a diagnosis of childhood-onset flu-\nency disorder may be made.\nNormal speech dysfluencies.\nThe disorder must be distinguished from normal dysflu-\nencies that occur frequently in young children, which include whole-word or phrase rep-\netitions (e.g., “I want, I want ice cream”), incomplete phrases, interjections, unfilled\npauses, and parenthetical remarks. If these difficulties increase in frequency or complexity\nas the child grows older, a diagnosis of childhood-onset fluency disorder is appropriate.\nMedication side effects.\nStuttering may occur as a side effect of medication and may be\ndetected by a temporal relationship with exposure to the medication.\nAdult-onset dysfluencies.\nIf onset of dysfluencies is during or after adolescence, it is an\n“adult-onset dysfluency” rather than a neurodevelopmental disorder.

Persistent difficulties in the social use of verbal and nonverbal communication as man-\nifested by all of the following:\n1. Deficits in using communication for social purposes, such as greeting and sharing\ninformation, in a manner that is appropriate for the social context.\n2. Impairment of the ability to change communication to match context or the needs of\nthe listener, such as speaking differently in a classroom than on a playground, talk-\ning differently to a child than to an adult, and avoiding use of overly formal language.\n3.

Difficulties understanding what is not explicitly stated (e.g., making inferences) and\nnonliteral or ambiguous meanings of language (e.g., idioms, humor, metaphors,\nmultiple meanings that depend on the context for interpretation).\nB.

The onset of the symptoms is in the early developmental period (but deficits may not\nbecome fully manifest until social communication demands exceed limited capacities).\nD. The symptoms are not attributable to another medical or neurological condition or to low\nabilities in the domains of word structure and grammar, and are not better explained by\nautism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder),\nglobal developmental delay, or another mental disorder.\nDiagnostic Features\nSocial (pragmatic) communication disorder is characterized by a primary difficulty with\npragmatics, or the social use of language and communication, as manifested by deficits in\nunderstanding and following social rules of verbal and nonverbal communication in nat-\nuralistic contexts, changing language according to the needs of the listener or situation,\nand following rules for conversations and storytelling. The deficits in social communica-\ntion result in functional limitations in effective communication, social participation, devel-\nopment of social relationships, academic achievement, or occupational performance. The\ndeficits are not better explained by low abilities in the domains of structural language or\ncognitive ability.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nThe most common associated feature of social (pragmatic) communication disorder is lan-\nguage impairment, which is characterized by a history of delay in reaching language mile-\nstones, and historical, if not current, structural language problems (see “Language Disorder”\nearlier in this chapter). Individuals with social communication deficits may avoid social inter-\nactions. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), behavioral problems, and specific\nlearning disorders are also more common among affected individuals.\nDevelopment and Course \nBecause social (pragmatic) communication depends on adequate developmental progress\nin speech and language, diagnosis of social (pragmatic) communication disorder is rare\namong children younger than 4 years. By age 4 or 5 years, most children should possess\nadequate speech and language abilities to permit identification of specific deficits in social\ncommunication. Milder forms of the disorder may not become apparent until early ado-\nlescence, when language and social interactions become more complex.\nThe outcome of social (pragmatic) communication disorder is variable, with some chil-\ndren improving substantially over time and others continuing to have difficulties persist-\ning into adulthood. Even among those who have significant improvements, the early\ndeficits in pragmatics may cause lasting impairments in social relationships and behavior\nand also in acquisition of other related skills, such as written expression. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nGenetic and physiological.\nA family history of autism spectrum disorder, communica-\ntion disorders, or specific learning disorder appears to increase the risk for social (prag-\nmatic) communication disorder.\nUnspecified Communication Disorder\n49\nDifferential Diagnosis\nAutism spectrum disorder.\nAutism spectrum disorder is the primary diagnostic con-\nsideration for individuals presenting with social communication deficits. The two disor-\nders can be differentiated by the presence in autism spectrum disorder of restricted/\nrepetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities and their absence in social (prag-\nmatic) communication disorder. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder may only dis-\nplay the restricted/repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities during the early\ndevelopmental period, so a comprehensive history should be obtained. Current absence of\nsymptoms would not preclude a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, if the restricted\ninterests and repetitive behaviors were present in the past. A diagnosis of social (prag-\nmatic) communication disorder should be considered only if the developmental history\nfails to reveal any evidence of restricted/repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or ac-\ntivities.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nPrimary deficits of ADHD may cause impair-\nments in social communication and functional limitations of effective communication, so-\ncial participation, or academic achievement.\nSocial anxiety disorder (social phobia).\nThe symptoms of social communication disor-\nder overlap with those of social anxiety disorder. The differentiating feature is the timing\nof the onset of symptoms. In social (pragmatic) communication disorder, the individual\nhas never had effective social communication; in social anxiety disorder, the social com-\nmunication skills developed appropriately but are not utilized because of anxiety, fear, or\ndistress about social interactions.\nIntellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) and global developmental\ndelay.\nSocial communication skills may be deficient among individuals with global de-\nvelopmental delay or intellectual disability, but a separate diagnosis is not given unless\nthe social communication deficits are clearly in excess of the intellectual limitations.", "provenance": {"source_file": "neurodevelopmental_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 7, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.483383"}}

Severity should be\nrecorded as level of support needed for each of the two psychopathological domains in\nTable 2 (e.g., “requiring very substantial support for deficits in social communication and\nrequiring substantial support for restricted, repetitive behaviors”). Specification of “with\naccompanying intellectual impairment” or “without accompanying intellectual impair-\nment” should be recorded next. Language impairment specification should be recorded\nthereafter. If there is accompanying language impairment, the current level of verbal func-\ntioning should be recorded (e.g., “with accompanying language impairment—no intelligi-\nble speech” or “with accompanying language impairment—phrase speech”). If catatonia is\npresent, record separately “catatonia associated with autism spectrum disorder.”\nSpecifiers\nThe severity specifiers (see Table 2) may be used to describe succinctly the current symp-\ntomatology (which might fall below level 1), with the recognition that severity may vary by\ncontext and fluctuate over time. Severity of social communication difficulties and re-\nstricted, repetitive behaviors should be separately rated. The descriptive severity categories\nshould not be used to determine eligibility for and provision of services; these can only be\ndeveloped at an individual level and through discussion of personal priorities and targets.\nRegarding the specifier “with or without accompanying intellectual impairment,” un-\nderstanding the (often uneven) intellectual profile of a child or adult with autism spectrum\ndisorder is necessary for interpreting diagnostic features. Separate estimates of verbal and\nnonverbal skill are necessary (e.g., using untimed nonverbal tests to assess potential\nstrengths in individuals with limited language).\n52\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nTABLE 2 Severity levels for autism spectrum disorder\nSeverity level\nSocial communication\nRestricted, repetitive behaviors\nLevel 3 \n“Requiring very substantial support”\nSevere deficits in verbal and nonverbal social com-\nmunication skills cause severe impairments in func-\ntioning, very limited initiation of social \ninteractions, and minimal response to social over-\ntures from others. For example, a person with few \nwords of intelligible speech who rarely initiates \ninteraction and, when he or she does, makes \nunusual approaches to meet needs only and \nresponds to only very direct social approaches.\nInflexibility of behavior, extreme difficulty coping \nwith change, or other restricted/repetitive behav-\niors markedly interfere with functioning in all \nspheres. Great distress/difficulty changing focus \nor action.\nLevel 2\n“Requiring substantial support”\nMarked deficits in verbal and nonverbal social com-\nmunication skills; social impairments apparent \neven with supports in place; limited initiation of \nsocial interactions; and reduced or abnormal \nresponses to social overtures from others. For \nexample, a person who speaks simple sentences, \nwhose interaction is limited to narrow special inter-\nests, and who has markedly odd nonverbal com-\nmunication.\nInflexibility of behavior, difficulty coping with \nchange, or other restricted/repetitive behaviors \nappear frequently enough to be obvious to the \ncasual observer and interfere with functioning \nin a variety of contexts. Distress and/or difficulty \nchanging focus or action.\nLevel 1 \n“Requiring support”\nWithout supports in place, deficits in social communi-\ncation cause noticeable impairments.\nDifficulty initiating social interactions, and clear \nexamples of atypical or unsuccessful responses to \nsocial overtures of others.

For example, \na person who is able to speak in full sentences and \nengages in communication but whose to-and-fro con-\nversation with others fails, and whose attempts to \nmake friends are odd and typically unsuccessful.\nInflexibility of behavior causes significant interfer-\nence with functioning in one or more contexts. Dif-\nficulty switching between activities. Problems of \norganization and planning hamper independence.\nAutism Spectrum Disorder\n53\nTo use the specifier “with or without accompanying language impairment,” the cur-\nrent level of verbal functioning should be assessed and described. Examples of the specific\ndescriptions for “with accompanying language impairment” might include no intelligible\nspeech (nonverbal), single words only, or phrase speech. Language level in individuals\n“without accompanying language impairment” might be further described by speaks in\nfull sentences or has fluent speech. Since receptive language may lag behind expressive\nlanguage development in autism spectrum disorder, receptive and expressive language\nskills should be considered separately.\nThe specifier “associated with a known medical or genetic condition or environmental fac-\ntor” should be used when the individual has a known genetic disorder (e.g., Rett syndrome,\nFragile X syndrome, Down syndrome), a medical disorder (e.g. epilepsy), or a history of envi-\nronmental exposure (e.g., valproate, fetal alcohol syndrome, very low birth weight).\nAdditional neurodevelopmental, mental or behavioral conditions should also be noted\n(e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; developmental coordination disorder; dis-\nruptive behavior, impulse-control, or conduct disorders; anxiety, depressive, or bipolar\ndisorders; tics or Tourette’s disorder; self-injury; feeding, elimination, or sleep disorders).\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential features of autism spectrum disorder are persistent impairment in reciprocal\nsocial communication and social interaction (Criterion A), and restricted, repetitive pat-\nterns of behavior, interests, or activities (Criterion B). These symptoms are present from\nearly childhood and limit or impair everyday functioning (Criteria C and D). The stage at\nwhich functional impairment becomes obvious will vary according to characteristics of\nthe individual and his or her environment. Core diagnostic features are evident in the\ndevelopmental period, but intervention, compensation, and current supports may mask\ndifficulties in at least some contexts. Manifestations of the disorder also vary greatly de-\npending on the severity of the autistic condition, developmental level, and chronological age;\nhence, the term spectrum. Autism spectrum disorder encompasses disorders previously re-\nferred to as early infantile autism, childhood autism, Kanner’s autism, high-functioning\nautism, atypical autism, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, child-\nhood disintegrative disorder, and Asperger’s disorder.\nThe impairments in communication and social interaction specified in Criterion A are\npervasive and sustained. Diagnoses are most valid and reliable when based on multiple\nsources of information, including clinician’s observations, caregiver history, and, when\npossible, self-report. Verbal and nonverbal deficits in social communication have varying\nmanifestations, depending on the individual’s age, intellectual level, and language ability,\nas well as other factors such as treatment history and current support. Many individuals\nhave language deficits, ranging from complete lack of speech through language delays,\npoor comprehension of speech, echoed speech, or stilted and overly literal language. Even\nwhen formal language skills (e.g., vocabulary, grammar) are intact, the use of language for\nreciprocal social communication is impaired in autism spectrum disorder.\nDeficits in social-emotional reciprocity (i.e., the ability to engage with others and share\nthoughts and feelings) are clearly evident in young children with the disorder, who may\nshow little or no initiation of social interaction and no sharing of emotions, along with re-\nduced or absent imitation of others’ behavior. What language exists is often one-sided,\nlacking in social reciprocity, and used to request or label rather than to comment, share\nfeelings, or converse. In adults without intellectual disabilities or language delays, deficits\nin social-emotional reciprocity may be most apparent in difficulties processing and re-\nsponding to complex social cues (e.g., when and how to join a conversation, what not to\nsay). Adults who have developed compensation strategies for some social challenges still\nstruggle in novel or unsupported situations and suffer from the effort and anxiety of con-\nsciously calculating what is socially intuitive for most individuals.\n54\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nDeficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction are mani-\nfested by absent, reduced, or atypical use of eye contact (relative to cultural norms), ges-\ntures, facial expressions, body orientation, or speech intonation. An early feature of autism\nspectrum disorder is impaired joint attention as manifested by a lack of pointing, showing,\nor bringing objects to share interest with others, or failure to follow someone’s pointing or\neye gaze. Individuals may learn a few functional gestures, but their repertoire is smaller\nthan that of others, and they often fail to use expressive gestures spontaneously in com-\nmunication. Among adults with fluent language, the difficulty in coordinating nonverbal\ncommunication with speech may give the impression of odd, wooden, or exaggerated\n“body language” during interactions. Impairment may be relatively subtle within indi-\nvidual modes (e.g., someone may have relatively good eye contact when speaking) but\nnoticeable in poor integration of eye contact, gesture, body posture, prosody, and facial ex-\npression for social communication.\nDeficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships should be\njudged against norms for age, gender, and culture. There may be absent, reduced, or atyp-\nical social interest, manifested by rejection of others, passivity, or inappropriate ap-\nproaches that seem aggressive or disruptive. These difficulties are particularly evident in\nyoung children, in whom there is often a lack of shared social play and imagination (e.g.,\nage-appropriate flexible pretend play) and, later, insistence on playing by very fixed rules.\nOlder individuals may struggle to understand what behavior is considered appropriate in\none situation but not another (e.g., casual behavior during a job interview), or the different\nways that language may be used to communicate (e.g., irony, white lies). There may be an\napparent preference for solitary activities or for interacting with much younger or older\npeople. Frequently, there is a desire to establish friendships without a complete or realistic\nidea of what friendship entails (e.g., one-sided friendships or friendships based solely on\nshared special interests). Relationships with siblings, co-workers, and caregivers are also\nimportant to consider (in terms of reciprocity).\nAutism spectrum disorder is also defined by restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior,\ninterests, or activities (as specified in Criterion B), which show a range of manifestations\naccording to age and ability, intervention, and current supports. Stereotyped or repetitive\nbehaviors include simple motor stereotypies (e.g., hand flapping, finger flicking), repeti-\ntive use of objects (e.g., spinning coins, lining up toys), and repetitive speech (e.g., echola-\nlia, the delayed or immediate parroting of heard words; use of “you” when referring to\nself; stereotyped use of words, phrases, or prosodic patterns). Excessive adherence to rou-\ntines and restricted patterns of behavior may be manifest in resistance to change (e.g., dis-\ntress at apparently small changes, such as in packaging of a favorite food; insistence on\nadherence to rules; rigidity of thinking) or ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal be-\nhavior (e.g., repetitive questioning, pacing a perimeter). Highly restricted, fixated interests\nin autism spectrum disorder tend to be abnormal in intensity or focus (e.g., a toddler\nstrongly attached to a pan; a child preoccupied with vacuum cleaners; an adult spending\nhours writing out timetables). Some fascinations and routines may relate to apparent hy-\nper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input, manifested through extreme responses to specific\nsounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, fascination with lights or\nspinning objects, and sometimes apparent indifference to pain, heat, or cold. Extreme re-\naction to or rituals involving taste, smell, texture, or appearance of food or excessive food\nrestrictions are common and may be a presenting feature of autism spectrum disorder.\nMany adults with autism spectrum disorder without intellectual or language disabili-\nties learn to suppress repetitive behavior in public. Special interests may be a source of\npleasure and motivation and provide avenues for education and employment later in life.\nDiagnostic criteria may be met when restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests,\nor activities were clearly present during childhood or at some time in the past, even if\nsymptoms are no longer present.\nAutism Spectrum Disorder\n55\nCriterion D requires that the features must cause clinically significant impairment in so-\ncial, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning. Criterion E specifies that\nthe social communication deficits, although sometimes accompanied by intellectual disabil-\nity (intellectual developmental disorder), are not in line with the individual’s developmental\nlevel; impairments exceed difficulties expected on the basis of developmental level.\nStandardized behavioral diagnostic instruments with good psychometric properties,\nincluding caregiver interviews, questionnaires and clinician observation measures, are\navailable and can improve reliability of diagnosis over time and across clinicians.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nMany individuals with autism spectrum disorder also have intellectual impairment and/or\nlanguage impairment (e.g., slow to talk, language comprehension behind production). Even\nthose with average or high intelligence have an uneven profile of abilities. The gap between\nintellectual and adaptive functional skills is often large. Motor deficits are often present, in-\ncluding odd gait, clumsiness, and other abnormal motor signs (e.g., walking on tiptoes). Self-\ninjury (e.g., head banging, biting the wrist) may occur, and disruptive/challenging behav-\niors are more common in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder than\nother disorders, including intellectual disability. Adolescents and adults with autism spec-\ntrum disorder are prone to anxiety and depression. Some individuals develop catatonic-like\nmotor behavior (slowing and “freezing” mid-action), but these are typically not of the mag-\nnitude of a catatonic episode. However, it is possible for individuals with autism spectrum\ndisorder to experience a marked deterioration in motor symptoms and display a full cata-\ntonic episode with symptoms such as mutism, posturing, grimacing and waxy flexibility.\nThe risk period for comorbid catatonia appears to be greatest in the adolescent years.\nPrevalence \nIn recent years, reported frequencies for autism spectrum disorder across U.S. and non-\nU.S. countries have approached 1% of the population, with similar estimates in child and\nadult samples. It remains unclear whether higher rates reflect an expansion of the diag-\nnostic criteria of DSM-IV to include subthreshold cases, increased awareness, differences\nin study methodology, or a true increase in the frequency of autism spectrum disorder.\nDevelopment and Course\nThe age and pattern of onset also should be noted for autism spectrum disorder. Symptoms\nare typically recognized during the second year of life (12–24 months of age) but may be seen\nearlier than 12 months if developmental delays are severe, or noted later than 24 months if\nsymptoms are more subtle. The pattern of onset description might include information\nabout early developmental delays or any losses of social or language skills. In cases where\nskills have been lost, parents or caregivers may give a history of a gradual or relatively\nrapid deterioration in social behaviors or language skills. Typically, this would occur be-\ntween 12 and 24 months of age and is distinguished from the rare instances of developmen-\ntal regression occurring after at least 2 years of normal development (previously described\nas childhood disintegrative disorder).\nThe behavioral features of autism spectrum disorder first become evident in early\nchildhood, with some cases presenting a lack of interest in social interaction in the first\nyear of life. Some children with autism spectrum disorder experience developmental pla-\nteaus or regression, with a gradual or relatively rapid deterioration in social behaviors or\nuse of language, often during the first 2 years of life. Such losses are rare in other disor-\nders and may be a useful “red flag” for autism spectrum disorder. Much more unusual\nand warranting more extensive medical investigation are losses of skills beyond social\ncommunication (e.g., loss of self-care, toileting, motor skills) or those occurring after the\n56\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nsecond birthday (see also Rett syndrome in the section “Differential Diagnosis” for this\ndisorder).\nFirst symptoms of autism spectrum disorder frequently involve delayed language de-\nvelopment, often accompanied by lack of social interest or unusual social interactions (e.g.,\npulling individuals by the hand without any attempt to look at them), odd play patterns\n(e.g., carrying toys around but never playing with them), and unusual communication\npatterns (e.g., knowing the alphabet but not responding to own name). Deafness may be\nsuspected but is typically ruled out. During the second year, odd and repetitive behaviors\nand the absence of typical play become more apparent. Since many typically developing\nyoung children have strong preferences and enjoy repetition (e.g., eating the same foods,\nwatching the same video multiple times), distinguishing restricted and repetitive behav-\niors that are diagnostic of autism spectrum disorder can be difficult in preschoolers. The\nclinical distinction is based on the type, frequency, and intensity of the behavior (e.g., a\nchild who daily lines up objects for hours and is very distressed if any item is moved).\nAutism spectrum disorder is not a degenerative disorder, and it is typical for learning\nand compensation to continue throughout life. Symptoms are often most marked in early\nchildhood and early school years, with developmental gains typical in later childhood in\nat least some areas (e.g., increased interest in social interaction). A small proportion of in-\ndividuals deteriorate behaviorally during adolescence, whereas most others improve.\nOnly a minority of individuals with autism spectrum disorder live and work indepen-\ndently in adulthood; those who do tend to have superior language and intellectual abilities\nand are able to find a niche that matches their special interests and skills. In general, indi-\nviduals with lower levels of impairment may be better able to function independently.\nHowever, even these individuals may remain socially naive and vulnerable, have difficul-\nties organizing practical demands without aid, and are prone to anxiety and depression.\nMany adults report using compensation strategies and coping mechanisms to mask their\ndifficulties in public but suffer from the stress and effort of maintaining a socially accept-\nable facade. Scarcely anything is known about old age in autism spectrum disorder.\nSome individuals come for first diagnosis in adulthood, perhaps prompted by the diagno-\nsis of autism in a child in the family or a breakdown of relations at work or home. Obtaining de-\ntailed developmental history in such cases may be difficult, and it is important to consider self-\nreported difficulties. Where clinical observation suggests criteria are currently met, autism\nspectrum disorder may be diagnosed, provided there is no evidence of good social and com-\nmunication skills in childhood. For example, the report (by parents or another relative) that the\nindividual had ordinary and sustained reciprocal friendships and good nonverbal communi-\ncation skills throughout childhood would rule out a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder;\nhowever, the absence of developmental information in itself should not do so.\nManifestations of the social and communication impairments and restricted/repeti-\ntive behaviors that define autism spectrum disorder are clear in the developmental period.\nIn later life, intervention or compensation, as well as current supports, may mask these dif-\nficulties in at least some contexts. However, symptoms remain sufficient to cause current\nimpairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nThe best established prognostic factors for individual outcome within autism spectrum\ndisorder are presence or absence of associated intellectual disability and language impair-\nment (e.g., functional language by age 5 years is a good prognostic sign) and additional\nmental health problems. Epilepsy, as a comorbid diagnosis, is associated with greater in-\ntellectual disability and lower verbal ability.\nEnvironmental.\nA variety of nonspecific risk factors, such as advanced parental age, low\nbirth weight, or fetal exposure to valproate, may contribute to risk of autism spectrum dis-\norder.\nAutism Spectrum Disorder\n57\nGenetic and physiological.\nHeritability estimates for autism spectrum disorder have\nranged from 37% to higher than 90%, based on twin concordance rates. Currently, as many\nas 15% of cases of autism spectrum disorder appear to be associated with a known genetic\nmutation, with different de novo copy number variants or de novo mutations in specific\ngenes associated with the disorder in different families. However, even when an autism\nspectrum disorder is associated with a known genetic mutation, it does not appear to be\nfully penetrant. Risk for the remainder of cases appears to be polygenic, with perhaps hun-\ndreds of genetic loci making relatively small contributions.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues \nCultural differences will exist in norms for social interaction, nonverbal communication,\nand relationships, but individuals with autism spectrum disorder are markedly impaired\nagainst the norms for their cultural context. Cultural and socioeconomic factors may affect\nage at recognition or diagnosis; for example, in the United States, late or underdiagnosis of\nautism spectrum disorder among African American children may occur.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nAutism spectrum disorder is diagnosed four times more often in males than in females. In\nclinic samples, females tend to be more likely to show accompanying intellectual disabil-\nity, suggesting that girls without accompanying intellectual impairments or language\ndelays may go unrecognized, perhaps because of subtler manifestation of social and com-\nmunication difficulties.\nFunctional Consequences of Autism Spectrum Disorder\nIn young children with autism spectrum disorder, lack of social and communication abil-\nities may hamper learning, especially learning through social interaction or in settings\nwith peers. In the home, insistence on routines and aversion to change, as well as sensory\nsensitivities, may interfere with eating and sleeping and make routine care (e.g., haircuts,\ndental work) extremely difficult. Adaptive skills are typically below measured IQ. Ex-\ntreme difficulties in planning, organization, and coping with change negatively impact\nacademic achievement, even for students with above-average intelligence. During adult-\nhood, these individuals may have difficulties establishing independence because of con-\ntinued rigidity and difficulty with novelty.\nMany individuals with autism spectrum disorder, even without intellectual disability,\nhave poor adult psychosocial functioning as indexed by measures such as independent\nliving and gainful employment. Functional consequences in old age are unknown, but so-\ncial isolation and communication problems (e.g., reduced help-seeking) are likely to have\nconsequences for health in older adulthood.\nDifferential Diagnosis \nRett syndrome.\nDisruption of social interaction may be observed during the regressive\nphase of Rett syndrome (typically between 1–4 years of age); thus, a substantial proportion\nof affected young girls may have a presentation that meets diagnostic criteria for autism\nspectrum disorder. However, after this period, most individuals with Rett syndrome im-\nprove their social communication skills, and autistic features are no longer a major area of\nconcern. Consequently, autism spectrum disorder should be considered only when all di-\nagnostic criteria are met.\nSelective mutism.\nIn selective mutism, early development is not typically disturbed.\nThe affected child usually exhibits appropriate communication skills in certain contexts\nand settings. Even in settings where the child is mute, social reciprocity is not impaired,\nnor are restricted or repetitive patterns of behavior present.\n58\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nLanguage disorders and social (pragmatic) communication disorder.\nIn some forms\nof language disorder, there may be problems of communication and some secondary so-\ncial difficulties. However, specific language disorder is not usually associated with abnor-\nmal nonverbal communication, nor with the presence of restricted, repetitive patterns of\nbehavior, interests, or activities.\nWhen an individual shows impairment in social communication and social interactions\nbut does not show restricted and repetitive behavior or interests, criteria for social (prag-\nmatic) communication disorder, instead of autism spectrum disorder, may be met. The di-\nagnosis of autism spectrum disorder supersedes that of social (pragmatic) communication\ndisorder whenever the criteria for autism spectrum disorder are met, and care should be\ntaken to enquire carefully regarding past or current restricted/repetitive behavior.\nIntellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) without autism spectrum\ndisorder.\nIntellectual disability without autism spectrum disorder may be difficult to\ndifferentiate from autism spectrum disorder in very young children. Individuals with in-\ntellectual disability who have not developed language or symbolic skills also present a\nchallenge for differential diagnosis, since repetitive behavior often occurs in such individ-\nuals as well. A diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in an individual with intellectual\ndisability is appropriate when social communication and interaction are significantly im-\npaired relative to the developmental level of the individual’s nonverbal skills (e.g., fine\nmotor skills, nonverbal problem solving). In contrast, intellectual disability is the appropri-\nate diagnosis when there is no apparent discrepancy between the level of social-commu-\nnicative skills and other intellectual skills.\nStereotypic movement disorder.\nMotor stereotypies are among the diagnostic charac-\nteristics of autism spectrum disorder, so an additional diagnosis of stereotypic movement\ndisorder is not given when such repetitive behaviors are better explained by the presence\nof autism spectrum disorder. However, when stereotypies cause self-injury and become a\nfocus of treatment, both diagnoses may be appropriate.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nAbnormalities of attention (overly focused or\neasily distracted) are common in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, as is hy-\nperactivity. A diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) should be\nconsidered when attentional difficulties or hyperactivity exceeds that typically seen in in-\ndividuals of comparable mental age.\nSchizophrenia.\nSchizophrenia with childhood onset usually develops after a period of\nnormal, or near normal, development. A prodromal state has been described in which so-\ncial impairment and atypical interests and beliefs occur, which could be confused with the\nsocial deficits seen in autism spectrum disorder. Hallucinations and delusions, which are\ndefining features of schizophrenia, are not features of autism spectrum disorder. How-\never, clinicians must take into account the potential for individuals with autism spectrum\ndisorder to be concrete in their interpretation of questions regarding the key features of\nschizophrenia (e.g., “Do you hear voices when no one is there?” ”Yes [on the radio]”).\nComorbidity\nAutism spectrum disorder is frequently associated with intellectual impairment and struc-\ntural language disorder (i.e., an inability to comprehend and construct sentences with proper\ngrammar), which should be noted under the relevant specifiers when applicable. Many in-\ndividuals with autism spectrum disorder have psychiatric symptoms that do not form part of\nthe diagnostic criteria for the disorder (about 70% of individuals with autism spectrum dis-\norder may have one comorbid mental disorder, and 40% may have two or more comorbid\nmental disorders). When criteria for both ADHD and autism spectrum disorder are met, both\ndiagnoses should be given. This same principle applies to concurrent diagnoses of autism\nspectrum disorder and developmental coordination disorder, anxiety disorders, depressive\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder\n59\ndisorders, and other comorbid diagnoses. Among individuals who are nonverbal or have\nlanguage deficits, observable signs such as changes in sleep or eating and increases in chal-\nlenging behavior should trigger an evaluation for anxiety or depression. Specific learning dif-\nficulties (literacy and numeracy) are common, as is developmental coordination disorder.\nMedical conditions commonly associated with autism spectrum disorder should be noted\nunder the “associated with a known medical/genetic or environmental/acquired condition”\nspecifier. Such medical conditions include epilepsy, sleep problems, and constipation.\nAvoidant-restrictive food intake disorder is a fairly frequent presenting feature of autism\nspectrum disorder, and extreme and narrow food preferences may persist. \nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity \nDisorder", "provenance": {"source_file": "neurodevelopmental_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 9, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.483383"}}

Inattention manifests behaviorally in ADHD as wandering off task, lacking\npersistence, having difficulty sustaining focus, and being disorganized and is not due to\ndefiance or lack of comprehension. Hyperactivity refers to excessive motor activity (such as\na child running about) when it is not appropriate, or excessive fidgeting, tapping, or talk-\nativeness. In adults, hyperactivity may manifest as extreme restlessness or wearing others\nout with their activity. Impulsivity refers to hasty actions that occur in the moment without\nforethought and that have high potential for harm to the individual (e.g., darting into the\nstreet without looking). Impulsivity may reflect a desire for immediate rewards or an in-\nability to delay gratification. Impulsive behaviors may manifest as social intrusiveness\n(e.g., interrupting others excessively) and/or as making important decisions without con-\nsideration of long-term consequences (e.g., taking a job without adequate information).\nADHD begins in childhood. The requirement that several symptoms be present before\nage 12 years conveys the importance of a substantial clinical presentation during child-\nhood. At the same time, an earlier age at onset is not specified because of difficulties in es-\ntablishing precise childhood onset retrospectively. Adult recall of childhood symptoms\ntends to be unreliable, and it is beneficial to obtain ancillary information.\nManifestations of the disorder must be present in more than one setting (e.g., home and\nschool, work). Confirmation of substantial symptoms across settings typically cannot be\ndone accurately without consulting informants who have seen the individual in those set-\ntings. Typically, symptoms vary depending on context within a given setting. Signs of the\ndisorder may be minimal or absent when the individual is receiving frequent rewards for\nappropriate behavior, is under close supervision, is in a novel setting, is engaged in espe-\ncially interesting activities, has consistent external stimulation (e.g., via electronic screens),\nor is interacting in one-on-one situations (e.g., the clinician's office).\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nMild delays in language, motor, or social development are not specific to ADHD but often co-\noccur. Associated features may include low frustration tolerance, irritability, or mood lability.\nEven in the absence of a specific learning disorder, academic or work performance is often im-\npaired. Inattentive behavior is associated with various underlying cognitive processes, and in-\ndividuals with ADHD may exhibit cognitive problems on tests of attention, executive\nfunction, or memory, although these tests are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to serve as di-\nagnostic indices. By early adulthood, ADHD is associated with an increased risk of suicide at-\ntempt, primarily when comorbid with mood, conduct, or substance use disorders.\nNo biological marker is diagnostic for ADHD. As a group, compared with peers, chil-\ndren with ADHD display increased slow wave electroencephalograms, reduced total\nbrain volume on magnetic resonance imaging, and possibly a delay in posterior to anterior\ncortical maturation, but these findings are not diagnostic. In the uncommon cases where\nthere is a known genetic cause (e.g., Fragile X syndrome, 22q11 deletion syndrome), the\nADHD presentation should still be diagnosed.\nPrevalence\nPopulation surveys suggest that ADHD occurs in most cultures in about 5% of children\nand about 2.5% of adults.\n62\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nDevelopment and Course\nMany parents first observe excessive motor activity when the child is a toddler, but symp-\ntoms are difficult to distinguish from highly variable normative behaviors before age 4\nyears. ADHD is most often identified during elementary school years, and inattention be-\ncomes more prominent and impairing. The disorder is relatively stable through early ad-\nolescence, but some individuals have a worsened course with development of antisocial\nbehaviors. In most individuals with ADHD, symptoms of motoric hyperactivity become\nless obvious in adolescence and adulthood, but difficulties with restlessness, inattention,\npoor planning, and impulsivity persist. A substantial proportion of children with ADHD\nremain relatively impaired into adulthood.\nIn preschool, the main manifestation is hyperactivity. Inattention becomes more prom-\ninent during elementary school. During adolescence, signs of hyperactivity (e.g., running\nand climbing) are less common and may be confined to fidgetiness or an inner feeling of\njitteriness, restlessness, or impatience. In adulthood, along with inattention and restless-\nness, impulsivity may remain problematic even when hyperactivity has diminished.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nTemperamental.\nADHD is associated with reduced behavioral inhibition, effortful con-\ntrol, or constraint; negative emotionality; and/or elevated novelty seeking. These traits\nmay predispose some children to ADHD but are not specific to the disorder.\nEnvironmental.\nVery low birth weight (less than 1,500 grams) conveys a two- to three-\nfold risk for ADHD, but most children with low birth weight do not develop ADHD. Al-\nthough ADHD is correlated with smoking during pregnancy, some of this association\nreflects common genetic risk. A minority of cases may be related to reactions to aspects of\ndiet. There may be a history of child abuse, neglect, multiple foster placements, neurotoxin\nexposure (e.g., lead), infections (e.g., encephalitis), or alcohol exposure in utero. Exposure\nto environmental toxicants has been correlated with subsequent ADHD, but it is not\nknown whether these associations are causal.\nGenetic and physiological.\nADHD is elevated in the first-degree biological relatives of\nindividuals with ADHD. The heritability of ADHD is substantial. While specific genes\nhave been correlated with ADHD, they are neither necessary nor sufficient causal factors.\nVisual and hearing impairments, metabolic abnormalities, sleep disorders, nutritional de-\nficiencies, and epilepsy should be considered as possible influences on ADHD symptoms.\nADHD is not associated with specific physical features, although rates of minor phys-\nical anomalies (e.g., hypertelorism, highly arched palate, low-set ears) may be relatively\nelevated. Subtle motor delays and other neurological soft signs may occur. (Note that\nmarked co-occurring clumsiness and motor delays should be coded separately [e.g., de-\nvelopmental coordination disorder].)\nCourse modifiers.\nFamily interaction patterns in early childhood are unlikely to cause\nADHD but may influence its course or contribute to secondary development of conduct\nproblems.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nDifferences in ADHD prevalence rates across regions appear attributable mainly to differ-\nent diagnostic and methodological practices. However, there also may be cultural varia-\ntion in attitudes toward or interpretations of children’s behaviors. Clinical identification\nrates in the United States for African American and Latino populations tend to be lower\nthan for Caucasian populations. Informant symptom ratings may be influenced by cul-\ntural group of the child and the informant, suggesting that culturally appropriate practices\nare relevant in assessing ADHD.\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder\n63\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nADHD is more frequent in males than in females in the general population, with a ratio of\napproximately 2:1 in children and 1.6:1 in adults. Females are more likely than males to\npresent primarily with inattentive features.\nFunctional Consequences of \nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder\nADHD is associated with reduced school performance and academic attainment, social re-\njection, and, in adults, poorer occupational performance, attainment, attendance, and\nhigher probability of unemployment as well as elevated interpersonal conflict. Children\nwith ADHD are significantly more likely than their peers without ADHD to develop con-\nduct disorder in adolescence and antisocial personality disorder in adulthood, conse-\nquently increasing the likelihood for substance use disorders and incarceration. The risk of\nsubsequent substance use disorders is elevated, especially when conduct disorder or an-\ntisocial personality disorder develops. Individuals with ADHD are more likely than peers\nto be injured. Traffic accidents and violations are more frequent in drivers with ADHD.\nThere may be an elevated likelihood of obesity among individuals with ADHD.\nInadequate or variable self-application to tasks that require sustained effort is often in-\nterpreted by others as laziness, irresponsibility, or failure to cooperate. Family relation-\nships may be characterized by discord and negative interactions. Peer relationships are\noften disrupted by peer rejection, neglect, or teasing of the individual with ADHD. On av-\nerage, individuals with ADHD obtain less schooling, have poorer vocational achievement,\nand have reduced intellectual scores than their peers, although there is great variability. In\nits severe form, the disorder is markedly impairing, affecting social, familial, and scholas-\ntic/occupational adjustment.\nAcademic deficits, school-related problems, and peer neglect tend to be most associ-\nated with elevated symptoms of inattention, whereas peer rejection and, to a lesser extent,\naccidental injury are most salient with marked symptoms of hyperactivity or impulsivity.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nOppositional defiant disorder.\nIndividuals with oppositional defiant disorder may re-\nsist work or school tasks that require self-application because they resist conforming to\nothers' demands. Their behavior is characterized by negativity, hostility, and defiance.\nThese symptoms must be differentiated from aversion to school or mentally demanding\ntasks due to difficulty in sustaining mental effort, forgetting instructions, and impulsivity\nin individuals with ADHD. Complicating the differential diagnosis is the fact that some\nindividuals with ADHD may develop secondary oppositional attitudes toward such tasks\nand devalue their importance.\nIntermittent explosive disorder.\nADHD and intermittent explosive disorder share high\nlevels of impulsive behavior. However, individuals with intermittent explosive disorder\nshow serious aggression toward others, which is not characteristic of ADHD, and they do\nnot experience problems with sustaining attention as seen in ADHD. In addition, intermit-\ntent explosive disorder is rare in childhood. Intermittent explosive disorder may be diag-\nnosed in the presence of ADHD.\nOther neurodevelopmental disorders.\nThe increased motoric activity that may occur in\nADHD must be distinguished from the repetitive motor behavior that characterizes stereo-\ntypic movement disorder and some cases of autism spectrum disorder. In stereotypic\nmovement disorder, the motoric behavior is generally fixed and repetitive (e.g., body rock-\ning, self-biting), whereas the fidgetiness and restlessness in ADHD are typically general-\nized and not characterized by repetitive stereotypic movements. In Tourette’s disorder,\n64\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nfrequent multiple tics can be mistaken for the generalized fidgetiness of ADHD. Prolonged\nobservation may be needed to differentiate fidgetiness from bouts of multiple tics.\nSpecific learning disorder.\nChildren with specific learning disorder may appear inat-\ntentive because of frustration, lack of interest, or limited ability. However, inattention in\nindividuals with a specific learning disorder who do not have ADHD is not impairing out-\nside of academic work.\nIntellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).\nSymptoms of ADHD are\ncommon among children placed in academic settings that are inappropriate to their intel-\nlectual ability. In such cases, the symptoms are not evident during non-academic tasks. A\ndiagnosis of ADHD in intellectual disability requires that inattention or hyperactivity be\nexcessive for mental age.\nAutism spectrum disorder.\nIndividuals with ADHD and those with autism spectrum\ndisorder exhibit inattention, social dysfunction, and difficult-to-manage behavior. The so-\ncial dysfunction and peer rejection seen in individuals with ADHD must be distinguished\nfrom the social disengagement, isolation, and indifference to facial and tonal communica-\ntion cues seen in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Children with autism spec-\ntrum disorder may display tantrums because of an inability to tolerate a change from their\nexpected course of events. In contrast, children with ADHD may misbehave or have a tan-\ntrum during a major transition because of impulsivity or poor self-control.\nReactive attachment disorder.\nChildren with reactive attachment disorder may show\nsocial disinhibition, but not the full ADHD symptom cluster, and display other features\nsuch as a lack of enduring relationships that are not characteristic of ADHD.\nAnxiety disorders.\nADHD shares symptoms of inattention with anxiety disorders. Indi-\nviduals with ADHD are inattentive because of their attraction to external stimuli, new\nactivities, or preoccupation with enjoyable activities. This is distinguished from the inat-\ntention due to worry and rumination seen in anxiety disorders. Restlessness might be seen\nin anxiety disorders. However, in ADHD, the symptom is not associated with worry and\nrumination.\nDepressive disorders.\nIndividuals with depressive disorders may present with inabil-\nity to concentrate. However, poor concentration in mood disorders becomes prominent\nonly during a depressive episode.\nBipolar disorder.\nIndividuals with bipolar disorder may have increased activity, poor\nconcentration, and increased impulsivity, but these features are episodic, occurring sev-\neral days at a time. In bipolar disorder, increased impulsivity or inattention is accompa-\nnied by elevated mood, grandiosity, and other specific bipolar features. Children with\nADHD may show significant changes in mood within the same day; such lability is dis-\ntinct from a manic episode, which must last 4 or more days to be a clinical indicator of bi-\npolar disorder, even in children. Bipolar disorder is rare in preadolescents, even when\nsevere irritability and anger are prominent, whereas ADHD is common among children\nand adolescents who display excessive anger and irritability.\nDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder.\nDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder is\ncharacterized by pervasive irritability, and intolerance of frustration, but impulsiveness\nand disorganized attention are not essential features. However, most children and adoles-\ncents with the disorder have symptoms that also meet criteria for ADHD, which is diag-\nnosed separately.\nSubstance use disorders.\nDifferentiating ADHD from substance use disorders may be\nproblematic if the first presentation of ADHD symptoms follows the onset of abuse or fre-\nquent use. Clear evidence of ADHD before substance misuse from informants or previous\nrecords may be essential for differential diagnosis.\nOther Specified Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder\n65\nPersonality disorders.\nIn adolescents and adults, it may be difficult to distinguish ADHD\nfrom borderline, narcissistic, and other personality disorders. All these disorders tend to\nshare the features of disorganization, social intrusiveness, emotional dysregulation, and\ncognitive dysregulation. However, ADHD is not characterized by fear of abandonment,\nself-injury, extreme ambivalence, or other features of personality disorder. It may take\nextended clinical observation, informant interview, or detailed history to distinguish im-\npulsive, socially intrusive, or inappropriate behavior from narcissistic, aggressive, or dom-\nineering behavior to make this differential diagnosis.\nPsychotic disorders.\nADHD is not diagnosed if the symptoms of inattention and hyperac-\ntivity occur exclusively during the course of a psychotic disorder.\nMedication-induced symptoms of ADHD.\nSymptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or\nimpulsivity attributable to the use of medication (e.g., bronchodilators, isoniazid, neuro-\nleptics [resulting in akathisia], thyroid replacement medication) are diagnosed as other\nspecified or unspecified other (or unknown) substance–related disorders.\nNeurocognitive disorders.\nEarly major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) and/or\nmild neurocognitive disorder are not known to be associated with ADHD but may present\nwith similar clinical features. These conditions are distinguished from ADHD by their late\nonset.\nComorbidity\nIn clinical settings, comorbid disorders are frequent in individuals whose symptoms meet\ncriteria for ADHD. In the general population, oppositional defiant disorder co-occurs with\nADHD in approximately half of children with the combined presentation and about a\nquarter with the predominantly inattentive presentation. Conduct disorder co-occurs in\nabout a quarter of children or adolescents with the combined presentation, depending on\nage and setting. Most children and adolescents with disruptive mood dysregulation dis-\norder have symptoms that also meet criteria for ADHD; a lesser percentage of children\nwith ADHD have symptoms that meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disor-\nder. Specific learning disorder commonly co-occurs with ADHD. Anxiety disorders and\nmajor depressive disorder occur in a minority of individuals with ADHD but more often\nthan in the general population. Intermittent explosive disorder occurs in a minority of\nadults with ADHD, but at rates above population levels. Although substance use disor-\nders are relatively more frequent among adults with ADHD in the general population, the\ndisorders are present in only a minority of adults with ADHD. In adults, antisocial and\nother personality disorders may co-occur with ADHD. Other disorders that may co-occur\nwith ADHD include obsessive-compulsive disorder, tic disorders, and autism spectrum\ndisorder.", "provenance": {"source_file": "neurodevelopmental_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 10, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.483383"}}

Difficulties learning and using academic skills, as indicated by the presence of at least\none of the following symptoms that have persisted for at least 6 months, despite the\nprovision of interventions that target those difficulties:\n1. Inaccurate or slow and effortful word reading (e.g., reads single words aloud incor-\nrectly or slowly and hesitantly, frequently guesses words, has difficulty sounding\nout words).\n2. Difficulty understanding the meaning of what is read (e.g., may read text accurately\nbut not understand the sequence, relationships, inferences, or deeper meanings of\nwhat is read).\n3. Difficulties with spelling (e.g., may add, omit, or substitute vowels or consonants).\n4. Difficulties with written expression (e.g., makes multiple grammatical or punctua-\ntion errors within sentences; employs poor paragraph organization; written expres-\nsion of ideas lacks clarity).\n5. Difficulties mastering number sense, number facts, or calculation (e.g., has poor\nunderstanding of numbers, their magnitude, and relationships; counts on fingers to\nadd single-digit numbers instead of recalling the math fact as peers do; gets lost in\nthe midst of arithmetic computation and may switch procedures).\n6. Difficulties with mathematical reasoning (e.g., has severe difficulty applying math-\nematical concepts, facts, or procedures to solve quantitative problems).\nSpecific Learning Disorder\n67\nB. The affected academic skills are substantially and quantifiably below those expected\nfor the individual’s chronological age, and cause significant interference with academic\nor occupational performance, or with activities of daily living, as confirmed by individu-\nally administered standardized achievement measures and comprehensive clinical\nassessment. For individuals age 17 years and older, a documented history of impairing\nlearning difficulties may be substituted for the standardized assessment.\nC. The learning difficulties begin during school-age years but may not become fully man-\nifest until the demands for those affected academic skills exceed the individual’s lim-\nited capacities (e.g., as in timed tests, reading or writing lengthy complex reports for a\ntight deadline, excessively heavy academic loads).\nD. The learning difficulties are not better accounted for by intellectual disabilities, uncor-\nrected visual or auditory acuity, other mental or neurological disorders, psychosocial\nadversity, lack of proficiency in the language of academic instruction, or inadequate\neducational instruction.\nNote: The four diagnostic criteria are to be met based on a clinical synthesis of the indi-\nvidual’s history (developmental, medical, family, educational), school reports, and psycho-\neducational assessment.\nCoding note: Specify all academic domains and subskills that are impaired. When more\nthan one domain is impaired, each one should be coded individually according to the fol-\nlowing specifiers.\nSpecify if:\n315.00 (F81.0) With impairment in reading:\nWord reading accuracy\nReading rate or fluency\nReading comprehension\nNote: Dyslexia is an alternative term used to refer to a pattern of learning difficulties\ncharacterized by problems with accurate or fluent word recognition, poor decoding,\nand poor spelling abilities. If dyslexia is used to specify this particular pattern of dif-\nficulties, it is important also to specify any additional difficulties that are present,\nsuch as difficulties with reading comprehension or math reasoning.\n315.2 (F81.81) With impairment in written expression:\nSpelling accuracy\nGrammar and punctuation accuracy\nClarity or organization of written expression\n315.1 (F81.2) With impairment in mathematics:\nNumber sense\nMemorization of arithmetic facts\nAccurate or fluent calculation\nAccurate math reasoning\nNote: Dyscalculia is an alternative term used to refer to a pattern of difficulties char-\nacterized by problems processing numerical information, learning arithmetic facts,\nand performing accurate or fluent calculations. If dyscalculia is used to specify this\nparticular pattern of mathematic difficulties, it is important also to specify any addi-\ntional difficulties that are present, such as difficulties with math reasoning or word rea-\nsoning accuracy.\nSpecify current severity:\nMild: Some difficulties learning skills in one or two academic domains, but of mild enough\nseverity that the individual may be able to compensate or function well when provided with\nappropriate accommodations or support services, especially during the school years.\n68\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nModerate: Marked difficulties learning skills in one or more academic domains, so that\nthe individual is unlikely to become proficient without some intervals of intensive and\nspecialized teaching during the school years. Some accommodations or supportive\nservices at least part of the day at school, in the workplace, or at home may be needed\nto complete activities accurately and efficiently.\nSevere: Severe difficulties learning skills, affecting several academic domains, so that\nthe individual is unlikely to learn those skills without ongoing intensive individualized\nand specialized teaching for most of the school years. Even with an array of appropri-\nate accommodations or services at home, at school, or in the workplace, the individual\nmay not be able to complete all activities efficiently.\nRecording Procedures\nEach impaired academic domain and subskill of specific learning disorder should be re-\ncorded. Because of ICD coding requirements, impairments in reading, impairments in writ-\nten expression, and impairments in mathematics, with their corresponding impairments in\nsubskills, must be coded separately. For example, impairments in reading and mathematics\nand impairments in the subskills of reading rate or fluency, reading comprehension, accu-\nrate or fluent calculation, and accurate math reasoning would be coded and recorded as\n315.00 (F81.0) specific learning disorder with impairment in reading, with impairment in\nreading rate or fluency and impairment in reading comprehension; 315.1 (F81.2) specific\nlearning disorder with impairment in mathematics, with impairment in accurate or fluent\ncalculation and impairment in accurate math reasoning.\nDiagnostic Features\nSpecific learning disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a biological origin that is\nthe basis for abnormalities at a cognitive level that are associated with the behavioral signs\nof the disorder. The biological origin includes an interaction of genetic, epigenetic, and en-\nvironmental factors, which affect the brain’s ability to perceive or process verbal or non-\nverbal information efficiently and accurately.\nOne essential feature of specific learning disorder is persistent difficulties learning key-\nstone academic skills (Criterion A), with onset during the years of formal schooling (i.e., the de-\nvelopmental period). Key academic skills include reading of single words accurately and\nfluently, reading comprehension, written expression and spelling, arithmetic calculation, and\nmathematical reasoning (solving mathematical problems). In contrast to talking or walking,\nwhich are acquired developmental milestones that emerge with brain maturation, academic\nskills (e.g., reading, spelling, writing, mathematics) have to be taught and learned explicitly.\nSpecific learning disorder disrupts the normal pattern of learning academic skills; it is not sim-\nply a consequence of lack of opportunity of learning or inadequate instruction. Difficulties\nmastering these key academic skills may also impede learning in other academic subjects (e.g.,\nhistory, science, social studies), but those problems are attributable to difficulties learning the\nunderlying academic skills. Difficulties learning to map letters with the sounds of one’s lan-\nguage—to read printed words (often called dyslexia)—is one of the most common manifesta-\ntions of specific learning disorder. The learning difficulties manifest as a range of observable,\ndescriptive behaviors or symptoms (as listed in Criteria A1–A6). These clinical symptoms may\nbe observed, probed by means of the clinical interview, or ascertained from school reports, rat-\ning scales, or descriptions in previous educational or psychological assessments. The learning\ndifficulties are persistent, not transitory. In children and adolescents, persistence is defined as\nrestricted progress in learning (i.e., no evidence that the individual is catching up with class-\nmates) for at least 6 months despite the provision of extra help at home or school. For example,\ndifficulties learning to read single words that do not fully or rapidly remit with the provision of\ninstruction in phonological skills or word identification strategies may indicate a specific\nSpecific Learning Disorder\n69\nlearning disorder. Evidence of persistent learning difficulties may be derived from cumulative\nschool reports, portfolios of the child’s evaluated work, curriculum-based measures, or clinical\ninterview. In adults, persistent difficulty refers to ongoing difficulties in literacy or numeracy\nskills that manifest during childhood or adolescence, as indicated by cumulative evidence\nfrom school reports, evaluated portfolios of work, or previous assessments.\nA second key feature is that the individual’s performance of the affected academic skills is\nwell below average for age (Criterion B). One robust clinical indicator of difficulties learning\nacademic skills is low academic achievement for age or average achievement that is sustain-\nable only by extraordinarily high levels of effort or support. In children, the low academic skills\ncause significant interference in school performance (as indicated by school reports and\nteacher’s grades or ratings). Another clinical indicator, particularly in adults, is avoidance of\nactivities that require the academic skills. Also in adulthood, low academic skills interfere with\noccupational performance or everyday activities requiring those skills (as indicated by self-re-\nport or report by others). However, this criterion also requires psychometric evidence from an\nindividually administered, psychometrically sound and culturally appropriate test of aca-\ndemic achievement that is norm-referenced or criterion-referenced. Academic skills are dis-\ntributed along a continuum, so there is no natural cutpoint that can be used to differentiate\nindividuals with and without specific learning disorder. Thus, any threshold used to specify\nwhat constitutes significantly low academic achievement (e.g., academic skills well below age\nexpectation) is to a large extent arbitrary. Low achievement scores on one or more standard-\nized tests or subtests within an academic domain (i.e., at least 1.5 standard deviations [SD] be-\nlow the population mean for age, which translates to a standard score of 78 or less, which is\nbelow the 7th percentile) are needed for the greatest diagnostic certainty. However, precise\nscores will vary according to the particular standardized tests that are used. On the basis of\nclinical judgment, a more lenient threshold may be used (e.g., 1.0–2.5 SD below the pop-\nulation mean for age), when learning difficulties are supported by converging evidence\nfrom clinical assessment, academic history, school reports, or test scores. Moreover, since\nstandardized tests are not available in all languages, the diagnosis may then be based in\npart on clinical judgment of scores on available test measures.\nA third core feature is that the learning difficulties are readily apparent in the early\nschool years in most individuals (Criterion C). However, in others, the learning difficulties\nmay not manifest fully until later school years, by which time learning demands have in-\ncreased and exceed the individual’s limited capacities.\nAnother key diagnostic feature is that the learning difficulties are considered “spe-\ncific,” for four reasons. First, they are not attributable to intellectual disabilities (intellec-\ntual disability [intellectual developmental disorder]); global developmental delay;\nhearing or vision disorders, or neurological or motor disorders) (Criterion D). Specific\nlearning disorder affects learning in individuals who otherwise demonstrate normal lev-\nels of intellectual functioning (generally estimated by an IQ score of greater than about 70\n[±5 points allowing for measurement error]). The phrase “unexpected academic under-\nachievement” is often cited as the defining characteristic of specific learning disorder in\nthat the specific learning disabilities are not part of a more general learning difficulty as\nmanifested in intellectual disability or global developmental delay. Specific learning dis-\norder may also occur in individuals identified as intellectually “gifted.” These individuals\nmay be able to sustain apparently adequate academic functioning by using compensatory\nstrategies, extraordinarily high effort, or support, until the learning demands or assess-\nment procedures (e.g., timed tests) pose barriers to their demonstrating their learning or\naccomplishing required tasks. Second, the learning difficulty cannot be attributed to more\ngeneral external factors, such as economic or environmental disadvantage, chronic absen-\nteeism, or lack of education as typically provided in the individual’s community context.\nThird, the learning difficulty cannot be attributed to a neurological (e.g., pediatric stroke)\nor motor disorders or to vision or hearing disorders, which are often associated with prob-\nlems learning academic skills but are distinguishable by presence of neurological signs.\n70\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nFinally, the learning difficulty may be restricted to one academic skill or domain (e.g., read-\ning single words, retrieving or calculating number facts).\nComprehensive assessment is required. Specific learning disorder can only be diagnosed\nafter formal education starts but can be diagnosed at any point afterward in children, adoles-\ncents, or adults, providing there is evidence of onset during the years of formal schooling (i.e.,\nthe developmental period). No single data source is sufficient for a diagnosis of specific learn-\ning disorder. Rather, specific learning disorder is a clinical diagnosis based on a synthesis of\nthe individual’s medical, developmental, educational, and family history; the history of the\nlearning difficulty, including its previous and current manifestation; the impact of the diffi-\nculty on academic, occupational, or social functioning; previous or current school reports;\nportfolios of work requiring academic skills; curriculum-based assessments; and previous or\ncurrent scores from individual standardized tests of academic achievement. If an intellectual,\nsensory, neurological, or motor disorder is suspected, then the clinical assessment for specific\nlearning disorder should also include methods appropriate for these disorders. Thus, compre-\nhensive assessment will involve professionals with expertise in specific learning disorder and\npsychological/cognitive assessment. Since specific learning disorder typically persists into\nadulthood, reassessment is rarely necessary, unless indicated by marked changes in the learn-\ning difficulties (amelioration or worsening) or requested for specific purposes.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nSpecific learning disorder is frequently but not invariably preceded, in preschool years, by\ndelays in attention, language, or motor skills that may persist and co-occur with specific\nlearning disorder. An uneven profile of abilities is common, such as above-average abili-\nties in drawing, design, and other visuospatial abilities, but slow, effortful, and inaccurate\nreading and poor reading comprehension and written expression. Individuals with spe-\ncific learning disorder typically (but not invariably) exhibit poor performance on psycho-\nlogical tests of cognitive processing. However, it remains unclear whether these cognitive\nabnormalities are the cause, correlate, or consequence of the learning difficulties. Also, al-\nthough cognitive deficits associated with difficulties learning to read words are well doc-\numented, those associated with other manifestations of specific learning disorder (e.g.,\nreading comprehension, arithmetic computation, written expression) are underspecified\nor unknown. Moreover, individuals with similar behavioral symptoms or test scores are\nfound to have a variety of cognitive deficits, and many of these processing deficits are also\nfound in other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disor-\nder [ADHD], autistic spectrum disorder, communication disorders, developmental coor-\ndination disorder). Thus, assessment of cognitive processing deficits is not required for\ndiagnostic assessment. Specific learning disorder is associated with increased risk for sui-\ncidal ideation and suicide attempts in children, adolescents, and adults.\nThere are no known biological markers of specific learning disorder. As a group, indi-\nviduals with the disorder show circumscribed alterations in cognitive processing and\nbrain structure and function. Genetic differences are also evident at the group level. But\ncognitive testing, neuroimaging, or genetic testing are not useful for diagnosis at this time.\nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of specific learning disorder across the academic domains of reading, writ-\ning, and mathematics is 5%–15% among school-age children across different languages\nand cultures. Prevalence in adults is unknown but appears to be approximately 4%.\nDevelopment and Course\nOnset, recognition, and diagnosis of specific learning disorder usually occurs during the\nelementary school years when children are required to learn to read, spell, write, and learn\nSpecific Learning Disorder\n71\nmathematics. However, precursors such as language delays or deficits, difficulties in\nrhyming or counting, or difficulties with fine motor skills required for writing commonly\noccur in early childhood before the start of formal schooling. Manifestations may be be-\nhavioral (e.g., a reluctance to engage in learning; oppositional behavior). Specific learning\ndisorder is lifelong, but the course and clinical expression are variable, in part depending\non the interactions among the task demands of the environment, the range and severity of\nthe individual’s learning difficulties, the individual’s learning abilities, comorbidity, and\nthe available support systems and intervention. Nonetheless, problems with reading flu-\nency and comprehension, spelling, written expression, and numeracy skills in everyday life\ntypically persist into adulthood.\nChanges in manifestation of symptoms occur with age, so that an individual may have\na persistent or shifting array of learning difficulties across the lifespan.\nExamples of symptoms that may be observed among preschool-age children include a lack\nof interest in playing games with language sounds (e.g., repetition, rhyming), and they may\nhave trouble learning nursery rhymes. Preschool children with specific learning disorder may\nfrequently use baby talk, mispronounce words, and have trouble remembering names of let-\nters, numbers, or days of the week. They may fail to recognize letters in their own names and\nhave trouble learning to count. Kindergarten-age children with specific learning disorder may\nbe unable to recognize and write letters, may be unable to write their own names, or may use\ninvented spelling. They may have trouble breaking down spoken words into syllables (e.g.,\n“cowboy” into “cow” and “boy”) and trouble recognizing words that rhyme (e.g., cat, bat, hat).\nKindergarten-age children also may have trouble connecting letters with their sounds (e.g., let-\nter b makes the sound /b/) and may be unable to recognize phonemes (e.g., do not know\nwhich in a set of words [e.g., dog, man, car] starts with the same sound as “cat”).\nSpecific learning disorder in elementary school–age children typically manifests as\nmarked difficulty learning letter-sound correspondence (particularly in English-speaking\nchildren), fluent word decoding, spelling, or math facts; reading aloud is slow, inaccurate,\nand effortful, and some children struggle to understand the magnitude that a spoken or\nwritten number represents. Children in primary grades (grades 1–3) may continue to have\nproblems recognizing and manipulating phonemes, be unable to read common one-sylla-\nble words (such as mat or top), and be unable recognize common irregularly spelled\nwords (e.g., said, two). They may commit reading errors that indicate problems in con-\nnecting sounds and letters (e.g., “big” for “got”) and have difficulty sequencing numbers\nand letters. Children in grades 1-3 also may have difficulty remembering number facts or\narithmetic procedures for adding, subtracting, and so forth, and may complain that read-\ning or arithmetic is hard and avoid doing it. Children with specific learning disorder in the\nmiddle grades (grades 4–6) may mispronounce or skip parts of long, multisyllable words\n(e.g., say “conible” for “convertible,” “aminal” for “animal”) and confuse words that\nsound alike (e.g., “tornado” for “volcano”). They may have trouble remembering dates,\nnames, and telephone numbers and may have trouble completing homework or tests on\ntime. Children in the middle grades also may have poor comprehension with or without\nslow, effortful, and inaccurate reading, and they may have trouble reading small function\nwords (e.g., that, the, an, in). They may have very poor spelling and poor written work.\nThey may get the first part of a word correctly, then guess wildly (e.g., read “clover” as\n“clock”), and may express fear of reading aloud or refuse to read aloud.\nBy contrast, adolescents may have mastered word decoding, but reading remains slow\nand effortful, and they are likely to show marked problems in reading comprehension and\nwritten expression (including poor spelling) and poor mastery of math facts or mathemat-\nical problem solving. During adolescence and into adulthood, individuals with specific\nlearning disorder may continue to make numerous spelling mistakes and read single\nwords and connected text slowly and with much effort, with trouble pronouncing multi-\nsyllable words. They may frequently need to reread material to understand or get the main\npoint and have trouble making inferences from written text. Adolescents and adults may\n72\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\navoid activities that demand reading or arithmetic (reading for pleasure, reading instruc-\ntions). Adults with specific learning disorder have ongoing spelling problems, slow and\neffortful reading, or problems making important inferences from numerical information\nin work-related written documents. They may avoid both leisure and work-related activ-\nities that demand reading or writing or use alternative approaches to access print (e.g.,\ntext-to-speech/speech-to-text software, audiobooks, audiovisual media).\nAn alternative clinical expression is that of circumscribed learning difficulties that per-\nsist across the lifespan, such as an inability to master the basic sense of number (e.g., to\nknow which of a pair of numbers or dots represents the larger magnitude), or lack of pro-\nficiency in word identification or spelling. Avoidance of or reluctance to engage in activi-\nties requiring academic skills is common in children, adolescents, and adults. Episodes of\nsevere anxiety or anxiety disorders, including somatic complaints or panic attacks, are\ncommon across the lifespan and accompany both the circumscribed and the broader ex-\npression of learning difficulties.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nEnvironmental.\nPrematurity or very low birth weight increases the risk for specific\nlearning disorder, as does prenatal exposure to nicotine.\nGenetic and physiological.\nSpecific learning disorder appears to aggregate in families,\nparticularly when affecting reading, mathematics, and spelling. The relative risk of spe-\ncific learning disorder in reading or mathematics is substantially higher (e.g., 4–8 times\nand 5–10 times higher, respectively) in first-degree relatives of individuals with these\nlearning difficulties compared with those without them. Family history of reading diffi-\nculties (dyslexia) and parental literacy skills predict literacy problems or specific learning\ndisorder in offspring, indicating the combined role of genetic and environmental factors.\nThere is high heritability for both reading ability and reading disability in alphabetic and\nnonalphabetic languages, including high heritability for most manifestations of learning abil-\nities and disabilities (e.g., heritability estimate values greater than 0.6). Covariation between\nvarious manifestations of learning difficulties is high, suggesting that genes related to one\npresentation are highly correlated with genes related to another manifestation.\nCourse modifiers.\nMarked problems with inattentive behavior in preschool years is pre-\ndictive of later difficulties in reading and mathematics (but not necessarily specific learn-\ning disorder) and nonresponse to effective academic interventions. Delay or disorders in\nspeech or language, or impaired cognitive processing (e.g., phonological awareness,\nworking memory, rapid serial naming) in preschool years, predicts later specific learning\ndisorder in reading and written expression. Comorbidity with ADHD is predictive of\nworse mental health outcome than that associated with specific learning disorder without\nADHD. Systematic, intensive, individualized instruction, using evidence-based interven-\ntions, may improve or ameliorate the learning difficulties in some individuals or promote\nthe use of compensatory strategies in others, thereby mitigating the otherwise poor out-\ncomes.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nSpecific learning disorder occurs across languages, cultures, races, and socioeconomic\nconditions but may vary in its manifestation according to the nature of the spoken and\nwritten symbol systems and cultural and educational practices. For example, the cognitive\nprocessing requirements of reading and of working with numbers vary greatly across or-\nthographies. In the English language, the observable hallmark clinical symptom of diffi-\nculties learning to read is inaccurate and slow reading of single words; in other alphabetic\nlanguages that have more direct mapping between sounds and letters (e.g., Spanish, Ger-\nman) and in non-alphabetic languages (e.g., Chinese, Japanese), the hallmark feature is\nSpecific Learning Disorder\n73\nslow but accurate reading. In English-language learners, assessment should include con-\nsideration of whether the source of reading difficulties is a limited proficiency with Eng-\nlish or a specific learning disorder. Risk factors for specific learning disorder in English-\nlanguage learners include a family history of specific learning disorder or language delay\nin the native language, as well as learning difficulties in English and failure to catch up\nwith peers. If there is suspicion of cultural or language differences (e.g., as in an English-\nlanguage learner), the assessment needs to take into account the individual’s language\nproficiency in his or her first or native language as well as in the second language (in this\nexample, English). Also, assessment should consider the linguistic and cultural context in\nwhich the individual is living, as well as his or her educational and learning history in the\noriginal culture and language.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nSpecific learning disorder is more common in males than in females (ratios range from\nabout 2:1 to 3:1) and cannot be attributed to factors such as ascertainment bias, definitional\nor measurement variation, language, race, or socioeconomic status.\nFunctional Consequences of\nSpecific Learning Disorder\nSpecific learning disorder can have negative functional consequences across the lifespan,\nincluding lower academic attainment, higher rates of high school dropout, lower rates of\npostsecondary education, high levels of psychological distress and poorer overall mental\nhealth, higher rates of unemployment and under-employment, and lower incomes. School\ndropout and co-occurring depressive symptoms increase the risk for poor mental health\noutcomes, including suicidality, whereas high levels of social or emotional support predict\nbetter mental health outcomes.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nNormal variations in academic attainment.\nSpecific learning disorder is distinguished\nfrom normal variations in academic attainment due to external factors (e.g., lack of edu-\ncational opportunity, consistently poor instruction, learning in a second language), be-\ncause the learning difficulties persist in the presence of adequate educational opportunity\nand exposure to the same instruction as the peer group, and competency in the language of\ninstruction, even when it is different from one’s primary spoken language.\nIntellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).\nSpecific learning disorder\ndiffers from general learning difficulties associated with intellectual disability, because the\nlearning difficulties occur in the presence of normal levels of intellectual functioning (i.e.,\nIQ score of at least 70 ± 5). If intellectual disability is present, specific learning disorder can\nbe diagnosed only when the learning difficulties are in excess of those usually associated\nwith the intellectual disability.\nLearning difficulties due to neurological or sensory disorders.\nSpecific learning dis-\norder is distinguished from learning difficulties due to neurological or sensory disorders\n(e.g., pediatric stroke, traumatic brain injury, hearing impairment, vision impairment), be-\ncause in these cases there are abnormal findings on neurological examination.\nNeurocognitive disorders.\nSpecific learning disorder is distinguished from learning\nproblems associated with neurodegenerative cognitive disorders, because in specific\nlearning disorder the clinical expression of specific learning difficulties occurs during the\ndevelopmental period, and the difficulties do not manifest as a marked decline from a for-\nmer state.\n74\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nSpecific learning disorder is distinguished from\nthe poor academic performance associated with ADHD, because in the latter condition the\nproblems may not necessarily reflect specific difficulties in learning academic skills but\nrather may reflect difficulties in performing those skills. However, the co-occurrence of\nspecific learning disorder and ADHD is more frequent than expected by chance. If criteria\nfor both disorders are met, both diagnoses can be given.\nPsychotic disorders.\nSpecific learning disorder is distinguished from the academic and\ncognitive-processing difficulties associated with schizophrenia or psychosis, because with\nthese disorders there is a decline (often rapid) in these functional domains.\nComorbidity \nSpecific learning disorder commonly co-occurs with neurodevelopmental (e.g., ADHD,\ncommunication disorders, developmental coordination disorder, autistic spectrum disor-\nder) or other mental disorders (e.g., anxiety disorders, depressive and bipolar disorders).\nThese comorbidities do not necessarily exclude the diagnosis specific learning disorder\nbut may make testing and differential diagnosis more difficult, because each of the co-\noccurring disorders independently interferes with the execution of activities of daily liv-\ning, including learning. Thus, clinical judgment is required to attribute such impairment to\nlearning difficulties. If there is an indication that another diagnosis could account for the\ndifficulties learning keystone academic skills described in Criterion A, specific learning\ndisorder should not be diagnosed. \nMotor Disorders", "provenance": {"source_file": "neurodevelopmental_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 13, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.484382"}}

The acquisition and execution of coordinated motor skills is substantially below that ex-\npected given the individual’s chronological age and opportunity for skill learning and\nuse. Difficulties are manifested as clumsiness (e.g., dropping or bumping into objects)\nas well as slowness and inaccuracy of performance of motor skills (e.g., catching an\nobject, using scissors or cutlery, handwriting, riding a bike, or participating in sports). \nB. The motor skills deficit in Criterion A significantly and persistently interferes with activ-\nities of daily living appropriate to chronological age (e.g., self-care and self-mainte-\nnance) and impacts academic/school productivity, prevocational and vocational\nactivities, leisure, and play.\nC. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.\nD. The motor skills deficits are not better explained by intellectual disability (intellectual devel-\nopmental disorder) or visual impairment and are not attributable to a neurological condi-\ntion affecting movement (e.g., cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, degenerative disorder).\nDiagnostic Features\nThe diagnosis of developmental coordination disorder is made by a clinical synthesis of the\nhistory (developmental and medical), physical examination, school or workplace report, and\nindividual assessment using psychometrically sound and culturally appropriate standardized\ntests. The manifestation of impaired skills requiring motor coordination (Criterion A) varies\nDevelopmental Coordination Disorder\n75\nwith age. Young children may be delayed in achieving motor milestones (i.e., sitting, crawling,\nwalking), although many achieve typical motor milestones. They also may be delayed in de-\nveloping skills such as negotiating stairs, pedaling, buttoning shirts, completing puzzles, and\nusing zippers. Even when the skill is achieved, movement execution may appear awkward,\nslow, or less precise than that of peers. Older children and adults may display slow speed or in-\naccuracy with motor aspects of activities such as assembling puzzles, building models, playing\nball games (especially in teams), handwriting, typing, driving, or carrying out self-care skills.\nDevelopmental coordination disorder is diagnosed only if the impairment in motor\nskills significantly interferes with the performance of, or participation in, daily activities in\nfamily, social, school, or community life (Criterion B). Examples of such activities include\ngetting dressed, eating meals with age-appropriate utensils and without mess, engaging\nin physical games with others, using specific tools in class such as rulers and scissors, and\nparticipating in team exercise activities at school. Not only is ability to perform these ac-\ntions impaired, but also marked slowness in execution is common. Handwriting compe-\ntence is frequently affected, consequently affecting legibility and/or speed of written output\nand affecting academic achievement (the impact is distinguished from specific learning\ndifficulty by the emphasis on the motoric component of written output skills). In adults,\neveryday skills in education and work, especially those in which speed and accuracy are\nrequired, are affected by coordination problems.\nCriterion C states that the onset of symptoms of developmental coordination disorder\nmust be in the early developmental period. However, developmental coordination disorder is\ntypically not diagnosed before age 5 years because there is considerable variation in the age at\nacquisition of many motor skills or a lack of stability of measurement in early childhood (e.g.,\nsome children catch up) or because other causes of motor delay may not have fully manifested.\nCriterion D specifies that the diagnosis of developmental coordination disorder is\nmade if the coordination difficulties are not better explained by visual impairment or at-\ntributable to a neurological condition. Thus, visual function examination and neurological\nexamination must be included in the diagnostic evaluation. If intellectual disability (intel-\nlectual developmental disorder) is present, the motor difficulties are in excess of those ex-\npected for the mental age; however, no IQ cut-off or discrepancy criterion is specified.\nDevelopmental coordination disorder does not have discrete subtypes; however, indi-\nviduals may be impaired predominantly in gross motor skills or in fine motor skills, in-\ncluding handwriting skills.\nOther terms used to describe developmental coordination disorder include childhood\ndyspraxia, specific developmental disorder of motor function, and clumsy child syndrome.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nSome children with developmental coordination disorder show additional (usually sup-\npressed) motor activity, such as choreiform movements of unsupported limbs or mirror\nmovements. These “overflow” movements are referred to as neurodevelopmental immaturities or\nneurological soft signs rather than neurological abnormalities. In both current literature and\nclinical practice, their role in diagnosis is still unclear, requiring further evaluation.\nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of developmental coordination disorder in children ages 5–11 years is 5%–\n6% (in children age 7 years, 1.8% are diagnosed with severe developmental coordination\ndisorder and 3% with probable developmental coordination disorder). Males are more of-\nten affected than females, with a male:female ratio between 2:1 and 7:1.\nDevelopment and Course\nThe course of developmental coordination disorder is variable but stable at least to 1 year\nfollow-up. Although there may be improvement in the longer term, problems with coor-\n76\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\ndinated movements continue through adolescence in an estimated 50%–70% of children.\nOnset is in early childhood. Delayed motor milestones may be the first signs, or the disor-\nder is first recognized when the child attempts tasks such as holding a knife and fork, but-\ntoning clothes, or playing ball games. In middle childhood, there are difficulties with\nmotor aspects of assembling puzzles, building models, playing ball, and handwriting, as\nwell as with organizing belongings, when motor sequencing and coordination are re-\nquired. In early adulthood, there is continuing difficulty in learning new tasks involving\ncomplex/automatic motor skills, including driving and using tools. Inability to take notes\nand handwrite quickly may affect performance in the workplace. Co-occurrence with\nother disorders (see the section “Comorbidity” for this disorder) has an additional impact\non presentation, course, and outcome.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nEnvironmental.\nDevelopmental coordination disorder is more common following pre-\nnatal exposure to alcohol and in preterm and low-birth-weight children.\nGenetic and physiological.\nImpairments in underlying neurodevelopmental processes—\nparticularly in visual-motor skills, both in visual-motor perception and spatial mentalizing—\nhave been found and affect the ability to make rapid motoric adjustments as the complexity of\nthe required movements increases. Cerebellar dysfunction has been proposed, but the neural\nbasis of developmental coordination disorder remains unclear. Because of the co-occurrence of\ndevelopmental coordination disorder with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),\nspecific learning disabilities, and autism spectrum disorder, shared genetic effect has been pro-\nposed. However, consistent co-occurrence in twins appears only in severe cases.\nCourse modifiers.\nIndividuals with ADHD and with developmental coordination dis-\norder demonstrate more impairment than individuals with ADHD without developmen-\ntal coordination disorder.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nDevelopmental coordination disorder occurs across cultures, races, and socioeconomic\nconditions. By definition, “activities of daily living” implies cultural differences necessi-\ntating consideration of the context in which the individual child is living as well as\nwhether he or she has had appropriate opportunities to learn and practice such activities. \nFunctional Consequences of \nDevelopmental Coordination Disorder \nDevelopmental coordination disorder leads to impaired functional performance in activ-\nities of daily living (Criterion B), and the impairment is increased with co-occurring con-\nditions. Consequences of developmental coordination disorder include reduced\nparticipation in team play and sports; poor self-esteem and sense of self-worth; emotional\nor behavior problems; impaired academic achievement; poor physical fitness; and re-\nduced physical activity and obesity.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nMotor impairments due to another medical condition.\nProblems in coordination may\nbe associated with visual function impairment and specific neurological disorders (e.g.,\ncerebral palsy, progressive lesions of the cerebellum, neuromuscular disorders). In such\ncases, there are additional findings on neurological examination. \nIntellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).\nIf intellectual disability is\npresent, motor competences may be impaired in accordance with the intellectual disabil-\nStereotypic Movement Disorder\n77\nity. However, if the motor difficulties are in excess of what could be accounted for by the\nintellectual disability, and criteria for developmental coordination disorder are met, de-\nvelopmental coordination disorder can be diagnosed as well. \nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nIndividuals with ADHD may fall, bump into\nobjects, or knock things over. Careful observation across different contexts is required to\nascertain if lack of motor competence is attributable to distractibility and impulsiveness\nrather than to developmental coordination disorder. If criteria for both ADHD and devel-\nopmental coordination disorder are met, both diagnoses can be given.\nAutism spectrum disorder.\nIndividuals with autism spectrum disorder may be uninter-\nested in participating in tasks requiring complex coordination skills, such as ball sports,\nwhich will affect test performance and function but not reflect core motor competence. Co-\noccurrence of developmental coordination disorder and autism spectrum disorder is com-\nmon. If criteria for both disorders are met, both diagnoses can be given.\nJoint hypermobility syndrome.\nIndividuals with syndromes causing hyperextensible\njoints (found on physical examination; often with a complaint of pain) may present with\nsymptoms similar to those of developmental coordination disorder.\nComorbidity\nDisorders that commonly co-occur with developmental coordination disorder include\nspeech and language disorder; specific learning disorder (especially reading and writing);\nproblems of inattention, including ADHD (the most frequent coexisting condition, with\nabout 50% co-occurrence); autism spectrum disorder; disruptive and emotional behavior\nproblems; and joint hypermobility syndrome. Different clusters of co-occurrence may be\npresent (e.g., a cluster with severe reading disorders, fine motor problems, and handwriting\nproblems; another cluster with impaired movement control and motor planning). Presence\nof other disorders does not exclude developmental coordination disorder but may make\ntesting more difficult and may independently interfere with the execution of activities of\ndaily living, thus requiring examiner judgment in ascribing impairment to motor skills.", "provenance": {"source_file": "neurodevelopmental_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 14, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.484382"}}

Self-injurious behaviors range in se-\nverity along various dimensions, including the frequency, impact on adaptive functioning,\nand severity of bodily injury (from mild bruising or erythema from hitting hand against\nbody, to lacerations or amputation of digits, to retinal detachment from head banging).\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of stereotypic movement disorder is repetitive, seemingly driven,\nand apparently purposeless motor behavior (Criterion A). These behaviors are often\nrhythmical movements of the head, hands, or body without obvious adaptive function.\nThe movements may or may not respond to efforts to stop them. Among typically devel-\noping children, the repetitive movements may be stopped when attention is directed to\nthem or when the child is distracted from performing them. Among children with neuro-\ndevelopmental disorders, the behaviors are typically less responsive to such efforts. In\nother cases, the individual demonstrates self-restraining behaviors (e.g., sitting on hands,\nwrapping arms in clothing, finding a protective device).\nThe repertoire of behaviors is variable; each individual presents with his or her own in-\ndividually patterned, “signature” behavior. Examples of non-self-injurious stereotypic\nmovements include, but are not limited to, body rocking, bilateral flapping or rotating\nhand movements, flicking or fluttering fingers in front of the face, arm waving or flapping,\nand head nodding. Stereotyped self-injurious behaviors include, but are not limited to, re-\npetitive head banging, face slapping, eye poking, and biting of hands, lips, or other body\nparts. Eye poking is particularly concerning; it occurs more frequently among children\nwith visual impairment. Multiple movements may be combined (e.g., cocking the head,\nrocking the torso, waving a small string repetitively in front of the face).\nStereotypic movements may occur many times during a day, lasting a few seconds to\nseveral minutes or longer. Frequency can vary from many occurrences in a single day to\nseveral weeks elapsing between episodes. The behaviors vary in context, occurring when\nthe individual is engrossed in other activities, when excited, stressed, fatigued, or bored.\nCriterion A requires that the movements be “apparently” purposeless. However, some\nfunctions may be served by the movements. For example, stereotypic movements might\nreduce anxiety in response to external stressors.\nCriterion B states that the stereotypic movements interfere with social, academic, or\nother activities and, in some children, may result in self-injury (or would if protective mea-\nsures were not used). If self-injury is present, it should be coded using the specifier. Onset\nStereotypic Movement Disorder\n79\nof stereotypic movements is in the early developmental period (Criterion C). Criterion D\nstates that the repetitive, stereotyped behavior in stereotypic movement disorder is not at-\ntributable to the physiological effects of a substance or neurological condition and is not\nbetter explained by another neurodevelopmental or mental disorder. The presence of\nstereotypic movements may indicate an undetected neurodevelopmental problem, espe-\ncially in children ages 1–3 years.\nPrevalence \nSimple stereotypic movements (e.g., rocking) are common in young typically developing chil-\ndren. Complex stereotypic movements are much less common (occurring in approximately\n3%–4%). Between 4% and 16% of individuals with intellectual disability (intellectual develop-\nmental disorder) engage in stereotypy and self-injury. The risk is greater in individuals with\nsevere intellectual disability. Among individuals with intellectual disability living in res-\nidential facilities, 10%–15% may have stereotypic movement disorder with self-injury.\nDevelopment and Course \nStereotypic movements typically begin within the first 3 years of life. Simple stereotypic move-\nments are common in infancy and may be involved in acquisition of motor mastery. In chil-\ndren who develop complex motor stereotypies, approximately 80% exhibit symptoms before\n24 months of age, 12% between 24 and 35 months, and 8% at 36 months or older. In most typ-\nically developing children, these movements resolve over time or can be suppressed. Onset of\ncomplex motor stereotypies may be in infancy or later in the developmental period. Among\nindividuals with intellectual disability, the stereotyped, self-injurious behaviors may persist\nfor years, even though the typography or pattern of self-injury may change.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nEnvironmental.\nSocial isolation is a risk factor for self-stimulation that may progress to\nstereotypic movements with repetitive self-injury. Environmental stress may also trigger\nstereotypic behavior. Fear may alter physiological state, resulting in increased frequency\nof stereotypic behaviors.\nGenetic and physiological.\nLower cognitive functioning is linked to greater risk for stereo-\ntypic behaviors and poorer response to interventions. Stereotypic movements are more fre-\nquent among individuals with moderate-to-severe/profound intellectual disability, who by\nvirtue of a particular syndrome (e.g., Rett syndrome) or environmental factor (e.g., an environ-\nment with relatively insufficient stimulation) seem to be at higher risk for stereotypies. Repet-\nitive self-injurious behavior may be a behavioral phenotype in neurogenetic syndromes. For\nexample, in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, there are both stereotypic dystonic movements and self-\nmutilation of fingers, lip biting, and other forms of self-injury unless the individual is re-\nstrained, and in Rett syndrome and Cornelia de Lange syndrome, self-injury may result from\nthe hand-to-mouth stereotypies. Stereotypic behaviors may result from a painful medical con-\ndition (e.g., middle ear infection, dental problems, gastroesophageal reflux).\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nStereotypic movement disorder, with or without self-injury, occurs in all races and cultures.\nCultural attitudes toward unusual behaviors may result in delayed diagnosis. Overall cultural\ntolerance and attitudes toward stereotypic movement vary and must be considered.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nNormal development.\nSimple stereotypic movements are common in infancy and early\nchildhood. Rocking may occur in the transition from sleep to awake, a behavior that usu-\n80\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nally resolves with age. Complex stereotypies are less common in typically developing\nchildren and can usually be suppressed by distraction or sensory stimulation. The indi-\nvidual’s daily routine is rarely affected, and the movements generally do not cause the\nchild distress. The diagnosis would not be appropriate in these circumstances.\nAutism spectrum disorder.\nStereotypic movements may be a presenting symptom of\nautism spectrum disorder and should be considered when repetitive movements and be-\nhaviors are being evaluated. Deficits of social communication and reciprocity manifesting\nin autism spectrum disorder are generally absent in stereotypic movement disorder, and\nthus social interaction, social communication, and rigid repetitive behaviors and interests\nare distinguishing features. When autism spectrum disorder is present, stereotypic move-\nment disorder is diagnosed only when there is self-injury or when the stereotypic behav-\niors are sufficiently severe to become a focus of treatment.\nTic disorders.\nTypically, stereotypies have an earlier age at onset (before 3 years) than\ndo tics, which have a mean age at onset of 5–7 years. They are consistent and fixed in their\npattern or topography compared with tics, which are variable in their presentation. Ste-\nreotypies may involve arms, hands, or the entire body, while tics commonly involve eyes,\nface, head, and shoulders. Stereotypies are more fixed, rhythmic, and prolonged in dura-\ntion than tics, which, generally, are brief, rapid, random, and fluctuating. Tics and stereo-\ntypic movements are both reduced by distraction.\nObsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nStereotypic movement disorder is dis-\ntinguished from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) by the absence of obsessions, as\nwell as by the nature of the repetitive behaviors. In OCD the individual feels driven to per-\nform repetitive behaviors in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be ap-\nplied rigidly, whereas in stereotypic movement disorder the behaviors are seemingly\ndriven but apparently purposeless. Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) and excoria-\ntion (skin-picking) disorder are characterized by body-focused repetitive behaviors (i.e.,\nhair pulling and skin picking) that may be seemingly driven but that are not apparently\npurposeless, and that may not be patterned or rhythmical. Furthermore, onset in tricho-\ntillomania and excoriation disorder is not typically in the early developmental period, but\nrather around puberty or later.\nOther neurological and medical conditions.\nThe diagnosis of stereotypic movements\nrequires the exclusion of habits, mannerisms, paroxysmal dyskinesias, and benign he-\nreditary chorea. A neurological history and examination are required to assess features\nsuggestive of other disorders, such as myoclonus, dystonia, tics, and chorea. Involuntary\nmovements associated with a neurological condition may be distinguished by their signs\nand symptoms. For example, repetitive, stereotypic movements in tardive dyskinesia can\nbe distinguished by a history of chronic neuroleptic use and characteristic oral or facial\ndyskinesia or irregular trunk or limb movements. These types of movements do not result\nin self-injury. A diagnosis of stereotypic movement disorder is not appropriate for repet-\nitive skin picking or scratching associated with amphetamine intoxication or abuse (e.g.,\npatients are diagnosed with substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and re-\nlated disorder) and repetitive choreoathetoid movements associated with other neurolog-\nical disorders.\nComorbidity\nStereotypic movement disorder may occur as a primary diagnosis or secondary to another\ndisorder. For example, stereotypies are a common manifestation of a variety of neuro-\ngenetic disorders, such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Rett syndrome, fragile X syndrome,\nCornelia de Lange syndrome, and Smith-Magenis syndrome. When stereotypic move-\nment disorder co-occurs with another medical condition, both should be coded.\nTic Disorders\n81", "provenance": {"source_file": "neurodevelopmental_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 15, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.484382"}}

Criteria have never been met for Tourette’s disorder or persistent (chronic) motor or\nvocal tic disorder.\nSpecifiers \nThe “motor tics only” or “vocal tics only” specifier is only required for persistent (chronic)\nmotor or vocal tic disorder.\nDiagnostic Features\nTic disorders comprise four diagnostic categories: Tourette’s disorder, persistent (chronic)\nmotor or vocal tic disorder, provisional tic disorder, and the other specified and unspecified\ntic disorders. Diagnosis for any tic disorder is based on the presence of motor and/or vocal\ntics (Criterion A), duration of tic symptoms (Criterion B), age at onset (Criterion C), and ab-\nsence of any known cause such as another medical condition or substance use (Criterion D).\nThe tic disorders are hierarchical in order (i.e., Tourette’s disorder, followed by persistent\n[chronic] motor or vocal tic disorder, followed by provisional tic disorder, followed by the\n82\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nother specified and unspecified tic disorders), such that once a tic disorder at one level of the\nhierarchy is diagnosed, a lower hierarchy diagnosis cannot be made (Criterion E).\nTics are sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movements or vocalizations. An\nindividual may have various tic symptoms over time, but at any point in time, the tic rep-\nertoire recurs in a characteristic fashion. Although tics can include almost any muscle group\nor vocalization, certain tic symptoms, such as eye blinking or throat clearing, are common\nacross patient populations. Tics are generally experienced as involuntary but can be vol-\nuntarily suppressed for varying lengths of time.\nTics can be either simple or complex. Simple motor tics are of short duration (i.e., milli-\nseconds) and can include eye blinking, shoulder shrugging, and extension of the extrem-\nities. Simple vocal tics include throat clearing, sniffing, and grunting often caused by\ncontraction of the diaphragm or muscles of the oropharynx. Complex motor tics are of lon-\nger duration (i.e., seconds) and often include a combination of simple tics such as simul-\ntaneous head turning and shoulder shrugging. Complex tics can appear purposeful, such\nas a tic-like sexual or obscene gesture (copropraxia) or a tic-like imitation of someone else’s\nmovements (echopraxia). Similarly, complex vocal tics include repeating one’s own sounds\nor words (palilalia), repeating the last-heard word or phrase (echolalia), or uttering socially\nunacceptable words, including obscenities, or ethnic, racial, or religious slurs (coprolalia).\nImportantly, coprolalia is an abrupt, sharp bark or grunt utterance and lacks the prosody\nof similar inappropriate speech observed in human interactions.\nThe presence of motor and/or vocal tics varies across the four tic disorders (Criterion\nA). For Tourette’s disorder, both motor and vocal tics must be present, whereas for per-\nsistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder, only motor or only vocal tics are present. For\nprovisional tic disorder, motor and/or vocal tics may be present. For other specified or un-\nspecified tic disorders, the movement disorder symptoms are best characterized as tics but\nare atypical in presentation or age at onset, or have a known etiology.\nThe 1-year minimum duration criterion (Criterion B) assures that individuals diag-\nnosed with either Tourette’s disorder or persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder\nhave had persistent symptoms. Tics wax and wane in severity, and some individuals may\nhave tic-free periods of weeks to months; however, an individual who has had tic symp-\ntoms of greater than 1 year’s duration since first tic onset would be considered to have per-\nsistent symptoms regardless of duration of tic-free periods. For an individual with motor\nand/or vocal tics of less than 1 year since first tic onset, a provisional tic disorder diagnosis\ncan be considered. There is no duration specification for other specified and unspecified tic\ndisorders. The onset of tics must occur prior to age 18 years (Criterion C). Tic disorders\ntypically begin in the prepubertal period, with an average age at onset between 4 and 6\nyears, and with the incidence of new-onset tic disorders decreasing in the teen years. New\nonset of tic symptoms in adulthood is exceedingly rare and is often associated with expo-\nsures to drugs (e.g., excessive cocaine use) or is a result of a central nervous system insult\n(e.g., postviral encephalitis). Although tic onset is uncommon in teenagers and adults, it is\nnot uncommon for adolescents and adults to present for an initial diagnostic assessment\nand, when carefully evaluated, provide a history of milder symptoms dating back to child-\nhood. New-onset abnormal movements suggestive of tics outside of the usual age range\nshould result in evaluation for other movement disorders or for specific etiologies.\nTic symptoms cannot be attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or an-\nother medical condition (Criterion D). When there is strong evidence from the history,\nphysical examination, and/or laboratory results to suggest a plausible, proximal, and\nprobable cause for a tic disorder, a diagnosis of other specified tic disorder should be used.\nHaving previously met diagnostic criteria for Tourette’s disorder negates a possible di-\nagnosis of persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder (Criterion E). Similarly, a previ-\nous diagnosis of persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder negates a diagnosis of\nprovisional tic disorder or other specified or unspecified tic disorder (Criterion E).\nTic Disorders\n83\nPrevalence\nTics are common in childhood but transient in most cases. The estimated prevalence of\nTourette’s disorder ranges from 3 to 8 per 1,000 in school-age children. Males are more\ncommonly affected than females, with the ratio varying from 2:1 to 4:1. A national survey\nin the United States estimated 3 per 1,000 for the prevalence of clinically identified cases.\nThe frequency of identified cases was lower among African Americans and Hispanic\nAmericans, which may be related to differences in access to care.\nDevelopment and Course\nOnset of tics is typically between ages 4 and 6 years. Peak severity occurs between ages 10\nand 12 years, with a decline in severity during adolescence. Many adults with tic disorders\nexperience diminished symptoms. A small percentage of individuals will have persis-\ntently severe or worsening symptoms in adulthood.\nTic symptoms manifest similarly in all age groups and across the lifespan. Tics wax and\nwane in severity and change in affected muscle groups and vocalizations over time. As\nchildren get older, they begin to report their tics being associated with a premonitory\nurge—a somatic sensation that precedes the tic—and a feeling of tension reduction follow-\ning the expression of the tic. Tics associated with a premonitory urge may be experienced\nas not completely “involuntary” in that the urge and the tic can be resisted. An individual\nmay also feel the need to perform a tic in a specific way or repeat it until he or she achieves\nthe feeling that the tic has been done “just right.”\nThe vulnerability toward developing co-occurring conditions changes as individuals\npass through the age of risk for various co-occurring conditions. For example, prepubertal\nchildren with tic disorders are more likely to experience attention-deficit/hyperactivity\ndisorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and separation anxiety disorder\nthan are teenagers and adults, who are more likely to experience the new onset of major\ndepressive disorder, substance use disorder, or bipolar disorder.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nTemperamental.\nTics are worsened by anxiety, excitement, and exhaustion and are better\nduring calm, focused activities. Individuals may have fewer tics when engaged in schoolwork\nor tasks at work than when relaxing at home after school or in the evening. Stressful/exciting\nevents (e.g., taking a test, participating in exciting activities) often make tics worse. \nEnvironmental.\nObserving a gesture or sound in another person may result in an indi-\nvidual with a tic disorder making a similar gesture or sound, which may be incorrectly\nperceived by others as purposeful. This can be a particular problem when the individual is\ninteracting with authority figures (e.g., teachers, supervisors, police).\nGenetic and physiological.\nGenetic and environmental factors influence tic symptom\nexpression and severity. Important risk alleles for Tourette’s disorder and rare genetic\nvariants in families with tic disorders have been identified. Obstetrical complications,\nolder paternal age, lower birth weight, and maternal smoking during pregnancy are as-\nsociated with worse tic severity.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nTic disorders do not appear to vary in clinical characteristics, course, or etiology by race,\nethnicity, and culture. However, race, ethnicity, and culture may impact how tic disorders\nare perceived and managed in the family and community, as well as influencing patterns\nof help seeking, and choices of treatment.\n84\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nMales are more commonly affected than females, but there are no gender differences in the\nkinds of tics, age at onset, or course. Women with persistent tic disorders may be more\nlikely to experience anxiety and depression.\nFunctional Consequences of Tic Disorders\nMany individuals with mild to moderate tic severity experience no distress or impairment\nin functioning and may even be unaware of their tics. Individuals with more severe symp-\ntoms generally have more impairment in daily living, but even individuals with moderate\nor even severe tic disorders may function well. The presence of a co-occurring condition,\nsuch as ADHD or OCD, can have greater impact on functioning. Less commonly, tics dis-\nrupt functioning in daily activities and result in social isolation, interpersonal conflict,\npeer victimization, inability to work or to go to school, and lower quality of life. The indi-\nvidual also may experience substantial psychological distress. Rare complications of Tou-\nrette’s disorder include physical injury, such as eye injury (from hitting oneself in the face),\nand orthopedic and neurological injury (e.g., disc disease related to forceful head and neck\nmovements).\nDifferential Diagnosis\nAbnormal movements that may accompany other medical conditions and stereotypic\nmovement disorder.\nMotor stereotypies are defined as involuntary rhythmic, repetitive,\npredictable movements that appear purposeful but serve no obvious adaptive function or\npurpose and stop with distraction. Examples include repetitive hand waving/rotating,\narm flapping, and finger wiggling. Motor stereotypies can be differentiated from tics based\non the former’s earlier age at onset (younger than 3 years), prolonged duration (seconds to\nminutes), constant repetitive fixed form and location, exacerbation when engrossed in ac-\ntivities, lack of a premonitory urge, and cessation with distraction (e.g., name called or\ntouched). Chorea represents rapid, random, continual, abrupt, irregular, unpredictable,\nnonstereotyped actions that are usually bilateral and affect all parts of the body (i.e., face,\ntrunk, and limbs). The timing, direction, and distribution of movements vary from mo-\nment to moment, and movements usually worsen during attempted voluntary action. Dys-\ntonia is the simultaneous sustained contracture of both agonist and antagonist muscles,\nresulting in a distorted posture or movement of parts of the body. Dystonic postures are of-\nten triggered by attempts at voluntary movements and are not seen during sleep.\nSubstance-induced and paroxysmal dyskinesias.\nParoxysmal dyskinesias usually oc-\ncur as dystonic or choreoathetoid movements that are precipitated by voluntary move-\nment or exertion and less commonly arise from normal background activity.\nMyoclonus.\nMyoclonus is characterized by a sudden unidirectional movement that is\noften nonrhythmic. It may be worsened by movement and occur during sleep. Myoclonus\nis differentiated from tics by its rapidity, lack of suppressibility, and absence of a premon-\nitory urge.\nObsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nDifferentiating obsessive-compulsive\nbehaviors from tics may be difficult. Clues favoring an obsessive-compulsive behavior in-\nclude a cognitive-based drive (e.g., fear of contamination) and the need to perform the ac-\ntion in a particular fashion a certain number of times, equally on both sides of the body, or\nuntil a “just right” feeling is achieved. Impulse-control problems and other repetitive be-\nhaviors, including persistent hair pulling, skin picking, and nail biting, appear more goal\ndirected and complex than tics.\nOther Specified Tic Disorder\n85\nComorbidity\nMany medical and psychiatric conditions have been described as co-occurring with tic disor-\nders, with ADHD and obsessive-compulsive and related disorders being particularly com-\nmon. The obsessive-compulsive symptoms observed in tic disorder tend to be characterized\nby more aggressive symmetry and order symptoms and poorer response to pharmacotherapy\nwith selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Children with ADHD may demonstrate disrup-\ntive behavior, social immaturity, and learning difficulties that may interfere with academic\nprogress and interpersonal relationships and lead to greater impairment than that caused by a\ntic disorder. Individuals with tic disorders can also have other movement disorders and other\nmental disorders, such as depressive, bipolar, or substance use disorders.", "provenance": {"source_file": "neurodevelopmental_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 16, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.484382"}}
