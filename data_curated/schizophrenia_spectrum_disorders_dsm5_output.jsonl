The presence of one (or more) delusions with a duration of 1 month or longer.\nB. Criterion A for schizophrenia has never been met. \nNote: Hallucinations, if present, are not prominent and are related to the delusional\ntheme (e.g., the sensation of being infested with insects associated with delusions of\ninfestation).\nC. Apart from the impact of the delusion(s) or its ramifications, functioning is not markedly\nimpaired, and behavior is not obviously bizarre or odd.\nD. If manic or major depressive episodes have occurred, these have been brief relative\nto the duration of the delusional periods.\nE. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or an-\nother medical condition and is not better explained by another mental disorder, such\nas body dysmorphic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nSpecify whether:\nErotomanic type: This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion is that\nanother person is in love with the individual.\nGrandiose type: This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion is the\nconviction of having some great (but unrecognized) talent or insight or having made\nsome important discovery.\nJealous type: This subtype applies when the central theme of the individual’s delusion\nis that his or her spouse or lover is unfaithful.\nPersecutory type: This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion in-\nvolves the individual’s belief that he or she is being conspired against, cheated, spied\non, followed, poisoned or drugged, maliciously maligned, harassed, or obstructed in\nthe pursuit of long-term goals.\nSomatic type: This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion involves\nbodily functions or sensations.\nDelusional Disorder\n91\nMixed type: This subtype applies when no one delusional theme predominates.\nUnspecified type: This subtype applies when the dominant delusional belief cannot\nbe clearly determined or is not described in the specific types (e.g., referential delu-\nsions without a prominent persecutory or grandiose component). \nSpecify if:\nWith bizarre content: Delusions are deemed bizarre if they are clearly implausible, not\nunderstandable, and not derived from ordinary life experiences (e.g., an individual’s be-\nlief that a stranger has removed his or her internal organs and replaced them with some-\none else’s organs without leaving any wounds or scars).\nSpecify if:\nThe following course specifiers are only to be used after a 1-year duration of the disorder:\nFirst episode, currently in acute episode: First manifestation of the disorder meet-\ning the defining diagnostic symptom and time criteria. An acute episode is a time pe-\nriod in which the symptom criteria are fulfilled.\nFirst episode, currently in partial remission: Partial remission is a time period dur-\ning which an improvement after a previous episode is maintained and in which the de-\nfining criteria of the disorder are only partially fulfilled.\nFirst episode, currently in full remission: Full remission is a period of time after a\nprevious episode during which no disorder-specific symptoms are present.\nMultiple episodes, currently in acute episode\nMultiple episodes, currently in partial remission\nMultiple episodes, currently in full remission\nContinuous: Symptoms fulfilling the diagnostic symptom criteria of the disorder are\nremaining for the majority of the illness course, with subthreshold symptom periods be-\ning very brief relative to the overall course.\nUnspecified\nSpecify current severity:\nSeverity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psychosis,\nincluding delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, abnormal psychomotor be-\nhavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be rated for its current\nseverity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not present)\nto 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom\nSeverity in the chapter “Assessment Measures.”)\nNote: Diagnosis of delusional disorder can be made without using this severity specifier.\nSubtypes\nIn erotomanic type, the central theme of the delusion is that another person is in love with\nthe individual. The person about whom this conviction is held is usually of higher status\n(e.g., a famous individual or a superior at work) but can be a complete stranger. Efforts to\ncontact the object of the delusion are common. In grandiose type, the central theme of the de-\nlusion is the conviction of having some great talent or insight or of having made some im-\nportant discovery. Less commonly, the individual may have the delusion of having a\nspecial relationship with a prominent individual or of being a prominent person (in which\ncase the actual individual may be regarded as an impostor). Grandiose delusions may\nhave a religious content. In jealous type, the central theme of the delusion is that of an un-\nfaithful partner. This belief is arrived at without due cause and is based on incorrect infer-\nences supported by small bits of “evidence” (e.g., disarrayed clothing). The individual\nwith the delusion usually confronts the spouse or lover and attempts to intervene in the\nimagined infidelity. In persecutory type, the central theme of the delusion involves the in-\n92\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\ndividual’s belief of being conspired against, cheated, spied on, followed, poisoned, mali-\nciously maligned, harassed, or obstructed in the pursuit of long-term goals. Small slights\nmay be exaggerated and become the focus of a delusional system. The affected individual\nmay engage in repeated attempts to obtain satisfaction by legal or legislative action. Indi-\nviduals with persecutory delusions are often resentful and angry and may resort to vio-\nlence against those they believe are hurting them. In somatic type, the central theme of the\ndelusion involves bodily functions or sensations. Somatic delusions can occur in several\nforms. Most common is the belief that the individual emits a foul odor; that there is an in-\nfestation of insects on or in the skin; that there is an internal parasite; that certain parts of\nthe body are misshapen or ugly; or that parts of the body are not functioning.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of delusional disorder is the presence of one or more delusions that\npersist for at least 1 month (Criterion A). A diagnosis of delusional disorder is not given if\nthe individual has ever had a symptom presentation that met Criterion A for schizophre-\nnia (Criterion B). Apart from the direct impact of the delusions, impairments in psychoso-\ncial functioning may be more circumscribed than those seen in other psychotic disorders\nsuch as schizophrenia, and behavior is not obviously bizarre or odd (Criterion C). If mood\nepisodes occur concurrently with the delusions, the total duration of these mood episodes\nis brief relative to the total duration of the delusional periods (Criterion D). The delusions\nare not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., cocaine) or another\nmedical condition (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease) and are not better explained by another men-\ntal disorder, such as body dysmorphic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (Crite-\nrion E).\nIn addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the\nassessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making crit-\nically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-\nchotic disorders.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nSocial, marital, or work problems can result from the delusional beliefs of delusional dis-\norder. Individuals with delusional disorder may be able to factually describe that others\nview their beliefs as irrational but are unable to accept this themselves (i.e., there may be\n“factual insight” but no true insight). Many individuals develop irritable or dysphoric\nmood, which can usually be understood as a reaction to their delusional beliefs. Anger and\nviolent behavior can occur with persecutory, jealous, and erotomanic types. The individ-\nual may engage in litigious or antagonistic behavior (e.g., sending hundreds of letters of\nprotest to the government). Legal difficulties can occur, particularly in jealous and eroto-\nmanic types. \nPrevalence\nThe lifetime prevalence of delusional disorder has been estimated at around 0.2%, and the\nmost frequent subtype is persecutory. Delusional disorder, jealous type, is probably more\ncommon in males than in females, but there are no major gender differences in the overall\nfrequency of delusional disorder.\nDevelopment and Course\nOn average, global function is generally better than that observed in schizophrenia. Al-\nthough the diagnosis is generally stable, a proportion of individuals go on to develop\nDelusional Disorder\n93\nschizophrenia. Delusional disorder has a significant familial relationship with both\nschizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder. Although it can occur in younger age\ngroups, the condition may be more prevalent in older individuals.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nAn individual’s cultural and religious background must be taken into account in evaluat-\ning the possible presence of delusional disorder. The content of delusions also varies\nacross cultural contexts.\nFunctional Consequences of Delusional Disorder\nThe functional impairment is usually more circumscribed than that seen with other psy-\nchotic disorders, although in some cases, the impairment may be substantial and include\npoor occupational functioning and social isolation. When poor psychosocial functioning is\npresent, delusional beliefs themselves often play a significant role. A common character-\nistic of individuals with delusional disorder is the apparent normality of their behavior\nand appearance when their delusional ideas are not being discussed or acted on. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nObsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nIf an individual with obsessive-compul-\nsive disorder is completely convinced that his or her obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs\nare true, then the diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder, with absent insight/delu-\nsional beliefs specifier, should be given rather than a diagnosis of delusional disorder.\nSimilarly, if an individual with body dysmorphic disorder is completely convinced that\nhis or her body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true, then the diagnosis of body dysmor-\nphic disorder, with absent insight/delusional beliefs specifier, should be given rather than\na diagnosis of delusional disorder. \nDelirium, major neurocognitive disorder, psychotic disorder due to another medical con-\ndition, and substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder.\nIndividuals with these\ndisorders may present with symptoms that suggest delusional disorder. For example, sim-\nple persecutory delusions in the context of major neurocognitive disorder would be di-\nagnosed as major neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral disturbance. A substance/\nmedication-induced psychotic disorder cross-sectionally may be identical in symptom-\natology to delusional disorder but can be distinguished by the chronological relationship\nof substance use to the onset and remission of the delusional beliefs.\nSchizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder.\nDelusional disorder can be distinguished\nfrom schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder by the absence of the other character-\nistic symptoms of the active phase of schizophrenia. \nDepressive and bipolar disorders and schizoaffective disorder.\nThese disorders may\nbe distinguished from delusional disorder by the temporal relationship between the mood\ndisturbance and the delusions and by the severity of the mood symptoms. If delusions oc-\ncur exclusively during mood episodes, the diagnosis is depressive or bipolar disorder with\npsychotic features. Mood symptoms that meet full criteria for a mood episode can be su-\nperimposed on delusional disorder. Delusional disorder can be diagnosed only if the total\nduration of all mood episodes remains brief relative to the total duration of the delusional\ndisturbance. If not, then a diagnosis of other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spec-\ntrum and other psychotic disorder accompanied by other specified depressive disorder,\nunspecified depressive disorder, other specified bipolar and related disorder, or unspeci-\nfied bipolar and related disorder is appropriate.\n94\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders", "provenance": {"source_file": "schizophrenia_spectrum_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 1, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.526328"}}

(See Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom\nSeverity in the chapter “Assessment Measures.”)\nNote: Diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder can be made without using this severity\nspecifier.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of brief psychotic disorder is a disturbance that involves the sudden\nonset of at least one of the following positive psychotic symptoms: delusions, hallucina-\ntions, disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence), or grossly abnormal\npsychomotor behavior, including catatonia (Criterion A). Sudden onset is defined as\nchange from a nonpsychotic state to a clearly psychotic state within 2 weeks, usually with-\nout a prodrome. An episode of the disturbance lasts at least 1 day but less than 1 month,\nand the individual eventually has a full return to the premorbid level of functioning (Cri-\nBrief Psychotic Disorder\n95\nterion B). The disturbance is not better explained by a depressive or bipolar disorder with\npsychotic features, by schizoaffective disorder, or by schizophrenia and is not attributable\nto the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a hallucinogen) or another medical condi-\ntion (e.g., subdural hematoma) (Criterion C).\nIn addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the\nassessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making crit-\nically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-\nchotic disorders.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with brief psychotic disorder typically experience emotional turmoil or over-\nwhelming confusion. They may have rapid shifts from one intense affect to another.\nAlthough the disturbance is brief, the level of impairment may be severe, and supervision\nmay be required to ensure that nutritional and hygienic needs are met and that the indi-\nvidual is protected from the consequences of poor judgment, cognitive impairment, or act-\ning on the basis of delusions. There appears to be an increased risk of suicidal behavior,\nparticularly during the acute episode.\nPrevalence\nIn the United States, brief psychotic disorder may account for 9% of cases of first-onset\npsychosis. Psychotic disturbances that meet Criteria A and C, but not Criterion B, for brief\npsychotic disorder (i.e., duration of active symptoms is 1–6 months as opposed to remis-\nsion within 1 month) are more common in developing countries than in developed coun-\ntries. Brief psychotic disorder is twofold more common in females than in males.\nDevelopment and Course\nBrief psychotic disorder may appear in adolescence or early adulthood, and onset can oc-\ncur across the lifespan, with the average age at onset being the mid 30s. By definition, a\ndiagnosis of brief psychotic disorder requires a full remission of all symptoms and an\neventual full return to the premorbid level of functioning within 1 month of the onset of the\ndisturbance. In some individuals, the duration of psychotic symptoms may be quite brief\n(e.g., a few days).\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nTemperamental.\n Preexisting personality disorders and traits (e.g., schizotypal person-\nality disorder; borderline personality disorder; or traits in the psychoticism domain, such\nas perceptual dysregulation, and the negative affectivity domain, such as suspiciousness)\nmay predispose the individual to the development of the disorder.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nIt is important to distinguish symptoms of brief psychotic disorder from culturally sanc-\ntioned response patterns. For example, in some religious ceremonies, an individual may\nreport hearing voices, but these do not generally persist and are not perceived as abnormal\nby most members of the individual’s community. In addition, cultural and religious back-\nground must be taken into account when considering whether beliefs are delusional. \nFunctional Consequences of Brief Psychotic Disorder\nDespite high rates of relapse, for most individuals, outcome is excellent in terms of social\nfunctioning and symptomatology.\n96\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther medical conditions.\nA variety of medical disorders can manifest with psychotic\nsymptoms of short duration. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition or a de-\nlirium is diagnosed when there is evidence from the history, physical examination, or lab-\noratory tests that the delusions or hallucinations are the direct physiological consequence\nof a specific medical condition (e.g., Cushing’s syndrome, brain tumor) (see “Psychotic\nDisorder Due to Another Medical Condition” later in this chapter). \nSubstance-related disorders.\nSubstance/medication-induced psychotic disorder, sub-\nstance-induced delirium, and substance intoxication are distinguished from brief psychotic\ndisorder by the fact that a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, exposure to a toxin)\nis judged to be etiologically related to the psychotic symptoms (see “Substance/Medication-\nInduced Psychotic Disorder” later in this chapter). Laboratory tests, such as a urine drug\nscreen or a blood alcohol level, may be helpful in making this determination, as may a care-\nful history of substance use with attention to temporal relationships between substance in-\ntake and onset of the symptoms and to the nature of the substance being used.\nDepressive and bipolar disorders.\nThe diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder cannot be\nmade if the psychotic symptoms are better explained by a mood episode (i.e., the psychotic\nsymptoms occur exclusively during a full major depressive, manic, or mixed episode). \nOther psychotic disorders.\nIf the psychotic symptoms persist for 1 month or longer, the\ndiagnosis is either schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, depressive disorder\nwith psychotic features, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, or other specified or un-\nspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, depending on the other\nsymptoms in the presentation. The differential diagnosis between brief psychotic disorder\nand schizophreniform disorder is difficult when the psychotic symptoms have remitted be-\nfore 1 month in response to successful treatment with medication. Careful attention should\nbe given to the possibility that a recurrent disorder (e.g., bipolar disorder, recurrent acute ex-\nacerbations of schizophrenia) may be responsible for any recurring psychotic episodes.\nMalingering and factitious disorders.\nAn episode of factitious disorder, with predomi-\nnantly psychological signs and symptoms, may have the appearance of brief psychotic\ndisorder, but in such cases there is evidence that the symptoms are intentionally produced.\nWhen malingering involves apparently psychotic symptoms, there is usually evidence\nthat the illness is being feigned for an understandable goal.\nPersonality disorders.\nIn certain individuals with personality disorders, psychosocial\nstressors may precipitate brief periods of psychotic symptoms. These symptoms are usu-\nally transient and do not warrant a separate diagnosis. If psychotic symptoms persist for at\nleast 1 day, an additional diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder may be appropriate.", "provenance": {"source_file": "schizophrenia_spectrum_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 2, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.526328"}}

Schizophreniform disorder is distinguished by its difference in du-\nration: the total duration of the illness, including prodromal, active, and residual phases, is\nat least 1 month but less than 6 months (Criterion B). The duration requirement for schizo-\nphreniform disorder is intermediate between that for brief psychotic disorder, which lasts\nmore than 1 day and remits by 1 month, and schizophrenia, which lasts for at least 6 months.\nThe diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is made under two conditions. 1) when an ep-\nisode of illness lasts between 1 and 6 months and the individual has already recovered,\nand 2) when an individual is symptomatic for less than the 6 months’ duration required for\nthe diagnosis of schizophrenia but has not yet recovered. In this case, the diagnosis should\nbe noted as “schizophreniform disorder (provisional)” because it is uncertain if the indi-\nvidual will recover from the disturbance within the 6-month period. If the disturbance per-\nsists beyond 6 months, the diagnosis should be changed to schizophrenia.\n98\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\nAnother distinguishing feature of schizophreniform disorder is the lack of a criterion\nrequiring impaired social and occupational functioning. While such impairments may po-\ntentially be present, they are not necessary for a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder. \nIn addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the\nassessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making crit-\nically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-\nchotic disorders.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nAs with schizophrenia, currently there are no laboratory or psychometric tests for schizo-\nphreniform disorder. There are multiple brain regions where neuroimaging, neuropa-\nthological, and neurophysiological research has indicated abnormalities, but none are\ndiagnostic.\nPrevalence\nIncidence of schizophreniform disorder across sociocultural settings is likely similar to\nthat observed in schizophrenia. In the United States and other developed countries, the in-\ncidence is low, possibly fivefold less than that of schizophrenia. In developing countries,\nthe incidence may be higher, especially for the specifier “with good prognostic features”;\nin some of these settings schizophreniform disorder may be as common as schizophrenia. \nDevelopment and Course\nThe development of schizophreniform disorder is similar to that of schizophrenia. About\none-third of individuals with an initial diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder (provi-\nsional) recover within the 6-month period and schizophreniform disorder is their final di-\nagnosis. The majority of the remaining two-thirds of individuals will eventually receive a\ndiagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nGenetic and physiological.\nRelatives of individuals with schizophreniform disorder\nhave an increased risk for schizophrenia. \nFunctional Consequences of \nSchizophreniform Disorder\nFor the majority of individuals with schizophreniform disorder who eventually receive a\ndiagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the functional consequences are\nsimilar to the consequences of those disorders. Most individuals experience dysfunction in\nseveral areas of daily functioning, such as school or work, interpersonal relationships, and\nself-care. Individuals who recover from schizophreniform disorder have better functional\noutcomes. \nDifferential Diagnosis \nOther mental disorders and medical conditions.\nA wide variety of mental and medical\nconditions can manifest with psychotic symptoms that must be considered in the differ-\nential diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder. These include psychotic disorder due to\nanother medical condition or its treatment; delirium or major neurocognitive disorder;\nsubstance/medication-induced psychotic disorder or delirium; depressive or bipolar\ndisorder with psychotic features; schizoaffective disorder; other specified or unspecified bi-\npolar and related disorder; depressive or bipolar disorder with catatonic features; schizophre-\nSchizophrenia\n99\nnia; brief psychotic disorder; delusional disorder; other specified or unspecified schizo-\nphrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder; schizotypal, schizoid, or paranoid\npersonality disorders; autism spectrum disorder; disorders presenting in childhood with\ndisorganized speech; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; obsessive-compulsive dis-\norder; posttraumatic stress disorder; and traumatic brain injury.\nSince the diagnostic criteria for schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia differ\nprimarily in duration of illness, the discussion of the differential diagnosis of schizophre-\nnia also applies to schizophreniform disorder.\nBrief psychotic disorder.\nSchizophreniform disorder differs in duration from brief psy-\nchotic disorder, which has a duration of less than 1 month.", "provenance": {"source_file": "schizophrenia_spectrum_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 3, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.527324"}}

At least one of these symptoms must be the clear pres-\nence of delusions (Criterion A1), hallucinations (Criterion A2), or disorganized speech\n(Criterion A3). Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior (Criterion A4) and negative\nsymptoms (Criterion A5) may also be present. In those situations in which the active-\nphase symptoms remit within a month in response to treatment, Criterion A is still met if the\nclinician estimates that they would have persisted in the absence of treatment. \nSchizophrenia involves impairment in one or more major areas of functioning (Crite-\nrion B). If the disturbance begins in childhood or adolescence, the expected level of func-\ntion is not attained. Comparing the individual with unaffected siblings may be helpful. The\ndysfunction persists for a substantial period during the course of the disorder and does not\nappear to be a direct result of any single feature. Avolition (i.e., reduced drive to pursue\ngoal-directed behavior; Criterion A5) is linked to the social dysfunction described under\nCriterion B. There is also strong evidence for a relationship between cognitive impairment\n(see the section “Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis” for this disorder) and func-\ntional impairment in individuals with schizophrenia.\nSchizophrenia\n101\nSome signs of the disturbance must persist for a continuous period of at least 6 months\n(Criterion C). Prodromal symptoms often precede the active phase, and residual symp-\ntoms may follow it, characterized by mild or subthreshold forms of hallucinations or\ndelusions. Individuals may express a variety of unusual or odd beliefs that are not of de-\nlusional proportions (e.g., ideas of reference or magical thinking); they may have unusual\nperceptual experiences (e.g., sensing the presence of an unseen person); their speech may\nbe generally understandable but vague; and their behavior may be unusual but not grossly\ndisorganized (e.g., mumbling in public). Negative symptoms are common in the pro-\ndromal and residual phases and can be severe. Individuals who had been socially active\nmay become withdrawn from previous routines. Such behaviors are often the first sign of\na disorder.\nMood symptoms and full mood episodes are common in schizophrenia and may be con-\ncurrent with active-phase symptomatology. However, as distinct from a psychotic mood dis-\norder, a schizophrenia diagnosis requires the presence of delusions or hallucinations in the\nabsence of mood episodes. In addition, mood episodes, taken in total, should be present for\nonly a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.\nIn addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the\nassessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making crit-\nically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-\nchotic disorders.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with schizophrenia may display inappropriate affect (e.g., laughing in the ab-\nsence of an appropriate stimulus); a dysphoric mood that can take the form of depression,\nanxiety, or anger; a disturbed sleep pattern (e.g., daytime sleeping and nighttime activity);\nand a lack of interest in eating or food refusal. Depersonalization, derealization, and so-\nmatic concerns may occur and sometimes reach delusional proportions. Anxiety and pho-\nbias are common. Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are common and are strongly linked\nto vocational and functional impairments. These deficits can include decrements in declar-\native memory, working memory, language function, and other executive functions, as well\nas slower processing speed. Abnormalities in sensory processing and inhibitory capacity,\nas well as reductions in attention, are also found. Some individuals with schizophrenia\nshow social cognition deficits, including deficits in the ability to infer the intentions of\nother people (theory of mind), and may attend to and then interpret irrelevant events or\nstimuli as meaningful, perhaps leading to the generation of explanatory delusions. These\nimpairments frequently persist during symptomatic remission.\nSome individuals with psychosis may lack insight or awareness of their disorder (i.e.,\nanosognosia). This lack of “insight” includes unawareness of symptoms of schizophrenia\nand may be present throughout the entire course of the illness. Unawareness of illness is\ntypically a symptom of schizophrenia itself rather than a coping strategy. It is comparable\nto the lack of awareness of neurological deficits following brain damage, termed anoso-\ngnosia. This symptom is the most common predictor of non-adherence to treatment, and it\npredicts higher relapse rates, increased number of involuntary treatments, poorer psycho-\nsocial functioning, aggression, and a poorer course of illness. \nHostility and aggression can be associated with schizophrenia, although spontaneous\nor random assault is uncommon. Aggression is more frequent for younger males and for\nindividuals with a past history of violence, non-adherence with treatment, substance\nabuse, and impulsivity. It should be noted that the vast majority of persons with schizo-\nphrenia are not aggressive and are more frequently victimized than are individuals in the\ngeneral population. \nCurrently, there are no radiological, laboratory, or psychometric tests for the disorder.\nDifferences are evident in multiple brain regions between groups of healthy individuals\n102\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\nand persons with schizophrenia, including evidence from neuroimaging, neuropatholog-\nical, and neurophysiological studies. Differences are also evident in cellular architecture,\nwhite matter connectivity, and gray matter volume in a variety of regions such as the pre-\nfrontal and temporal cortices. Reduced overall brain volume has been observed, as well as\nincreased brain volume reduction with age. Brain volume reductions with age are more\npronounced in individuals with schizophrenia than in healthy individuals. Finally, indi-\nviduals with schizophrenia appear to differ from individuals without the disorder in eye-\ntracking and electrophysiological indices.\nNeurological soft signs common in individuals with schizophrenia include impairments\nin motor coordination, sensory integration, and motor sequencing of complex movements;\nleft-right confusion; and disinhibition of associated movements. In addition, minor phys-\nical anomalies of the face and limbs may occur.\nPrevalence\nThe lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia appears to be approximately 0.3%–0.7%, al-\nthough there is reported variation by race/ethnicity, across countries, and by geographic\norigin for immigrants and children of immigrants. The sex ratio differs across samples and\npopulations: for example, an emphasis on negative symptoms and longer duration of dis-\norder (associated with poorer outcome) shows higher incidence rates for males, whereas\ndefinitions allowing for the inclusion of more mood symptoms and brief presentations\n(associated with better outcome) show equivalent risks for both sexes. \nDevelopment and Course\nThe psychotic features of schizophrenia typically emerge between the late teens and the\nmid-30s; onset prior to adolescence is rare. The peak age at onset for the first psychotic ep-\nisode is in the early- to mid-20s for males and in the late-20s for females. The onset may be\nabrupt or insidious, but the majority of individuals manifest a slow and gradual develop-\nment of a variety of clinically significant signs and symptoms. Half of these individuals\ncomplain of depressive symptoms. Earlier age at onset has traditionally been seen as a pre-\ndictor of worse prognosis. However, the effect of age at onset is likely related to gender,\nwith males having worse premorbid adjustment, lower educational achievement, more\nprominent negative symptoms and cognitive impairment, and in general a worse out-\ncome. Impaired cognition is common, and alterations in cognition are present during de-\nvelopment and precede the emergence of psychosis, taking the form of stable cognitive\nimpairments during adulthood. Cognitive impairments may persist when other symptoms\nare in remission and contribute to the disability of the disease. \nThe predictors of course and outcome are largely unexplained, and course and outcome\nmay not be reliably predicted. The course appears to be favorable in about 20% of those\nwith schizophrenia, and a small number of individuals are reported to recover completely.\nHowever, most individuals with schizophrenia still require formal or informal daily living\nsupports, and many remain chronically ill, with exacerbations and remissions of active\nsymptoms, while others have a course of progressive deterioration.\nPsychotic symptoms tend to diminish over the life course, perhaps in association with\nnormal age-related declines in dopamine activity. Negative symptoms are more closely re-\nlated to prognosis than are positive symptoms and tend to be the most persistent. Further-\nmore, cognitive deficits associated with the illness may not improve over the course of the\nillness.\nThe essential features of schizophrenia are the same in childhood, but it is more diffi-\ncult to make the diagnosis. In children, delusions and hallucinations may be less elaborate\nthan in adults, and visual hallucinations are more common and should be distinguished\nfrom normal fantasy play. Disorganized speech occurs in many disorders with childhood\nonset (e.g., autism spectrum disorder), as does disorganized behavior (e.g., attention-deficit/\nSchizophrenia\n103\nhyperactivity disorder). These symptoms should not be attributed to schizophrenia with-\nout due consideration of the more common disorders of childhood. Childhood-onset cases\ntend to resemble poor-outcome adult cases, with gradual onset and prominent negative\nsymptoms. Children who later receive the diagnosis of schizophrenia are more likely to\nhave experienced nonspecific emotional-behavioral disturbances and psychopathology,\nintellectual and language alterations, and subtle motor delays.\nLate-onset cases (i.e., onset after age 40 years) are overrepresented by females, who\nmay have married. Often, the course is characterized by a predominance of psychotic\nsymptoms with preservation of affect and social functioning. Such late-onset cases can still\nmeet the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, but it is not yet clear whether this is the\nsame condition as schizophrenia diagnosed prior to mid-life (e.g., prior to age 55 years).\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nEnvironmental.\nSeason of birth has been linked to the incidence of schizophrenia, in-\ncluding late winter/early spring in some locations and summer for the deficit form of the\ndisease. The incidence of schizophrenia and related disorders is higher for children grow-\ning up in an urban environment and for some minority ethnic groups. \nGenetic and physiological.\nThere is a strong contribution for genetic factors in deter-\nmining risk for schizophrenia, although most individuals who have been diagnosed with\nschizophrenia have no family history of psychosis. Liability is conferred by a spectrum of\nrisk alleles, common and rare, with each allele contributing only a small fraction to the to-\ntal population variance. The risk alleles identified to date are also associated with other\nmental disorders, including bipolar disorder, depression, and autism spectrum disorder.\nPregnancy and birth complications with hypoxia and greater paternal age are associated\nwith a higher risk of schizophrenia for the developing fetus. In addition, other prenatal\nand perinatal adversities, including stress, infection, malnutrition, maternal diabetes, and\nother medical conditions, have been linked with schizophrenia. However, the vast major-\nity of offspring with these risk factors do not develop schizophrenia. \nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues \nCultural and socioeconomic factors must be considered, particularly when the individual\nand the clinician do not share the same cultural and socioeconomic background. Ideas that\nappear to be delusional in one culture (e.g., witchcraft) may be commonly held in another.\nIn some cultures, visual or auditory hallucinations with a religious content (e.g., hearing\nGod’s voice) are a normal part of religious experience. In addition, the assessment of dis-\norganized speech may be made difficult by linguistic variation in narrative styles across\ncultures. The assessment of affect requires sensitivity to differences in styles of emotional\nexpression, eye contact, and body language, which vary across cultures. If the assessment\nis conducted in a language that is different from the individual’s primary language, care\nmust be taken to ensure that alogia is not related to linguistic barriers. In certain cultures,\ndistress may take the form of hallucinations or pseudo-hallucinations and overvalued\nideas that may present clinically similar to true psychosis but are normative to the pa-\ntient’s subgroup.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues \nA number of features distinguish the clinical expression of schizophrenia in females and\nmales. The general incidence of schizophrenia tends to be slightly lower in females, par-\nticularly among treated cases. The age at onset is later in females, with a second mid-life\npeak as described earlier (see the section “Development and Course” for this disorder).\nSymptoms tend to be more affect-laden among females, and there are more psychotic\nsymptoms, as well as a greater propensity for psychotic symptoms to worsen in later life.\n104\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\nOther symptom differences include less frequent negative symptoms and disorganization.\nFinally, social functioning tends to remain better preserved in females. There are, how-\never, frequent exceptions to these general caveats. \nSuicide Risk \nApproximately 5%–6% of individuals with schizophrenia die by suicide, about 20% attempt\nsuicide on one or more occasions, and many more have significant suicidal ideation. Suicidal\nbehavior is sometimes in response to command hallucinations to harm oneself or others.\nSuicide risk remains high over the whole lifespan for males and females, although it may be\nespecially high for younger males with comorbid substance use. Other risk factors include\nhaving depressive symptoms or feelings of hopelessness and being unemployed, and the\nrisk is higher, also, in the period after a psychotic episode or hospital discharge.\nFunctional Consequences of Schizophrenia \nSchizophrenia is associated with significant social and occupational dysfunction. Making\neducational progress and maintaining employment are frequently impaired by avolition\nor other disorder manifestations, even when the cognitive skills are sufficient for the tasks\nat hand. Most individuals are employed at a lower level than their parents, and most, par-\nticularly men, do not marry or have limited social contacts outside of their family.\nDifferential Diagnosis \nMajor depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic or catatonic features.\nThe distinc-\ntion between schizophrenia and major depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic\nfeatures or with catatonia depends on the temporal relationship between the mood distur-\nbance and the psychosis, and on the severity of the depressive or manic symptoms. If de-\nlusions or hallucinations occur exclusively during a major depressive or manic episode,\nthe diagnosis is depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features. \nSchizoaffective disorder.\nA diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that a major\ndepressive or manic episode occur concurrently with the active-phase symptoms and that\nthe mood symptoms be present for a majority of the total duration of the active periods.\nSchizophreniform disorder and brief psychotic disorder.\nThese disorders are of shorter\nduration than schizophrenia as specified in Criterion C, which requires 6 months of symp-\ntoms. In schizophreniform disorder, the disturbance is present less than 6 months, and in\nbrief psychotic disorder, symptoms are present at least 1 day but less than 1 month. \nDelusional disorder.\nDelusional disorder can be distinguished from schizophrenia by\nthe absence of the other symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia (e.g., delusions, prom-\ninent auditory or visual hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or cata-\ntonic behavior, negative symptoms).\nSchizotypal personality disorder.\nSchizotypal personality disorder may be distinguished\nfrom schizophrenia by subthreshold symptoms that are associated with persistent person-\nality features.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder.\nIndividuals with\nobsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder may present with poor or\nabsent insight, and the preoccupations may reach delusional proportions. But these\ndisorders are distinguished from schizophrenia by their prominent obsessions, compul-\nsions, preoccupations with appearance or body odor, hoarding, or body-focused repeti-\ntive behaviors.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder may include flashbacks that\nhave a hallucinatory quality, and hypervigilance may reach paranoid proportions. But a trau-\nSchizoaffective Disorder\n105\nmatic event and characteristic symptom features relating to reliving or reacting to the event\nare required to make the diagnosis. \nAutism spectrum disorder or communication disorders.\nThese disorders may also have\nsymptoms resembling a psychotic episode but are distinguished by their respective defi-\ncits in social interaction with repetitive and restricted behaviors and other cognitive and\ncommunication deficits. An individual with autism spectrum disorder or communication\ndisorder must have symptoms that meet full criteria for schizophrenia, with prominent\nhallucinations or delusions for at least 1 month, in order to be diagnosed with schizophre-\nnia as a comorbid condition.\nOther mental disorders associated with a psychotic episode.\nThe diagnosis of schizo-\nphrenia is made only when the psychotic episode is persistent and not attributable to the\nphysiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. Individuals with a de-\nlirium or major or minor neurocognitive disorder may present with psychotic symptoms,\nbut these would have a temporal relationship to the onset of cognitive changes consistent\nwith those disorders. Individuals with substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder\nmay present with symptoms characteristic of Criterion A for schizophrenia, but the sub-\nstance/medication-induced psychotic disorder can usually be distinguished by the chron-\nological relationship of substance use to the onset and remission of the psychosis in the\nabsence of substance use. \nComorbidity \nRates of comorbidity with substance-related disorders are high in schizophrenia. Over\nhalf of individuals with schizophrenia have tobacco use disorder and smoke cigarettes\nregularly. Comorbidity with anxiety disorders is increasingly recognized in schizophre-\nnia. Rates of obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder are elevated in individuals\nwith schizophrenia compared with the general population. Schizotypal or paranoid per-\nsonality disorder may sometimes precede the onset of schizophrenia.\nLife expectancy is reduced in individuals with schizophrenia because of associated\nmedical conditions. Weight gain, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular and\npulmonary disease are more common in schizophrenia than in the general population.\nPoor engagement in health maintenance behaviors (e.g., cancer screening, exercise) in-\ncreases the risk of chronic disease, but other disorder factors, including medications, life-\nstyle, cigarette smoking, and diet, may also play a role. A shared vulnerability for\npsychosis and medical disorders may explain some of the medical comorbidity of schizo-\nphrenia.", "provenance": {"source_file": "schizophrenia_spectrum_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 4, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.527324"}}

The diagnosis is usually, but not necessarily, made during the\nperiod of psychotic illness. At some time during the period, Criterion A for schizophrenia\nSchizoaffective Disorder\n107\nhas to be met. Criteria B (social dysfunction) and F (exclusion of autism spectrum disorder\nor other communication disorder of childhood onset) for schizophrenia do not have to be\nmet. In addition to meeting Criterion A for schizophrenia, there is a major mood episode\n(major depressive or manic) (Criterion A for schizoaffective disorder). Because loss of in-\nterest or pleasure is common in schizophrenia, to meet Criterion A for schizoaffective dis-\norder, the major depressive episode must include pervasive depressed mood (i.e., the\npresence of markedly diminished interest or pleasure is not sufficient). Episodes of de-\npression or mania are present for the majority of the total duration of the illness (i.e., after\nCriterion A has been met) (Criterion C for schizoaffective disorder). To separate schizoaf-\nfective disorder from a depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, delusions\nor hallucinations must be present for at least 2 weeks in the absence of a major mood epi-\nsode (depressive or manic) at some point during the lifetime duration of the illness (Cri-\nterion B for schizoaffective disorder). The symptoms must not be attributable to the effects\nof a substance or another medical condition (Criterion D for schizoaffective disorder).\nCriterion C for schizoaffective disorder specifies that mood symptoms meeting criteria\nfor a major mood episode must be present for the majority of the total duration of the ac-\ntive and residual portion of the illness. Criterion C requires the assessment of mood symp-\ntoms for the entire course of a psychotic illness, which differs from the criterion in DSM-IV,\nwhich required only an assessment of the current period of illness. If the mood symptoms\nare present for only a relatively brief period, the diagnosis is schizophrenia, not schizoaf-\nfective disorder. When deciding whether an individual’s presentation meets Criterion C,\nthe clinician should review the total duration of psychotic illness (i.e., both active and re-\nsidual symptoms) and determine when significant mood symptoms (untreated or in need\nof treatment with antidepressant and/or mood-stabilizing medication) accompanied the\npsychotic symptoms. This determination requires sufficient historical information and\nclinical judgment. For example, an individual with a 4-year history of active and residual\nsymptoms of schizophrenia develops depressive and manic episodes that, taken together,\ndo not occupy more than 1 year during the 4-year history of psychotic illness. This presen-\ntation would not meet Criterion C.\nIn addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the\nassessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making crit-\nically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-\nchotic disorders.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nOccupational functioning is frequently impaired, but this is not a defining criterion (in\ncontrast to schizophrenia). Restricted social contact and difficulties with self-care are as-\nsociated with schizoaffective disorder, but negative symptoms may be less severe and less\npersistent than those seen in schizophrenia. Anosognosia (i.e., poor insight) is also com-\nmon in schizoaffective disorder, but the deficits in insight may be less severe and perva-\nsive than those in schizophrenia. Individuals with schizoaffective disorder may be at\nincreased risk for later developing episodes of major depressive disorder or bipolar disor-\nder if mood symptoms continue following the remission of symptoms meeting Criterion A\nfor schizophrenia. There may be associated alcohol and other substance-related disorders. \nThere are no tests or biological measures that can assist in making the diagnosis of\nschizoaffective disorder. Whether schizoaffective disorder differs from schizophrenia\nwith regard to associated features such as structural or functional brain abnormalities,\ncognitive deficits, or genetic risk factors is not clear.\nPrevalence\nSchizoaffective disorder appears to be about one-third as common as schizophrenia. Life-\ntime prevalence of schizoaffective disorder is estimated to be 0.3%. The incidence of\n108\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\nschizoaffective disorder is higher in females than in males, mainly due to an increased in-\ncidence of the depressive type among females.\nDevelopment and Course\nThe typical age at onset of schizoaffective disorder is early adulthood, although onset can\noccur anywhere from adolescence to late in life. A significant number of individuals diag-\nnosed with another psychotic illness initially will receive the diagnosis schizoaffective dis-\norder later when the pattern of mood episodes has become more apparent. With the\ncurrent diagnostic Criterion C, it is expected that the diagnosis for some individuals will\nconvert from schizoaffective disorder to another disorder as mood symptoms become less\nprominent. The prognosis for schizoaffective disorder is somewhat better than the prog-\nnosis for schizophrenia but worse than the prognosis for mood disorders. \nSchizoaffective disorder may occur in a variety of temporal patterns. The following is\na typical pattern: An individual may have pronounced auditory hallucinations and per-\nsecutory delusions for 2 months before the onset of a prominent major depressive episode.\nThe psychotic symptoms and the full major depressive episode are then present for 3 months.\nThen, the individual recovers completely from the major depressive episode, but the psy-\nchotic symptoms persist for another month before they too disappear. During this period\nof illness, the individual’s symptoms concurrently met criteria for a major depressive ep-\nisode and Criterion A for schizophrenia, and during this same period of illness, auditory\nhallucinations and delusions were present both before and after the depressive phase. The\ntotal period of illness lasted for about 6 months, with psychotic symptoms alone present\nduring the initial 2 months, both depressive and psychotic symptoms present during the\nnext 3 months, and psychotic symptoms alone present during the last month. In this in-\nstance, the duration of the depressive episode was not brief relative to the total duration of\nthe psychotic disturbance, and thus the presentation qualifies for a diagnosis of schizoaf-\nfective disorder.\nThe expression of psychotic symptoms across the lifespan is variable. Depressive or\nmanic symptoms can occur before the onset of psychosis, during acute psychotic episodes,\nduring residual periods, and after cessation of psychosis. For example, an individual\nmight present with prominent mood symptoms during the prodromal stage of schizo-\nphrenia. This pattern is not necessarily indicative of schizoaffective disorder, since it is the\nco-occurrence of psychotic and mood symptoms that is diagnostic. For an individual with\nsymptoms that clearly meet the criteria for schizoaffective disorder but who on further fol-\nlow-up only presents with residual psychotic symptoms (such as subthreshold psychosis\nand/or prominent negative symptoms), the diagnosis may be changed to schizophrenia,\nas the total proportion of psychotic illness compared with mood symptoms becomes more\nprominent. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, may be more common in young adults,\nwhereas schizoaffective disorder, depressive type, may be more common in older adults. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nGenetic and physiological.\nAmong individuals with schizophrenia, there may be an in-\ncreased risk for schizoaffective disorder in first-degree relatives. The risk for schizoaffec-\ntive disorder may be increased among individuals who have a first-degree relative with\nschizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. \nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues \nCultural and socioeconomic factors must be considered, particularly when the individual\nand the clinician do not share the same cultural and economic background. Ideas that ap-\npear to be delusional in one culture (e.g., witchcraft) may be commonly held in another.\nThere is also some evidence in the literature for the overdiagnosis of schizophrenia com-\nSchizoaffective Disorder\n109\npared with schizoaffective disorder in African American and Hispanic populations, so\ncare must be taken to ensure a culturally appropriate evaluation that includes both psy-\nchotic and affective symptoms.\nSuicide Risk \nThe lifetime risk of suicide for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder is 5%, and the\npresence of depressive symptoms is correlated with a higher risk for suicide. There is ev-\nidence that suicide rates are higher in North American populations than in European,\nEastern European, South American, and Indian populations of individuals with schizo-\nphrenia or schizoaffective disorder.\nFunctional Consequences of Schizoaffective Disorder\nSchizoaffective disorder is associated with social and occupational dysfunction, but dys-\nfunction is not a diagnostic criterion (as it is for schizophrenia), and there is substantial\nvariability between individuals diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther mental disorders and medical conditions.\nA wide variety of psychiatric and med-\nical conditions can manifest with psychotic and mood symptoms that must be considered\nin the differential diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. These include psychotic disorder\ndue to another medical condition; delirium; major neurocognitive disorder; substance/\nmedication-induced psychotic disorder or neurocognitive disorder; bipolar disorders\nwith psychotic features; major depressive disorder with psychotic features; depressive or\nbipolar disorders with catatonic features; schizotypal, schizoid, or paranoid personality\ndisorder; brief psychotic disorder; schizophreniform disorder; schizophrenia; delusional\ndisorder; and other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic\ndisorders. Medical conditions and substance use can present with a combination of psy-\nchotic and mood symptoms, and thus psychotic disorder due to another medical condition\nneeds to be excluded. Distinguishing schizoaffective disorder from schizophrenia and\nfrom depressive and bipolar disorders with psychotic features is often difficult. Criterion\nC is designed to separate schizoaffective disorder from schizophrenia, and Criterion B is\ndesigned to distinguish schizoaffective disorder from a depressive or bipolar disorder\nwith psychotic features. More specifically, schizoaffective disorder can be distinguished\nfrom a depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features due to the presence of prom-\ninent delusions and/or hallucinations for at least 2 weeks in the absence of a major mood\nepisode. In contrast, in depressive or bipolar disorders with psychotic features, the psy-\nchotic features primarily occur during the mood episode(s). Because the relative propor-\ntion of mood to psychotic symptoms may change over time, the appropriate diagnosis\nmay change from and to schizoaffective disorder (e.g., a diagnosis of schizoaffective dis-\norder for a severe and prominent major depressive episode lasting 3 months during the\nfirst 6 months of a persistent psychotic illness would be changed to schizophrenia if active\npsychotic or prominent residual symptoms persist over several years without a recurrence\nof another mood episode).\nPsychotic disorder due to another medical condition.\nOther medical conditions and\nsubstance use can manifest with a combination of psychotic and mood symptoms, and\nthus psychotic disorder due to another medical condition needs to be excluded. \nSchizophrenia, bipolar, and depressive disorders.\nDistinguishing schizoaffective dis-\norder from schizophrenia and from depressive and bipolar disorders with psychotic fea-\ntures is often difficult. Criterion C is designed to separate schizoaffective disorder from\nschizophrenia, and Criterion B is designed to distinguish schizoaffective disorder from a\n110\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\ndepressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features. More specifically, schizoaffective\ndisorder can be distinguished from a depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features\nbased on the presence of prominent delusions and/or hallucinations for at least 2 weeks in\nthe absence of a major mood episode. In contrast, in depressive or bipolar disorder with\npsychotic features, the psychotic features primarily occur during the mood episode(s). Be-\ncause the relative proportion of mood to psychotic symptoms may change over time, the\nappropriate diagnosis may change from and to schizoaffective disorder.

Note that the ICD-10-\nCM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present\nfor the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the sub-\nstance-induced psychotic disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should\nrecord “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced psychotic disorder\n(e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced psychotic disorder”). If a moderate or\nsevere substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced psychotic disor-\nder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance]\nuse disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the co-\nmorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after\na one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the cli-\nnician should record only the substance-induced psychotic disorder.\nSpecify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders” for diag-\nnoses associated with substance class):\nWith onset during intoxication: If the criteria are met for intoxication with the sub-\nstance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.\nWith onset during withdrawal: If the criteria are met for withdrawal from the sub-\nstance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.\nSpecify current severity:\nSeverity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psychosis,\nincluding delusions, hallucinations, abnormal psychomotor behavior, and negative\nsymptoms. Each of these symptoms may be rated for its current severity (most severe\nin the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and\nsevere).

The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in\nthe criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of\nthe classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in\ncases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of sub-\nstance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used.\nThe name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during in-\ntoxication, onset during withdrawal). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM,\nwhich combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single\ncode, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For\nexample, in the case of delusions occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe co-\ncaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.9 cocaine-induced psychotic disorder, with onset\nduring intoxication. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use disorder is also\ngiven. When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development\nof psychotic symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., 292.9 cannabis-induced psy-\nchotic disorder with onset during intoxication, with severe cannabis use disorder; 292.9\nphencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during intoxication, with mild\nphencyclidine use disorder).\nICD-10-CM.\nThe name of the substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder begins\nwith the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing\nthe delusions or hallucinations. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in\nthe criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid\nsubstance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexa-\nmethasone), the code for “other substance” with no comorbid substance use should be\nused; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific\nclass of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” with no comorbid sub-\nstance use should be used.\nWhen recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any)\nis listed first, followed by the word “with,” followed by the name of the substance-induced\npsychotic disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication,\nonset during withdrawal). For example, in the case of delusions occurring during intoxi-\ncation in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14.259 severe cocaine\nuse disorder with cocaine-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during intoxication. A\nseparate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the sub-\nstance-induced psychotic disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder\n(e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disor-\nder is noted (e.g., F16.959 phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during in-\ntoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the\ndevelopment of psychotic symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., F12.259 severe\ncannabis use disorder with cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during intox-\nication; F16.159 mild phencyclidine use disorder with phencyclidine-induced psychotic\ndisorder, with onset during intoxication).\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential features of substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder are prominent\ndelusions and/or hallucinations (Criterion A) that are judged to be due to the physiolog-\nical effects of a substance/medication (i.e., a drug of abuse, a medication, or a toxin expo-\nsure) (Criterion B). Hallucinations that the individual realizes are substance/medication-\ninduced are not included here and instead would be diagnosed as substance intoxication\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder\n113\nor substance withdrawal with the accompanying specifier “with perceptual disturbances”\n(applies to alcohol withdrawal; cannabis intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic\nwithdrawal; and stimulant intoxication).\nA substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder is distinguished from a primary\npsychotic disorder by considering the onset, course, and other factors. For drugs of abuse,\nthere must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of\nsubstance use, intoxication, or withdrawal. Substance/medication-induced psychotic\ndisorders arise during or soon after exposure to a medication or after substance intoxica-\ntion or withdrawal but can persist for weeks, whereas primary psychotic disorders may\nprecede the onset of substance/medication use or may occur during times of sustained ab-\nstinence. Once initiated, the psychotic symptoms may continue as long as the substance/\nmedication use continues. Another consideration is the presence of features that are atyp-\nical of a primary psychotic disorder (e.g., atypical age at onset or course). For example, the\nappearance of delusions de novo in a person older than 35 years without a known history\nof a primary psychotic disorder should suggest the possibility of a substance/medication-\ninduced psychotic disorder. Even a prior history of a primary psychotic disorder does not\nrule out the possibility of a substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. In contrast,\nfactors that suggest that the psychotic symptoms are better accounted for by a primary\npsychotic disorder include persistence of psychotic symptoms for a substantial period of\ntime (i.e., a month or more) after the end of substance intoxication or acute substance with-\ndrawal or after cessation of medication use; or a history of prior recurrent primary psy-\nchotic disorders. Other causes of psychotic symptoms must be considered even in an\nindividual with substance intoxication or withdrawal, because substance use problems are\nnot uncommon among individuals with non-substance/medication-induced psychotic\ndisorders. \nIn addition to the four symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the\nassessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making crit-\nically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-\nchotic disorders.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis \nPsychotic disorders can occur in association with intoxication with the following classes of\nsubstances: alcohol; cannabis; hallucinogens, including phencyclidine and related sub-\nstances; inhalants; sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics; stimulants (including cocaine);\nand other (or unknown) substances. Psychotic disorders can occur in association with with-\ndrawal from the following classes of substances: alcohol; sedatives, hypnotics, and anxio-\nlytics; and other (or unknown) substances. \nSome of the medications reported to evoke psychotic symptoms include anesthetics\nand analgesics, anticholinergic agents, anticonvulsants, antihistamines, antihypertensive\nand cardiovascular medications, antimicrobial medications, antiparkinsonian medica-\ntions, chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., cyclosporine, procarbazine), corticosteroids, gastro-\nintestinal medications, muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications,\nother over-the-counter medications (e.g., phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine), antidepres-\nsant medication, and disulfiram. Toxins reported to induce psychotic symptoms include\nanticholinesterase, organophosphate insecticides, sarin and other nerve gases, carbon\nmonoxide, carbon dioxide, and volatile substances such as fuel or paint.\nPrevalence\nPrevalence of substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder in the general popula-\ntion is unknown. Between 7% and 25% of individuals presenting with a first episode of\npsychosis in different settings are reported to have substance/medication-induced psy-\nchotic disorder. \n114\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\nDevelopment and Course\nThe initiation of the disorder may vary considerably with the substance. For example,\nsmoking a high dose of cocaine may produce psychosis within minutes, whereas days or\nweeks of high-dose alcohol or sedative use may be required to produce psychosis. Alco-\nhol-induced psychotic disorder, with hallucinations, usually occurs only after prolonged,\nheavy ingestion of alcohol in individuals who have moderate to severe alcohol use disorder,\nand the hallucinations are generally auditory in nature.\nPsychotic disorders induced by amphetamine and cocaine share similar clinical fea-\ntures. Persecutory delusions may rapidly develop shortly after use of amphetamine or a\nsimilarly acting sympathomimetic. The hallucination of bugs or vermin crawling in or un-\nder the skin (formication) can lead to scratching and extensive skin excoriations. Cannabis-\ninduced psychotic disorder may develop shortly after high-dose cannabis use and usually\ninvolves persecutory delusions, marked anxiety, emotional lability, and depersonalization.\nThe disorder usually remits within a day but in some cases may persist for a few days.\nSubstance/medication-induced psychotic disorder may at times persist when the offend-\ning agent is removed, such that it may be difficult initially to distinguish it from an indepen-\ndent psychotic disorder. Agents such as amphetamines, phencyclidine, and cocaine have been\nreported to evoke temporary psychotic states that can sometimes persist for weeks or longer\ndespite removal of the agent and treatment with neuroleptic medication. In later life, poly-\npharmacy for medical conditions and exposure to medications for parkinsonism, cardiovas-\ncular disease, and other medical disorders may be associated with a greater likelihood of\npsychosis induced by prescription medications as opposed to substances of abuse.\nDiagnostic Markers \nWith substances for which relevant blood levels are available (e.g., blood alcohol level,\nother quantifiable blood levels such as digoxin), the presence of a level consistent with tox-\nicity may increase diagnostic certainty.\nFunctional Consequences of \nSubstance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder\nSubstance/medication-induced psychotic disorder is typically severely disabling and\nconsequently is observed most frequently in emergency rooms, as individuals are often\nbrought to the acute-care setting when it occurs. However, the disability is typically self-\nlimited and resolves upon removal of the offending agent.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nSubstance intoxication or substance withdrawal.\nIndividuals intoxicated with stimu-\nlants, cannabis, the opioid meperidine, or phencyclidine, or those withdrawing from alco-\nhol or sedatives, may experience altered perceptions that they recognize as drug effects. If\nreality testing for these experiences remains intact (i.e., the individual recognizes that the\nperception is substance induced and neither believes in nor acts on it), the diagnosis is not\nsubstance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. Instead, substance intoxication or\nsubstance withdrawal, with perceptual disturbances, is diagnosed (e.g., cocaine intoxica-\ntion, with perceptual disturbances). “Flashback” hallucinations that can occur long after\nthe use of hallucinogens has stopped are diagnosed as hallucinogen persisting perception\ndisorder. If substance/medication-induced psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during\nthe course of a delirium, as in severe forms of alcohol withdrawal, the psychotic symptoms\nare considered to be an associated feature of the delirium and are not diagnosed sepa-\nrately. Delusions in the context of a major or mild neurocognitive disorder would be di-\nagnosed as major or mild neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral disturbance.\nPsychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\n115\nPrimary psychotic disorder.\nA substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder is\ndistinguished from a primary psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective\ndisorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, other specified schizophrenia\nspectrum and other psychotic disorder, or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other\npsychotic disorder, by the fact that a substance is judged to be etiologically related to the\nsymptoms.\nPsychotic disorder due to another medical condition.\nA substance/medication-induced\npsychotic disorder due to a prescribed treatment for a mental or medical condition must\nhave its onset while the individual is receiving the medication (or during withdrawal, if\nthere is a withdrawal syndrome associated with the medication). Because individuals with\nmedical conditions often take medications for those conditions, the clinician must con-\nsider the possibility that the psychotic symptoms are caused by the physiological conse-\nquences of the medical condition rather than the medication, in which case psychotic\ndisorder due to another medical condition is diagnosed. The history often provides the\nprimary basis for such a judgment. At times, a change in the treatment for the medical con-\ndition (e.g., medication substitution or discontinuation) may be needed to determine em-\npirically for that individual whether the medication is the causative agent. If the clinician\nhas ascertained that the disturbance is attributable to both a medical condition and sub-\nstance/medication use, both diagnoses (i.e., psychotic disorder due to another medical\ncondition and substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder) may be given.", "provenance": {"source_file": "schizophrenia_spectrum_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 6, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.527324"}}

Olfactory hallucinations are suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. Hallucina-\ntions may vary from simple and unformed to highly complex and organized, depending\non etiological and environmental factors. Psychotic disorder due to another medical con-\ndition is generally not diagnosed if the individual maintains reality testing for the hallu-\ncinations and appreciates that they result from the medical condition. Delusions may have\na variety of themes, including somatic, grandiose, religious, and, most commonly, perse-\ncutory. On the whole, however, associations between delusions and particular medical\nconditions appear to be less specific than is the case for hallucinations.\nIn determining whether the psychotic disturbance is attributable to another medical\ncondition, the presence of a medical condition must be identified and considered to be the\netiology of the psychosis through a physiological mechanism. Although there are no\ninfallible guidelines for determining whether the relationship between the psychotic distur-\nbance and the medical condition is etiological, several considerations provide some guidance.\nOne consideration is the presence of a temporal association between the onset, exacerba-\ntion, or remission of the medical condition and that of the psychotic disturbance. A second\nconsideration is the presence of features that are atypical for a psychotic disorder (e.g.,\natypical age at onset or presence of visual or olfactory hallucinations). The disturbance must\nalso be distinguished from a substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder or an-\nother mental disorder (e.g., an adjustment disorder). \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nThe temporal association of the onset or exacerbation of the medical condition offers the\ngreatest diagnostic certainty that the delusions or hallucinations are attributable to a med-\nical condition. Additional factors may include concomitant treatments for the underlying\nmedical condition that confer a risk for psychosis independently, such as steroid treatment\nfor autoimmune disorders.\nPrevalence\nPrevalence rates for psychotic disorder due to another medical condition are difficult to es-\ntimate given the wide variety of underlying medical etiologies. Lifetime prevalence has\nPsychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\n117\nbeen estimated to range from 0.21% to 0.54%. When the prevalence findings are stratified\nby age group, individuals older than 65 years have a significantly greater prevalence of\n0.74% compared with those in younger age groups. Rates of psychosis also vary according\nto the underlying medical condition; conditions most commonly associated with psy-\nchosis include untreated endocrine and metabolic disorders, autoimmune disorders (e.g.,\nsystemic lupus erythematosus, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor autoimmune en-\ncephalitis), or temporal lobe epilepsy. Psychosis due to epilepsy has been further differ-\nentiated into ictal, postictal, and interictal psychosis. The most common of these is postictal\npsychosis, observed in 2%–7.8% of epilepsy patients. Among older individuals, there may\nbe a higher prevalence of the disorder in females, although additional gender-related fea-\ntures are not clear and vary considerably with the gender distributions of the underlying\nmedical conditions.\nDevelopment and Course\nPsychotic disorder due to another medical condition may be a single transient state or it\nmay be recurrent, cycling with exacerbations and remissions of the underlying medical\ncondition. Although treatment of the underlying medical condition often results in a res-\nolution of the psychosis, this is not always the case, and psychotic symptoms may persist\nlong after the medical event (e.g., psychotic disorder due to focal brain injury). In the con-\ntext of chronic conditions such as multiple sclerosis or chronic interictal psychosis of epi-\nlepsy, the psychosis may assume a long-term course.\nThe expression of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition does not differ\nsubstantially in phenomenology depending on age at occurrence. However, older age\ngroups have a higher prevalence of the disorder, which is most likely due to the increasing\nmedical burden associated with advanced age and the cumulative effects of deleterious\nexposures and age-related processes (e.g., atherosclerosis). The nature of the underlying\nmedical conditions is likely to change across the lifespan, with younger age groups more\naffected by epilepsy, head trauma, autoimmune, and neoplastic diseases of early to mid-\nlife, and older age groups more affected by stroke disease, anoxic events, and multiple sys-\ntem comorbidities. Underlying factors with increasing age, such as preexisting cognitive\nimpairment as well as vision and hearing impairments, may incur a greater risk for psy-\nchosis, possibly by serving to lower the threshold for experiencing psychosis. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nCourse modifiers.\nIdentification and treatment of the underlying medical condition has\nthe greatest impact on course, although preexisting central nervous system injury may\nconfer a worse course outcome (e.g., head trauma, cerebrovascular disease).\nDiagnostic Markers\nThe diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition depends on the clin-\nical condition of each individual, and the diagnostic tests will vary according to that con-\ndition. A variety of medical conditions may cause psychotic symptoms. These include\nneurological conditions (e.g., neoplasms, cerebrovascular disease, Huntington's disease,\nmultiple sclerosis, epilepsy, auditory or visual nerve injury or impairment, deafness,\nmigraine, central nervous system infections), endocrine conditions (e.g., hyper- and hypo-\nthyroidism, hyper- and hypoparathyroidism, hyper- and hypoadrenocorticism), metabolic\nconditions (e.g., hypoxia, hypercarbia, hypoglycemia), fluid or electrolyte imbalances,\nhepatic or renal diseases, and autoimmune disorders with central nervous system involve-\nment (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus). The associated physical examination findings,\nlaboratory findings, and patterns of prevalence or onset reflect the etiological medical\ncondition.\n118\nSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\nSuicide Risk \nSuicide risk in the context of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition is not\nclearly delineated, although certain conditions such as epilepsy and multiple sclerosis are\nassociated with increased rates of suicide, which may be further increased in the presence\nof psychosis. \nFunctional Consequences of Psychotic Disorder \nDue to Another Medical Condition\nFunctional disability is typically severe in the context of psychotic disorder due to another\nmedical condition but will vary considerably by the type of condition and likely improve\nwith successful resolution of the condition.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nDelirium.\nHallucinations and delusions commonly occur in the context of a delirium;\nhowever, a separate diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition is\nnot given if the disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium. Delusions\nin the context of a major or mild neurocognitive disorder would be diagnosed as major or\nmild neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral disturbance. \nSubstance/medication-induced psychotic disorder.\nIf there is evidence of recent or\nprolonged substance use (including medications with psychoactive effects), withdrawal\nfrom a substance, or exposure to a toxin (e.g., LSD [lysergic acid diethylamide] intoxica-\ntion, alcohol withdrawal), a substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder should be\nconsidered. Symptoms that occur during or shortly after (i.e., within 4 weeks) of substance\nintoxication or withdrawal or after medication use may be especially indicative of a sub-\nstance-induced psychotic disorder, depending on the character, duration, or amount of\nthe substance used. If the clinician has ascertained that the disturbance is due to both a\nmedical condition and substance use, both diagnoses (i.e., psychotic disorder due to an-\nother medical condition and substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder) can be\ngiven.\nPsychotic disorder.\nPsychotic disorder due to another medical condition must be distin-\nguished from a psychotic disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, delusional disorder, schizoaffective\ndisorder) or a depressive or bipolar disorder, with psychotic features. In psychotic disor-\nders and in depressive or bipolar disorders, with psychotic features, no specific and direct\ncausative physiological mechanisms associated with a medical condition can be demon-\nstrated. Late age at onset and the absence of a personal or family history of schizophrenia\nor delusional disorder suggest the need for a thorough assessment to rule out the diagno-\nsis of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition. Auditory hallucinations that\ninvolve voices speaking complex sentences are more characteristic of schizophrenia than\nof psychotic disorder due to a medical condition. Other types of hallucinations (e.g., vi-\nsual, olfactory) commonly signal a psychotic disorder due to another medical condition or\na substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder.\nComorbidity\nPsychotic disorder due to another medical condition in individuals older than 80 years is\nassociated with concurrent major neurocognitive disorder (dementia).\nCatatonia Associated With Another Mental Disorder (Catatonia Specifier)\n119\nCatatonia\nCatatonia can occur in the context of several disorders, including neurodevelopmental,\npsychotic, bipolar, depressive disorders, and other medical conditions (e.g., cerebral folate\ndeficiency, rare autoimmune and paraneoplastic disorders. The manual does not treat\ncatatonia as an independent class but recognizes a) catatonia associated with another men-\ntal disorder (i.e., a neurodevelopmental, psychotic disorder, a bipolar disorder, a depres-\nsive disorder, or other mental disorder), b) catatonic disorder due to another medical\ncondition, and c) unspecified catatonia.\nCatatonia is defined by the presence of three or more of 12 psychomotor features in the\ndiagnostic criteria for catatonia associated with another mental disorder and catatonic dis-\norder due to another medical condition. The essential feature of catatonia is a marked psy-\nchomotor disturbance that may involve decreased motor activity, decreased engagement\nduring interview or physical examination, or excessive and peculiar motor activity. The\nclinical presentation of catatonia can be puzzling, as the psychomotor disturbance may\nrange from marked unresponsiveness to marked agitation. Motoric immobility may be se-\nvere (stupor) or moderate (catalepsy and waxy flexibility). Similarly, decreased engage-\nment may be severe (mutism) or moderate (negativism). Excessive and peculiar motor\nbehaviors can be complex (e.g., stereotypy) or simple (agitation) and may include echola-\nlia and echopraxia. In extreme cases, the same individual may wax and wane between de-\ncreased and excessive motor activity. The seemingly opposing clinical features and\nvariable manifestations of the diagnosis contribute to a lack of awareness and decreased\nrecognition of catatonia. During severe stages of catatonia, the individual may need care-\nful supervision to avoid self-harm or harming others. There are potential risks from mal-\nnutrition, exhaustion, hyperpyrexia and self-inflicted injury.", "provenance": {"source_file": "schizophrenia_spectrum_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 7, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.527324"}}

The catatonia specifier is appropriate when the\nclinical picture is characterized by marked psychomotor disturbance and involves at least\nthree of the 12 diagnostic features listed in Criterion A. Catatonia is typically diagnosed in\nan inpatient setting and occurs in up to 35% of individuals with schizophrenia, but the ma-\njority of catatonia cases involve individuals with depressive or bipolar disorders. Before\nthe catatonia specifier is used in neurodevelopmental, psychotic, bipolar, depressive, or\nother mental disorders, a wide variety of other medical conditions need to be ruled out;\nthese conditions include, but are not limited to, medical conditions due to infectious, met-\nabolic, or neurological conditions (see “Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Con-\ndition”). Catatonia can also be a side effect of a medication (see the chapter “Medication-\nInduced Movement Disorders and Other Adverse Effects of Medication”). Because of the\nseriousness of the complications, particular attention should be paid to the possibility that\nthe catatonia is attributable to 333.92 (G21.0) neuroleptic malignant syndrome.", "provenance": {"source_file": "schizophrenia_spectrum_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 8, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.528327"}}

Catatonia can be diagnosed by the presence of at least three of the 12 clinical fea-\ntures in Criterion A.

If the individual is currently taking neuroleptic medication, consideration\nshould be given to medication-induced movement disorders (e.g., abnormal positioning\nmay be due to neuroleptic-induced acute dystonia) or neuroleptic malignant syndrome\n(e.g., catatonic-like features may be present, along with associated vital sign and/or labo-\nratory abnormalities). Catatonic symptoms may be present in any of the following five\npsychotic disorders: brief psychotic disorder, schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia,\nschizoaffective disorder, and substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder.
