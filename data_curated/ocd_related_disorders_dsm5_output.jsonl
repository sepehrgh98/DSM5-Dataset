Presence of obsessions, compulsions, or both: \nObsessions are defined by (1) and (2): \n1. Recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced, at some\ntime during the disturbance, as intrusive and unwanted, and that in most individuals\ncause marked anxiety or distress.\n2. The individual attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, urges, or images, or to\nneutralize them with some other thought or action (i.e., by performing a compulsion). \nCompulsions are defined by (1) and (2): \n1. Repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand washing, ordering, checking) or mental acts (e.g.,\npraying, counting, repeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to per-\nform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.\n2. The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing anxiety or dis-\ntress, or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or\nmental acts are not connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neu-\ntralize or prevent, or are clearly excessive.\nNote: Young children may not be able to articulate the aims of these behaviors or\nmental acts.\nB. The obsessions or compulsions are time-consuming (e.g., take more than 1 hour per\nday) or cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or\nother important areas of functioning. \nC. The obsessive-compulsive symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects\nof a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.\nD. The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder\n(e.g., excessive worries, as in generalized anxiety disorder; preoccupation with ap-\npearance, as in body dysmorphic disorder; difficulty discarding or parting with posses-\nsions, as in hoarding disorder; hair pulling, as in trichotillomania [hair-pulling disorder];\nskin picking, as in excoriation [skin-picking] disorder; stereotypies, as in stereotypic\nmovement disorder; ritualized eating behavior, as in eating disorders; preoccupation\nwith substances or gambling, as in substance-related and addictive disorders; preoc-\ncupation with having an illness, as in illness anxiety disorder; sexual urges or fantasies,\nas in paraphilic disorders; impulses, as in disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct dis-\norders; guilty ruminations, as in major depressive disorder; thought insertion or delu-\nsional preoccupations, as in schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders; or\nrepetitive patterns of behavior, as in autism spectrum disorder). \nSpecify if: \nWith good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that obsessive-compulsive dis-\norder beliefs are definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be true.\nWith poor insight: The individual thinks obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs are\nprobably true.\nWith absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is completely convinced that\nobsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs are true.\nSpecify if: \nTic-related: The individual has a current or past history of a tic disorder.\n238\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\nSpecifiers\nMany individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have dysfunctional beliefs.\nThese beliefs can include an inflated sense of responsibility and the tendency to overesti-\nmate threat; perfectionism and intolerance of uncertainty; and over-importance of thoughts\n(e.g., believing that having a forbidden thought is as bad as acting on it) and the need to\ncontrol thoughts. \nIndividuals with OCD vary in the degree of insight they have about the accuracy of the\nbeliefs that underlie their obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Many individuals have good or\nfair insight (e.g., the individual believes that the house definitely will not, probably will not,\nor may or may not burn down if the stove is not checked 30 times). Some have poor insight\n(e.g., the individual believes that the house will probably burn down if the stove is not\nchecked 30 times), and a few (4% or less) have absent insight/delusional beliefs (e.g., the in-\ndividual is convinced that the house will burn down if the stove is not checked 30 times).\nInsight can vary within an individual over the course of the illness. Poorer insight has been\nlinked to worse long-term outcome.\nUp to 30% of individuals with OCD have a lifetime tic disorder. This is most common\nin males with onset of OCD in childhood. These individuals tend to differ from those with-\nout a history of tic disorders in the themes of their OCD symptoms, comorbidity, course,\nand pattern of familial transmission. \nDiagnostic Features\nThe characteristic symptoms of OCD are the presence of obsessions and compulsions (Cri-\nterion A). Obsessions are repetitive and persistent thoughts (e.g., of contamination), images\n(e.g., of violent or horrific scenes), or urges (e.g., to stab someone). Importantly, obsessions\nare not pleasurable or experienced as voluntary: they are intrusive and unwanted and\ncause marked distress or anxiety in most individuals. The individual attempts to ignore or\nsuppress these obsessions (e.g., avoiding triggers or using thought suppression) or to neu-\ntralize them with another thought or action (e.g., performing a compulsion). Compulsions\n(or rituals) are repetitive behaviors (e.g., washing, checking) or mental acts (e.g., counting,\nrepeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an\nobsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly. Most individuals with OCD\nhave both obsessions and compulsions. Compulsions are typically performed in response\nto an obsession (e.g., thoughts of contamination leading to washing rituals or that some-\nthing is incorrect leading to repeating rituals until it feels “just right”). The aim is to reduce\nthe distress triggered by obsessions or to prevent a feared event (e.g., becoming ill). How-\never, these compulsions either are not connected in a realistic way to the feared event (e.g.,\narranging items symmetrically to prevent harm to a loved one) or are clearly excessive\n(e.g., showering for hours each day). Compulsions are not done for pleasure, although some\nindividuals experience relief from anxiety or distress. \nCriterion B emphasizes that obsessions and compulsions must be time-consuming (e.g.,\nmore than 1 hour per day) or cause clinically significant distress or impairment to warrant\na diagnosis of OCD. This criterion helps to distinguish the disorder from the occasional in-\ntrusive thoughts or repetitive behaviors that are common in the general population (e.g.,\ndouble-checking that a door is locked). The frequency and severity of obsessions and com-\npulsions vary across individuals with OCD (e.g., some have mild to moderate symptoms,\nspending 1–3 hours per day obsessing or doing compulsions, whereas others have nearly\nconstant intrusive thoughts or compulsions that can be incapacitating).\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nThe specific content of obsessions and compulsions varies between individuals. However,\ncertain themes, or dimensions, are common, including those of cleaning (contamination\nobsessions and cleaning compulsions); symmetry (symmetry obsessions and repeating,\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder\n239\nordering, and counting compulsions); forbidden or taboo thoughts (e.g., aggressive, sexual,\nor religious obsessions and related compulsions); and harm (e.g., fears of harm to oneself\nor others and checking compulsions). Some individuals also have difficulties discarding\nand accumulate (hoard) objects as a consequence of typical obsessions and compulsions,\nsuch as fears of harming others. These themes occur across different cultures, are rela-\ntively consistent over time in adults with the disorder, and may be associated with differ-\nent neural substrates. Importantly, individuals often have symptoms in more than one\ndimension. \nIndividuals with OCD experience a range of affective responses when confronted with\nsituations that trigger obsessions and compulsions. For example, many individuals expe-\nrience marked anxiety that can include recurrent panic attacks. Others report strong feel-\nings of disgust. While performing compulsions, some individuals report a distressing\nsense of “incompleteness” or uneasiness until things look, feel, or sound “just right.” \nIt is common for individuals with the disorder to avoid people, places, and things that\ntrigger obsessions and compulsions. For example, individuals with contamination con-\ncerns might avoid public situations (e.g., restaurants, public restrooms) to reduce ex-\nposure to feared contaminants; individuals with intrusive thoughts about causing harm\nmight avoid social interactions. \nPrevalence\nThe 12-month prevalence of OCD in the United States is 1.2%, with a similar prevalence in-\nternationally (1.1%–1.8%). Females are affected at a slightly higher rate than males in\nadulthood, although males are more commonly affected in childhood. \nDevelopment and Course\nIn the United States, the mean age at onset of OCD is 19.5 years, and 25% of cases start by\nage 14 years. Onset after age 35 years is unusual but does occur. Males have an earlier age\nat onset than females: nearly 25% of males have onset before age 10 years. The onset of\nsymptoms is typically gradual; however, acute onset has also been reported.\nIf OCD is untreated, the course is usually chronic, often with waxing and waning symp-\ntoms. Some individuals have an episodic course, and a minority have a deteriorating\ncourse. Without treatment, remission rates in adults are low (e.g., 20% for those reevalu-\nated 40 years later). Onset in childhood or adolescence can lead to a lifetime of OCD. How-\never, 40% of individuals with onset of OCD in childhood or adolescence may experience\nremission by early adulthood. The course of OCD is often complicated by the co-occurrence\nof other disorders (see section “Comorbidity” for this disorder).\nCompulsions are more easily diagnosed in children than obsessions are because com-\npulsions are observable. However, most children have both obsessions and compulsions\n(as do most adults). The pattern of symptoms in adults can be stable over time, but it is\nmore variable in children. Some differences in the content of obsessions and compulsions\nhave been reported when children and adolescent samples have been compared with\nadult samples. These differences likely reflect content appropriate to different develop-\nmental stages (e.g., higher rates of sexual and religious obsessions in adolescents than in\nchildren; higher rates of harm obsessions [e.g., fears of catastrophic events, such as death\nor illness to self or loved ones] in children and adolescents than in adults). \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nTemperamental.\nGreater internalizing symptoms, higher negative emotionality, and\nbehavioral inhibition in childhood are possible temperamental risk factors. \nEnvironmental.\nPhysical and sexual abuse in childhood and other stressful or traumatic\nevents have been associated with an increased risk for developing OCD. Some children\n240\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\nmay develop the sudden onset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, which has been asso-\nciated with different environmental factors, including various infectious agents and a\npost-infectious autoimmune syndrome.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThe rate of OCD among first-degree relatives of adults with\nOCD is approximately two times that among first-degree relatives of those without the\ndisorder; however, among first-degree relatives of individuals with onset of OCD in child-\nhood or adolescence, the rate is increased 10-fold. Familial transmission is due in part to\ngenetic factors (e.g., a concordance rate of 0.57 for monozygotic vs. 0.22 for dizygotic twins).\nDysfunction in the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and striatum have been\nmost strongly implicated.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues \nOCD occurs across the world. There is substantial similarity across cultures in the gender\ndistribution, age at onset, and comorbidity of OCD. Moreover, around the globe, there is a\nsimilar symptom structure involving cleaning, symmetry, hoarding, taboo thoughts, or\nfear of harm. However, regional variation in symptom expression exists, and cultural\nfactors may shape the content of obsessions and compulsions.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nMales have an earlier age at onset of OCD than females and are more likely to have co-\nmorbid tic disorders. Gender differences in the pattern of symptom dimensions have been\nreported, with, for example, females more likely to have symptoms in the cleaning dimen-\nsion and males more likely to have symptoms in the forbidden thoughts and symmetry di-\nmensions. Onset or exacerbation of OCD, as well as symptoms that can interfere with the\nmother-infant relationship (e.g., aggressive obsessions leading to avoidance of the infant),\nhave been reported in the peripartum period. \nSuicide Risk\nSuicidal thoughts occur at some point in as many as about half of individuals with OCD.\nSuicide attempts are also reported in up to one-quarter of individuals with OCD; the pres-\nence of comorbid major depressive disorder increases the risk. \nFunctional Consequences of \nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder\nOCD is associated with reduced quality of life as well as high levels of social and occupa-\ntional impairment. Impairment occurs across many different domains of life and is asso-\nciated with symptom severity. Impairment can be caused by the time spent obsessing and\ndoing compulsions. Avoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions or compulsions\ncan also severely restrict functioning. In addition, specific symptoms can create specific\nobstacles. For example, obsessions about harm can make relationships with family and\nfriends feel hazardous; the result can be avoidance of these relationships. Obsessions\nabout symmetry can derail the timely completion of school or work projects because the\nproject never feels “just right,” potentially resulting in school failure or job loss. Health\nconsequences can also occur. For example, individuals with contamination concerns may\navoid doctors’ offices and hospitals (e.g., because of fears of exposure to germs) or develop\ndermatological problems (e.g., skin lesions due to excessive washing). Sometimes the\nsymptoms of the disorder interfere with its own treatment (e.g., when medications are con-\nsidered contaminated). When the disorder starts in childhood or adolescence, individuals\nmay experience developmental difficulties. For example, adolescents may avoid socializ-\ning with peers; young adults may struggle when they leave home to live independently.\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder\n241\nThe result can be few significant relationships outside the family and a lack of autonomy\nand financial independence from their family of origin. In addition, some individuals with\nOCD try to impose rules and prohibitions on family members because of their disorder\n(e.g., no one in the family can have visitors to the house for fear of contamination), and this\ncan lead to family dysfunction. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nAnxiety disorders.\nRecurrent thoughts, avoidant behaviors, and repetitive requests for\nreassurance can also occur in anxiety disorders. However, the recurrent thoughts that are\npresent in generalized anxiety disorder (i.e., worries) are usually about real-life concerns,\nwhereas the obsessions of OCD usually do not involve real-life concerns and can include\ncontent that is odd, irrational, or of a seemingly magical nature; moreover, compulsions\nare often present and usually linked to the obsessions. Like individuals with OCD, indi-\nviduals with specific phobia can have a fear reaction to specific objects or situations; how-\never, in specific phobia the feared object is usually much more circumscribed, and rituals\nare not present. In social anxiety disorder (social phobia), the feared objects or situations\nare limited to social interactions, and avoidance or reassurance seeking is focused on re-\nducing this social fear.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nOCD can be distinguished from the rumination of major\ndepressive disorder, in which thoughts are usually mood-congruent and not necessarily\nexperienced as intrusive or distressing; moreover, ruminations are not linked to compul-\nsions, as is typical in OCD. \nOther obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nIn body dysmorphic disorder, the\nobsessions and compulsions are limited to concerns about physical appearance; and in\ntrichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), the compulsive behavior is limited to hair pulling\nin the absence of obsessions. Hoarding disorder symptoms focus exclusively on the per-\nsistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, marked distress associated with\ndiscarding items, and excessive accumulation of objects. However, if an individual has ob-\nsessions that are typical of OCD (e.g., concerns about incompleteness or harm), and these\nobsessions lead to compulsive hoarding behaviors (e.g., acquiring all objects in a set to at-\ntain a sense of completeness or not discarding old newspapers because they may contain\ninformation that could prevent harm), a diagnosis of OCD should be given instead. \nEating disorders.\nOCD can be distinguished from anorexia nervosa in that in OCD the\nobsessions and compulsions are not limited to concerns about weight and food.\nTics (in tic disorder) and stereotyped movements.\nA tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent,\nnonrhythmic motor movement or vocalization (e.g., eye blinking, throat clearing). A ste-\nreotyped movement is a repetitive, seemingly driven, nonfunctional motor behavior (e.g.,\nhead banging, body rocking, self-biting). Tics and stereotyped movements are typically\nless complex than compulsions and are not aimed at neutralizing obsessions. However,\ndistinguishing between complex tics and compulsions can be difficult. Whereas compul-\nsions are usually preceded by obsessions, tics are often preceded by premonitory sensory\nurges. Some individuals have symptoms of both OCD and a tic disorder, in which case\nboth diagnoses may be warranted. \nPsychotic disorders.\nSome individuals with OCD have poor insight or even delusional\nOCD beliefs. However, they have obsessions and compulsions (distinguishing their\ncondition from delusional disorder) and do not have other features of schizophrenia or\nschizoaffective disorder (e.g., hallucinations or formal thought disorder). \nOther compulsive-like behaviors.\nCertain behaviors are sometimes described as “com-\npulsive,” including sexual behavior (in the case of paraphilias), gambling (i.e., gambling\n242\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\ndisorder), and substance use (e.g., alcohol use disorder). However, these behaviors differ\nfrom the compulsions of OCD in that the person usually derives pleasure from the activity\nand may wish to resist it only because of its deleterious consequences.\nObsessive-compulsive personality disorder.\nAlthough obsessive-compulsive person-\nality disorder and OCD have similar names, the clinical manifestations of these disorders\nare quite different. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is not characterized by in-\ntrusive thoughts, images, or urges or by repetitive behaviors that are performed in re-\nsponse to these intrusions; instead, it involves an enduring and pervasive maladaptive\npattern of excessive perfectionism and rigid control. If an individual manifests symptoms\nof both OCD and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, both diagnoses can be given.\nComorbidity \nIndividuals with OCD often have other psychopathology. Many adults with the disorder\nhave a lifetime diagnosis of an anxiety disorder (76%; e.g., panic disorder, social anxiety\ndisorder, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia) or a depressive or bipolar disorder\n(63% for any depressive or bipolar disorder, with the most common being major depres-\nsive disorder [41%]). Onset of OCD is usually later than for most comorbid anxiety disor-\nders (with the exception of separation anxiety disorder) and PTSD but often precedes that\nof depressive disorders. Comorbid obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is also\ncommon in individuals with OCD (e.g., ranging from 23% to 32%). \nUp to 30% of individuals with OCD also have a lifetime tic disorder. A comorbid tic\ndisorder is most common in males with onset of OCD in childhood. These individuals\ntend to differ from those without a history of tic disorders in the themes of their OCD\nsymptoms, comorbidity, course, and pattern of familial transmission. A triad of OCD, tic\ndisorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder can also be seen in children.\nDisorders that occur more frequently in individuals with OCD than in those without\nthe disorder include several obsessive-compulsive and related disorders such as body\ndysmorphic disorder, trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), and excoriation (skin-pick-\ning) disorder. Finally, an association between OCD and some disorders characterized by\nimpulsivity, such as oppositional defiant disorder, has been reported. \nOCD is also much more common in individuals with certain other disorders than\nwould be expected based on its prevalence in the general population; when one of those\nother disorders is diagnosed, the individual should be assessed for OCD as well. For ex-\nample, in individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the prevalence of\nOCD is approximately 12%. Rates of OCD are also elevated in bipolar disorder; eating dis-\norders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa; and Tourette’s disorder.", "provenance": {"source_file": "ocd_related_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 1, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.491384"}}

Preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance that\nare not observable or appear slight to others.  \nB. At some point during the course of the disorder, the individual has performed repetitive\nbehaviors (e.g., mirror checking, excessive grooming, skin picking, reassurance seek-\ning) or mental acts (e.g., comparing his or her appearance with that of others) in re-\nsponse to the appearance concerns.\nC. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-\npational, or other important areas of functioning. \nD. The appearance preoccupation is not better explained by concerns with body fat or\nweight in an individual whose symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder.\nBody Dysmorphic Disorder\n243\nSpecify if:\nWith muscle dysmorphia: The individual is preoccupied with the idea that his or her\nbody build is too small or insufficiently muscular. This specifier is used even if the indi-\nvidual is preoccupied with other body areas, which is often the case. \nSpecify if: \nIndicate degree of insight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs (e.g., “I look ugly” or\n“I look deformed”).\nWith good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that the body dysmorphic disor-\nder beliefs are definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be true.\nWith poor insight: The individual thinks that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are\nprobably true.\nWith absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is completely convinced that\nthe body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true.\nDiagnostic Features \nIndividuals with body dysmorphic disorder (formerly known as dysmorphophobia) are pre-\noccupied with one or more perceived defects or flaws in their physical appearance, which\nthey believe look ugly, unattractive, abnormal, or deformed (Criterion A). The perceived\nflaws are not observable or appear only slight to other individuals. Concerns range from\nlooking “unattractive” or “not right” to looking “hideous” or “like a monster.” Preoccu-\npations can focus on one or many body areas, most commonly the skin (e.g., perceived\nacne, scars, lines, wrinkles, paleness), hair (e.g., “thinning” hair or “excessive” body or fa-\ncial hair), or nose (e.g., size or shape). However, any body area can be the focus of concern\n(e.g., eyes, teeth, weight, stomach, breasts, legs, face size or shape, lips, chin, eyebrows,\ngenitals). Some individuals are concerned about perceived asymmetry of body areas. The\npreoccupations are intrusive, unwanted, time-consuming (occurring, on average, 3–8\nhours per day), and usually difficult to resist or control. \nExcessive repetitive behaviors or mental acts (e.g., comparing) are performed in re-\nsponse to the preoccupation (Criterion B). The individual feels driven to perform these be-\nhaviors, which are not pleasurable and may increase anxiety and dysphoria. They are\ntypically time-consuming and difficult to resist or control. Common behaviors are com-\nparing one’s appearance with that of other individuals; repeatedly checking perceived\ndefects in mirrors or other reflecting surfaces or examining them directly; excessively\ngrooming (e.g., combing, styling, shaving, plucking, or pulling hair); camouflaging (e.g.,\nrepeatedly applying makeup or covering disliked areas with such things as a hat, clothing,\nmakeup, or hair); seeking reassurance about how the perceived flaws look; touching dis-\nliked areas to check them; excessively exercising or weight lifting; and seeking cosmetic\nprocedures. Some individuals excessively tan (e.g., to darken “pale” skin or diminish per-\nceived acne), repeatedly change their clothes (e.g., to camouflage perceived defects), or\ncompulsively shop (e.g., for beauty products). Compulsive skin picking intended to\nimprove perceived skin defects is common and can cause skin damage, infections, or\nruptured blood vessels. The preoccupation must cause clinically significant distress or im-\npairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C);\nusually both are present. Body dysmorphic disorder must be differentiated from an eating\ndisorder.\nMuscle dysmorphia, a form of body dysmorphic disorder occurring almost exclusively\nin males, consists of preoccupation with the idea that one’s body is too small or insuffi-\nciently lean or muscular. Individuals with this form of the disorder actually have a nor-\nmal-looking body or are even very muscular. They may also be preoccupied with other\nbody areas, such as skin or hair. A majority (but not all) diet, exercise, and/or lift weights\nexcessively, sometimes causing bodily damage. Some use potentially dangerous anabolic-\n244\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\nandrogenic steroids and other substances to try to make their body bigger and more mus-\ncular. Body dysmorphic disorder by proxy is a form of body dysmorphic disorder in\nwhich individuals are preoccupied with defects they perceive in another person’s appear-\nance.\nInsight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs can range from good to absent/\ndelusional (i.e., delusional beliefs consisting of complete conviction that the individual’s\nview of their appearance is accurate and undistorted). On average, insight is poor; one-\nthird or more of individuals currently have delusional body dysmorphic disorder beliefs.\nIndividuals with delusional body dysmorphic disorder tend to have greater morbidity in\nsome areas (e.g., suicidality), but this appears accounted for by their tendency to have\nmore severe body dysmorphic disorder symptoms. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis \nMany individuals with body dysmorphic disorder have ideas or delusions of reference,\nbelieving that other people take special notice of them or mock them because of how they\nlook. Body dysmorphic disorder is associated with high levels of anxiety, social anxiety,\nsocial avoidance, depressed mood, neuroticism, and perfectionism as well as low extro-\nversion and low self-esteem. Many individuals are ashamed of their appearance and their\nexcessive focus on how they look, and are reluctant to reveal their concerns to others. A\nmajority of individuals receive cosmetic treatment to try to improve their perceived de-\nfects. Dermatological treatment and surgery are most common, but any type (e.g., dental,\nelectrolysis) may be received. Occasionally, individuals may perform surgery on them-\nselves. Body dysmorphic disorder appears to respond poorly to such treatments and\nsometimes becomes worse. Some individuals take legal action or are violent toward the\nclinician because they are dissatisfied with the cosmetic outcome.\nBody dysmorphic disorder has been associated with executive dysfunction and visual\nprocessing abnormalities, with a bias for analyzing and encoding details rather than ho-\nlistic or configural aspects of visual stimuli. Individuals with this disorder tend to have a\nbias for negative and threatening interpretations of facial expressions and ambiguous sce-\nnarios. \nPrevalence \nThe point prevalence among U.S. adults is 2.4% (2.5% in females and 2.2% in males). Out-\nside the United States (i.e., Germany), current prevalence is approximately 1.7%–1.8%,\nwith a gender distribution similar to that in the United States. The current prevalence is\n9%–15% among dermatology patients, 7%–8% among U.S. cosmetic surgery patients, 3%–\n16% among international cosmetic surgery patients (most studies), 8% among adult orth-\nodontia patients, and 10% among patients presenting for oral or maxillofacial surgery.\nDevelopment and Course \nThe mean age at disorder onset is 16–17 years, the median age at onset is 15 years, and the\nmost common age at onset is 12–13 years. Two-thirds of individuals have disorder onset\nbefore age 18. Subclinical body dysmorphic disorder symptoms begin, on average, at age\n12 or 13 years. Subclinical concerns usually evolve gradually to the full disorder, although\nsome individuals experience abrupt onset of body dysmorphic disorder. The disorder\nappears to usually be chronic, although improvement is likely when evidence-based\ntreatment is received. The disorder’s clinical features appear largely similar in children/\nadolescents and adults. Body dysmorphic disorder occurs in the elderly, but little is known\nabout the disorder in this age group. Individuals with disorder onset before age 18 years\nare more likely to attempt suicide, have more comorbidity, and have gradual (rather than\nacute) disorder onset than those with adult-onset body dysmorphic disorder.\nBody Dysmorphic Disorder\n245\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nEnvironmental.\nBody dysmorphic disorder has been associated with high rates of child-\nhood neglect and abuse. \nGenetic and physiological.\nThe prevalence of body dysmorphic disorder is elevated in\nfirst-degree relatives of individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues \nBody dysmorphic disorder has been reported internationally. It appears that the disorder\nmay have more similarities than differences across races and cultures but that cultural\nvalues and preferences may influence symptom content to some degree. Taijin kyofusho,\nincluded in the traditional Japanese diagnostic system, has a subtype similar to body dys-\nmorphic disorder: shubo-kyofu (“the phobia of a deformed body”). \nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues \nFemales and males appear to have more similarities than differences in terms of most clin-\nical features— for example, disliked body areas, types of repetitive behaviors, symptom\nseverity, suicidality, comorbidity, illness course, and receipt of cosmetic procedures for\nbody dysmorphic disorder. However, males are more likely to have genital preoccupa-\ntions, and females are more likely to have a comorbid eating disorder. Muscle dysmorphia\noccurs almost exclusively in males. \nSuicide Risk\nRates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are high in both adults and children/ado-\nlescents with body dysmorphic disorder. Furthermore, risk for suicide appears high in ad-\nolescents. A substantial proportion of individuals attribute suicidal ideation or suicide\nattempts primarily to their appearance concerns. Individuals with body dysmorphic dis-\norder have many risk factors for completed suicide, such as high rates of suicidal ideation\nand suicide attempts, demographic characteristics associated with suicide, and high rates\nof comorbid major depressive disorder. \nFunctional Consequences of \nBody Dysmorphic Disorder\nNearly all individuals with body dysmorphic disorder experience impaired psychosocial\nfunctioning because of their appearance concerns. Impairment can range from moderate\n(e.g., avoidance of some social situations) to extreme and incapacitating (e.g., being com-\npletely housebound). On average, psychosocial functioning and quality of life are mark-\nedly poor. More severe body dysmorphic disorder symptoms are associated with poorer\nfunctioning and quality of life. Most individuals experience impairment in their job, aca-\ndemic, or role functioning (e.g., as a parent or caregiver), which is often severe (e.g., per-\nforming poorly, missing school or work, not working). About 20% of youths with body\ndysmorphic disorder report dropping out of school primarily because of their body dys-\nmorphic disorder symptoms. Impairment in social functioning (e.g., social activities, rela-\ntionships, intimacy), including avoidance, is common. Individuals may be housebound\nbecause of their body dysmorphic disorder symptoms, sometimes for years. A high pro-\nportion of adults and adolescents have been psychiatrically hospitalized.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nNormal appearance concerns and clearly noticeable physical defects.\nBody dysmor-\nphic disorder differs from normal appearance concerns in being characterized by exces-\n246\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\nsive appearance-related preoccupations and repetitive behaviors that are time-consuming,\nare usually difficult to resist or control, and cause clinically significant distress or impair-\nment in functioning. Physical defects that are clearly noticeable (i.e., not slight) are not\ndiagnosed as body dysmorphic disorder. However, skin picking as a symptom of body\ndysmorphic disorder can cause noticeable skin lesions and scarring; in such cases, body dys-\nmorphic disorder should be diagnosed.\nEating disorders.\nIn an individual with an eating disorder, concerns about being fat are\nconsidered a symptom of the eating disorder rather than body dysmorphic disorder.\nHowever, weight concerns may occur in body dysmorphic disorder. Eating disorders and\nbody dysmorphic disorder can be comorbid, in which case both should be diagnosed. \nOther obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nThe preoccupations and repetitive\nbehaviors of body dysmorphic disorder differ from obsessions and compulsions in OCD\nin that the former focus only on appearance. These disorders have other differences, such\nas poorer insight in body dysmorphic disorder. When skin picking is intended to improve\nthe appearance of perceived skin defects, body dysmorphic disorder, rather than excoria-\ntion (skin-picking) disorder, is diagnosed. When hair removal (plucking, pulling, or other\ntypes of removal) is intended to improve perceived defects in the appearance of facial\nor body hair, body dysmorphic disorder is diagnosed rather than trichotillomania (hair-\npulling disorder).\nIllness anxiety disorder.\nIndividuals with body dysmorphic disorder are not preoccu-\npied with having or acquiring a serious illness and do not have particularly elevated levels\nof somatization. \nMajor depressive disorder.\nThe prominent preoccupation with appearance and exces-\nsive repetitive behaviors in body dysmorphic disorder differentiate it from major de-\npressive disorder. However, major depressive disorder and depressive symptoms are\ncommon in individuals with body dysmorphic disorder, often appearing to be secondary\nto the distress and impairment that body dysmorphic disorder causes. Body dysmorphic\ndisorder should be diagnosed in depressed individuals if diagnostic criteria for body dys-\nmorphic disorder are met. \nAnxiety disorders.\nSocial anxiety and avoidance are common in body dysmorphic dis-\norder. However, unlike social anxiety disorder (social phobia), agoraphobia, and avoidant\npersonality disorder, body dysmorphic disorder includes prominent appearance-related\npreoccupation, which may be delusional, and repetitive behaviors, and the social anxiety\nand avoidance are due to concerns about perceived appearance defects and the belief or\nfear that other people will consider these individuals ugly, ridicule them, or reject them be-\ncause of their physical features. Unlike generalized anxiety disorder, anxiety and worry in\nbody dysmorphic disorder focus on perceived appearance flaws. \nPsychotic disorders.\nMany individuals with body dysmorphic disorder have delu-\nsional appearance beliefs (i.e., complete conviction that their view of their perceived de-\nfects is accurate), which is diagnosed as body dysmorphic disorder, with absent insight/\ndelusional beliefs, not as delusional disorder. Appearance-related ideas or delusions of\nreference are common in body dysmorphic disorder; however, unlike schizophrenia or\nschizoaffective disorder, body dysmorphic disorder involves prominent appearance pre-\noccupations and related repetitive behaviors, and disorganized behavior and other psy-\nchotic symptoms are absent (except for appearance beliefs, which may be delusional). \nOther disorders and symptoms.\nBody dysmorphic disorder should not be diagnosed if\nthe preoccupation is limited to discomfort with or a desire to be rid of one’s primary and/\nor secondary sex characteristics in an individual with gender dysphoria or if the preoccu-\npation focuses on the belief that one emits a foul or offensive body odor as in olfactory\nreference syndrome (which is not a DSM-5 disorder). Body identity integrity disorder\nHoarding Disorder\n247\n(apotemnophilia) (which is not a DSM-5 disorder) involves a desire to have a limb ampu-\ntated to correct an experience of mismatch between a person’s sense of body identity and\nhis or her actual anatomy. However, the concern does not focus on the limb’s appearance,\nas it would in body dysmorphic disorder. Koro, a culturally related disorder that usually\noccurs in epidemics in Southeastern Asia, consists of a fear that the penis (labia, nipples, or\nbreasts in females) is shrinking or retracting and will disappear into the abdomen, often\naccompanied by a belief that death will result. Koro differs from body dysmorphic disor-\nder in several ways, including a focus on death rather than preoccupation with perceived\nugliness. Dysmorphic concern (which is not a DSM-5 disorder) is a much broader construct\nthan, and is not equivalent to, body dysmorphic disorder. It involves symptoms reflecting\nan overconcern with slight or imagined flaws in appearance.\nComorbidity \nMajor depressive disorder is the most common comorbid disorder, with onset usually af-\nter that of body dysmorphic disorder. Comorbid social anxiety disorder (social phobia),\nOCD, and substance-related disorders are also common.", "provenance": {"source_file": "ocd_related_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 2, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.491384"}}

Persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value.\nB. This difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and to distress associated\nwith discarding them.\nC. The difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that\ncongest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended\nuse. If living areas are uncluttered, it is only because of the interventions of third parties\n(e.g., family members, cleaners, authorities).\nD. The hoarding causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning (including maintaining a safe environ-\nment for self and others).\nE. The hoarding is not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., brain injury, cere-\nbrovascular disease, Prader-Willi syndrome).\nF. The hoarding is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g.,\nobsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder, decreased energy in major depressive\ndisorder, delusions in schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder, cognitive deficits in\nmajor neurocognitive disorder, restricted interests in autism spectrum disorder). \nSpecify if:\nWith excessive acquisition: If difficulty discarding possessions is accompanied by ex-\ncessive acquisition of items that are not needed or for which there is no available space.\nSpecify if:\nWith good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that hoarding-related beliefs and\nbehaviors (pertaining to difficulty discarding items, clutter, or excessive acquisition) are\nproblematic.\nWith poor insight: The individual is mostly convinced that hoarding-related beliefs\nand behaviors (pertaining to difficulty discarding items, clutter, or excessive acquisi-\ntion) are not problematic despite evidence to the contrary.\nWith absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is completely convinced that\nhoarding-related beliefs and behaviors (pertaining to difficulty discarding items, clutter,\nor excessive acquisition) are not problematic despite evidence to the contrary.\n248\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\nSpecifiers\nWith excessive acquisition.\nApproximately 80%–90% of individuals with hoarding\ndisorder display excessive acquisition. The most frequent form of acquisition is excessive\nbuying, followed by acquisition of free items (e.g., leaflets, items discarded by others).\nStealing is less common. Some individuals may deny excessive acquisition when first as-\nsessed, yet it may appear later during the course of treatment. Individuals with hoarding\ndisorder typically experience distress if they are unable to or are prevented from acquiring\nitems.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of hoarding disorder is persistent difficulties discarding or parting\nwith possessions, regardless of their actual value (Criterion A). The term persistent indi-\ncates a long-standing difficulty rather than more transient life circumstances that may lead\nto excessive clutter, such as inheriting property. The difficulty in discarding possessions\nnoted in Criterion A refers to any form of discarding, including throwing away, selling,\ngiving away, or recycling. The main reasons given for these difficulties are the perceived\nutility or aesthetic value of the items or strong sentimental attachment to the possessions.\nSome individuals feel responsible for the fate of their possessions and often go to great\nlengths to avoid being wasteful. Fears of losing important information are also common.\nThe most commonly saved items are newspapers, magazines, old clothing, bags, books,\nmail, and paperwork, but virtually any item can be saved. The nature of items is not lim-\nited to possessions that most other people would define as useless or of limited value.\nMany individuals collect and save large numbers of valuable things as well, which are of-\nten found in piles mixed with other less valuable items. \nIndividuals with hoarding disorder purposefully save possessions and experience dis-\ntress when facing the prospect of discarding them (Criterion B). This criterion emphasizes\nthat the saving of possessions is intentional, which discriminates hoarding disorder from\nother forms of psychopathology that are characterized by the passive accumulation of\nitems or the absence of distress when possessions are removed. \nIndividuals accumulate large numbers of items that fill up and clutter active living ar-\neas to the extent that their intended use is no longer possible (Criterion C). For example,\nthe individual may not be able to cook in the kitchen, sleep in his or her bed, or sit in a\nchair. If the space can be used, it is only with great difficulty. Clutter is defined as a large\ngroup of usually unrelated or marginally related objects piled together in a disorganized\nfashion in spaces designed for other purposes (e.g., tabletops, floor, hallway). Criterion C\nemphasizes the “active” living areas of the home, rather than more peripheral areas, such\nas garages, attics, or basements, that are sometimes cluttered in homes of individuals with-\nout hoarding disorder. However, individuals with hoarding disorder often have posses-\nsions that spill beyond the active living areas and can occupy and impair the use of other\nspaces, such as vehicles, yards, the workplace, and friends’ and relatives’ houses. In some\ncases, living areas may be uncluttered because of the intervention of third parties (e.g.,\nfamily members, cleaners, local authorities). Individuals who have been forced to clear\ntheir homes still have a symptom picture that meets criteria for hoarding disorder because\nthe lack of clutter is due to a third-party intervention. Hoarding disorder contrasts with\nnormative collecting behavior, which is organized and systematic, even if in some cases\nthe actual amount of possessions may be similar to the amount accumulated by an indi-\nvidual with hoarding disorder. Normative collecting does not produce the clutter, dis-\ntress, or impairment typical of hoarding disorder. \nSymptoms (i.e., difficulties discarding and/or clutter) must cause clinically significant\ndistress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning, in-\ncluding maintaining a safe environment for self and others (Criterion D). In some cases,\nHoarding Disorder\n249\nparticularly when there is poor insight, the individual may not report distress, and the im-\npairment may be apparent only to those around the individual. However, any attempts to\ndiscard or clear the possessions by third parties result in high levels of distress. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nOther common features of hoarding disorder include indecisiveness, perfectionism,\navoidance, procrastination, difficulty planning and organizing tasks, and distractibility.\nSome individuals with hoarding disorder live in unsanitary conditions that may be a log-\nical consequence of severely cluttered spaces and/or that are related to planning and or-\nganizing difficulties. Animal hoarding can be defined as the accumulation of a large number\nof animals and a failure to provide minimal standards of nutrition, sanitation, and veter-\ninary care and to act on the deteriorating condition of the animals (including disease, star-\nvation, or death) and the environment (e.g., severe overcrowding, extremely unsanitary\nconditions). Animal hoarding may be a special manifestation of hoarding disorder. Most\nindividuals who hoard animals also hoard inanimate objects. The most prominent differ-\nences between animal and object hoarding are the extent of unsanitary conditions and the\npoorer insight in animal hoarding. \nPrevalence\nNationally representative prevalence studies of hoarding disorder are not available. Com-\nmunity surveys estimate the point prevalence of clinically significant hoarding in the\nUnited States and Europe to be approximately 2%–6%. Hoarding disorder affects both\nmales and females, but some epidemiological studies have reported a significantly greater\nprevalence among males. This contrasts with clinical samples, which are predominantly\nfemale. Hoarding symptoms appear to be almost three times more prevalent in older\nadults (ages 55–94 years) compared with younger adults (ages 34–44 years). \nDevelopment and Course\nHoarding appears to begin early in life and spans well into the late stages. Hoarding symp-\ntoms may first emerge around ages 11–15 years, start interfering with the individual’s ev-\neryday functioning by the mid-20s, and cause clinically significant impairment by the\nmid-30s. Participants in clinical research studies are usually in their 50s. Thus, the severity\nof hoarding increases with each decade of life. Once symptoms begin, the course of hoard-\ning is often chronic, with few individuals reporting a waxing and waning course.\nPathological hoarding in children appears to be easily distinguished from develop-\nmentally adaptive saving and collecting behaviors. Because children and adolescents\ntypically do not control their living environment and discarding behaviors, the possible\nintervention of third parties (e.g., parents keeping the spaces usable and thus reducing in-\nterference) should be considered when making the diagnosis. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nTemperamental.\nIndecisiveness is a prominent feature of individuals with hoarding dis-\norder and their first-degree relatives.\nEnvironmental.\nIndividuals with hoarding disorder often retrospectively report stressful\nand traumatic life events preceding the onset of the disorder or causing an exacerbation. \nGenetic and physiological.\nHoarding behavior is familial, with about 50% of individu-\nals who hoard reporting having a relative who also hoards. Twin studies indicate that ap-\nproximately 50% of the variability in hoarding behavior is attributable to additive genetic\nfactors. \n250\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nWhile most of the research has been done in Western, industrialized countries and urban\ncommunities, the available data from non-Western and developing countries suggest that\nhoarding is a universal phenomenon with consistent clinical features. \nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nThe key features of hoarding disorder (i.e., difficulties discarding, excessive amount of\nclutter) are generally comparable in males and females, but females tend to display more\nexcessive acquisition, particularly excessive buying, than do males. \nFunctional Consequences of Hoarding Disorder\nClutter impairs basic activities, such as moving through the house, cooking, cleaning, per-\nsonal hygiene, and even sleeping. Appliances may be broken, and utilities such as water\nand electricity may be disconnected, as access for repair work may be difficult. Quality of\nlife is often considerably impaired. In severe cases, hoarding can put individuals at risk for\nfire, falling (especially elderly individuals), poor sanitation, and other health risks. Hoard-\ning disorder is associated with occupational impairment, poor physical health, and high\nsocial service utilization. Family relationships are frequently under great strain. Conflict\nwith neighbors and local authorities is common, and a substantial proportion of individ-\nuals with severe hoarding disorder have been involved in legal eviction proceedings, and\nsome have a history of eviction. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther medical conditions.\nHoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms are\njudged to be a direct consequence of another medical condition (Criterion E), such as trau-\nmatic brain injury, surgical resection for treatment of a tumor or seizure control, cerebro-\nvascular disease, infections of the central nervous system (e.g., herpes simplex encephalitis),\nor neurogenetic conditions such as Prader-Willi syndrome. Damage to the anterior ven-\ntromedial prefrontal and cingulate cortices has been particularly associated with the ex-\ncessive accumulation of objects. In these individuals, the hoarding behavior is not present\nprior to the onset of the brain damage and appears shortly after the brain damage occurs.\nSome of these individuals appear to have little interest in the accumulated items and are\nable to discard them easily or do not care if others discard them, whereas others appear to\nbe very reluctant to discard anything. \nNeurodevelopmental disorders.\nHoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumula-\ntion of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of a neurodevelopmental disorder, such\nas autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).\nSchizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.\nHoarding disorder is not di-\nagnosed if the accumulation of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of delusions or\nnegative symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.\nMajor depressive episode.\nHoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of\nobjects is judged to be a direct consequence of psychomotor retardation, fatigue, or loss of\nenergy during a major depressive episode. \nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nHoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms\nare judged to be a direct consequence of typical obsessions or compulsions, such as fears\nof contamination, harm, or feelings of incompleteness in obsessive-compulsive disorder\n(OCD). Feelings of incompleteness (e.g., losing one’s identity, or having to document and\npreserve all life experiences) are the most frequent OCD symptoms associated with this\nform of hoarding. The accumulation of objects can also be the result of persistently avoid-\nTrichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)\n251\ning onerous rituals (e.g., not discarding objects in order to avoid endless washing or check-\ning rituals).\nIn OCD, the behavior is generally unwanted and highly distressing, and the individual ex-\nperiences no pleasure or reward from it. Excessive acquisition is usually not present; if exces-\nsive acquisition is present, items are acquired because of a specific obsession (e.g., the need to\nbuy items that have been accidentally touched in order to avoid contaminating other people),\nnot because of a genuine desire to possess the items. Individuals who hoard in the context of\nOCD are also more likely to accumulate bizarre items, such as trash, feces, urine, nails, hair,\nused diapers, or rotten food. Accumulation of such items is very unusual in hoarding disorder.\nWhen severe hoarding appears concurrently with other typical symptoms of OCD but\nis judged to be independent from these symptoms, both hoarding disorder and OCD may\nbe diagnosed. \nNeurocognitive disorders.\nHoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of\nobjects is judged to be a direct consequence of a degenerative disorder, such as neurocog-\nnitive disorder associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration or Alzheimer’s disease.\nTypically, onset of the accumulating behavior is gradual and follows onset of the neuro-\ncognitive disorder. The accumulating behavior may be accompanied by self-neglect and\nsevere domestic squalor, alongside other neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as disinhibi-\ntion, gambling, rituals/stereotypies, tics, and self-injurious behaviors. \nComorbidity\nApproximately 75% of individuals with hoarding disorder have a comorbid mood or anx-\niety disorder. The most common comorbid conditions are major depressive disorder (up\nto 50% of cases), social anxiety disorder (social phobia), and generalized anxiety disorder.\nApproximately 20% of individuals with hoarding disorder also have symptoms that meet\ndiagnostic criteria for OCD. These comorbidities may often be the main reason for consul-\ntation, because individuals are unlikely to spontaneously report hoarding symptoms, and\nthese symptoms are often not asked about in routine clinical interviews.", "provenance": {"source_file": "ocd_related_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 3, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.492385"}}

The hair pulling is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder\n(e.g., attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw in appearance in body dysmorphic\ndisorder).\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) is the recurrent pulling out\nof one’s own hair (Criterion A). Hair pulling may occur from any region of the body in\nwhich hair grows; the most common sites are the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelids, while less\ncommon sites are axillary, facial, pubic, and peri-rectal regions. Hair-pulling sites may\nvary over time. Hair pulling may occur in brief episodes scattered throughout the day or\nduring less frequent but more sustained periods that can continue for hours, and such hair\n252\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\npulling may endure for months or years. Criterion A requires that hair pulling lead to hair\nloss, although individuals with this disorder may pull hair in a widely distributed pattern\n(i.e., pulling single hairs from all over a site) such that hair loss may not be clearly visible.\nAlternatively, individuals may attempt to conceal or camouflage hair loss (e.g., by using\nmakeup, scarves, or wigs). Individuals with trichotillomania have made repeated at-\ntempts to decrease or stop hair pulling (Criterion B). Criterion C indicates that hair pulling\ncauses clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other impor-\ntant areas of functioning. The term distress includes negative affects that may be experi-\nenced by individuals with hair pulling, such as feeling a loss of control, embarrassment,\nand shame. Significant impairment may occur in several different areas of functioning\n(e.g., social, occupational, academic, and leisure), in part because of avoidance of work,\nschool, or other public situations. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nHair pulling may be accompanied by a range of behaviors or rituals involving hair. Thus,\nindividuals may search for a particular kind of hair to pull (e.g., hairs with a specific tex-\nture or color), may try to pull out hair in a specific way (e.g., so that the root comes out in-\ntact), or may visually examine or tactilely or orally manipulate the hair after it has been\npulled (e.g., rolling the hair between the fingers, pulling the strand between the teeth, bit-\ning the hair into pieces, or swallowing the hair). \nHair pulling may also be preceded or accompanied by various emotional states; it may\nbe triggered by feelings of anxiety or boredom, may be preceded by an increasing sense of\ntension (either immediately before pulling out the hair or when attempting to resist the\nurge to pull), or may lead to gratification, pleasure, or a sense of relief when the hair is\npulled out. Hair-pulling behavior may involve varying degrees of conscious awareness,\nwith some individuals displaying more focused attention on the hair pulling (with pre-\nceding tension and subsequent relief), and other individuals displaying more automatic\nbehavior (in which the hair pulling seems to occur without full awareness). Many individ-\nuals report a mix of both behavioral styles. Some individuals experience an “itch-like” or\ntingling sensation in the scalp that is alleviated by the act of pulling hair. Pain does not\nusually accompany hair pulling.\nPatterns of hair loss are highly variable. Areas of complete alopecia, as well as areas of\nthinned hair density, are common. When the scalp is involved, there may be a predilection\nfor pulling out hair in the crown or parietal regions. There may be a pattern of nearly com-\nplete baldness except for a narrow perimeter around the outer margins of the scalp, par-\nticularly at the nape of the neck (“tonsure trichotillomania”). Eyebrows and eyelashes may\nbe completely absent. \nHair pulling does not usually occur in the presence of other individuals, except imme-\ndiate family members. Some individuals have urges to pull hair from other individuals\nand may sometimes try to find opportunities to do so surreptitiously. Some individuals\nmay pull hairs from pets, dolls, and other fibrous materials (e.g., sweaters or carpets).\nSome individuals may deny their hair pulling to others. The majority of individuals with\ntrichotillomania also have one or more other body-focused repetitive behaviors, including\nskin picking, nail biting, and lip chewing.\nPrevalence\nIn the general population, the 12-month prevalence estimate for trichotillomania in adults\nand adolescents is 1%–2%. Females are more frequently affected than males, at a ratio of\napproximately 10:1. This estimate likely reflects the true gender ratio of the condition, al-\nthough it may also reflect differential treatment seeking based on gender or cultural at-\ntitudes regarding appearance (e.g., acceptance of normative hair loss among males).\nAmong children with trichotillomania, males and females are more equally represented. \nTrichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)\n253\nDevelopment and Course\nHair pulling may be seen in infants, and this behavior typically resolves during early devel-\nopment. Onset of hair pulling in trichotillomania most commonly coincides with, or follows\nthe onset of, puberty. Sites of hair pulling may vary over time. The usual course of trichotillo-\nmania is chronic, with some waxing and waning if the disorder is untreated. Symptoms may\npossibly worsen in females accompanying hormonal changes (e.g., menstruation, perimeno-\npause). For some individuals, the disorder may come and go for weeks, months, or years at a\ntime. A minority of individuals remit without subsequent relapse within a few years of onset. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nGenetic and physiological.\nThere is evidence for a genetic vulnerability to trichotillo-\nmania. The disorder is more common in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder\n(OCD) and their first-degree relatives than in the general population. \nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues \nTrichotillomania appears to manifest similarly across cultures, although there is a paucity\nof data from non-Western regions.\nDiagnostic Markers\nMost individuals with trichotillomania admit to hair pulling; thus, dermatopathological\ndiagnosis is rarely required. Skin biopsy and dermoscopy (or trichoscopy) of trichotillo-\nmania are able to differentiate the disorder from other causes of alopecia. In trichotil-\nlomania, dermoscopy shows a range of characteristic features, including decreased hair\ndensity, short vellus hair, and broken hairs with different shaft lengths. \nFunctional Consequences of \nTrichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)\nTrichotillomania is associated with distress as well as with social and occupational impair-\nment. There may be irreversible damage to hair growth and hair quality. Infrequent med-\nical consequences of trichotillomania include digit purpura, musculoskeletal injury (e.g.,\ncarpal tunnel syndrome; back, shoulder and neck pain), blepharitis, and dental damage\n(e.g., worn or broken teeth due to hair biting). Swallowing of hair (trichophagia) may lead\nto trichobezoars, with subsequent anemia, abdominal pain, hematemesis, nausea and\nvomiting, bowel obstruction, and even perforation. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nNormative hair removal/manipulation.\nTrichotillomania should not be diagnosed when\nhair removal is performed solely for cosmetic reasons (i.e., to improve one’s physical ap-\npearance). Many individuals twist and play with their hair, but this behavior does not usu-\nally qualify for a diagnosis of trichotillomania. Some individuals may bite rather than pull\nhair; again, this does not qualify for a diagnosis of trichotillomania.\nOther obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nIndividuals with OCD and sym-\nmetry concerns may pull out hairs as part of their symmetry rituals, and individuals with\nbody dysmorphic disorder may remove body hair that they perceive as ugly, asymmetri-\ncal, or abnormal; in such cases a diagnosis of trichotillomania is not given. The description\nof body-focused repetitive behavior disorder in other specified obsessive-compulsive and\nrelated disorder excludes individuals who meet diagnostic criteria for trichotillomania.\n254\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\nNeurodevelopmental disorders.\nIn neurodevelopmental disorders, hair pulling may\nmeet the definition of stereotypies (e.g., in stereotypic movement disorder). Tics (in tic dis-\norders) rarely lead to hair pulling.\nPsychotic disorder.\nIndividuals with a psychotic disorder may remove hair in response\nto a delusion or hallucination. Trichotillomania is not diagnosed in such cases.\nAnother medical condition.\nTrichotillomania is not diagnosed if the hair pulling or hair\nloss is attributable to another medical condition (e.g., inflammation of the skin or other der-\nmatological conditions). Other causes of scarring alopecia (e.g., alopecia areata, androgenic\nalopecia, telogen effluvium) or nonscarring alopecia (e.g., chronic discoid lupus erythema-\ntosus, lichen planopilaris, central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, pseudopelade, folliculitis\ndecalvans, dissecting folliculitis, acne keloidalis nuchae) should be considered in individu-\nals with hair loss who deny hair pulling. Skin biopsy or dermoscopy can be used to differ-\nentiate individuals with trichotillomania from those with dermatological disorders.\nSubstance-related disorders.\nHair-pulling symptoms may be exacerbated by certain\nsubstances—for example, stimulants—but it is less likely that substances are the primary\ncause of persistent hair pulling. \nComorbidity\nTrichotillomania is often accompanied by other mental disorders, most commonly major\ndepressive disorder and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder. Repetitive body-focused\nsymptoms other than hair pulling or skin picking (e.g. nail biting) occur in the majority of\nindividuals with trichotillomania and may deserve an additional diagnosis of other spec-\nified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (i.e., body-focused repetitive behavior\ndisorder).", "provenance": {"source_file": "ocd_related_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 4, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.492385"}}

The most commonly picked sites are the face, arms, and hands, but\nmany individuals pick from multiple body sites. Individuals may pick at healthy skin, at\nminor skin irregularities, at lesions such as pimples or calluses, or at scabs from previous\npicking.

Skin picking may also be pre-\nceded or accompanied by various emotional states. Skin picking may be triggered by feelings\nof anxiety or boredom, may be preceded by an increasing sense of tension (either immedi-\nately before picking the skin or when attempting to resist the urge to pick), and may lead to\ngratification, pleasure, or a sense of relief when the skin or scab has been picked. Some indi-\nviduals report picking in response to a minor skin irregularity or to relieve an uncomfortable\nbodily sensation. Pain is not routinely reported to accompany skin picking. Some individuals\nengage in skin picking that is more focused (i.e., with preceding tension and subsequent re-\nlief), whereas others engage in more automatic picking (i.e., when skin picking occurs with-\nout preceding tension and without full awareness), and many have a mix of both behavioral\nstyles. Skin picking does not usually occur in the presence of other individuals, except im-\nmediate family members. Some individuals report picking the skin of others.\nPrevalence\nIn the general population, the lifetime prevalence for excoriation disorder in adults is 1.4%\nor somewhat higher. Three-quarters or more of individuals with the disorder are female.\nThis likely reflects the true gender ratio of the condition, although it may also reflect dif-\nferential treatment seeking based on gender or cultural attitudes regarding appearance.\nDevelopment and Course\nAlthough individuals with excoriation disorder may present at various ages, the skin pick-\ning most often has onset during adolescence, commonly coinciding with or following the\nonset of puberty. The disorder frequently begins with a dermatological condition, such\nas acne. Sites of skin picking may vary over time. The usual course is chronic, with some\nwaxing and waning if untreated. For some individuals, the disorder may come and go for\nweeks, months, or years at a time.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nGenetic and physiological.\nExcoriation disorder is more common in individuals with\nobsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and their first-degree family members than in the\ngeneral population.\nDiagnostic Markers\nMost individuals with excoriation disorder admit to skin picking; therefore, dermato-\npathological diagnosis is rarely required. However, the disorder may have characteristic\nfeatures on histopathology. \n256\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\nFunctional Consequences of \nExcoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder \nExcoriation disorder is associated with distress as well as with social and occupational im-\npairment. The majority of individuals with this condition spend at least 1 hour per day\npicking, thinking about picking, and resisting urges to pick. Many individuals report\navoiding social or entertainment events as well as going out in public. A majority of indi-\nviduals with the disorder also report experiencing work interference from skin picking on\nat least a daily or weekly basis. A significant proportion of students with excoriation disor-\nder report having missed school, having experienced difficulties managing responsibilities\nat school, or having had difficulties studying because of skin picking. Medical complica-\ntions of skin picking include tissue damage, scarring, and infection and can be life-threaten-\ning. Rarely, synovitis of the wrists due to chronic picking has been reported. Skin picking\noften results in significant tissue damage and scarring. It frequently requires antibiotic treat-\nment for infection, and on occasion it may require surgery.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nPsychotic disorder.\nSkin picking may occur in response to a delusion (i.e., parasitosis)\nor tactile hallucination (i.e., formication) in a psychotic disorder. In such cases, excoriation\ndisorder should not be diagnosed. \nOther obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nExcessive washing compulsions\nin response to contamination obsessions in individuals with OCD may lead to skin lesions,\nand skin picking may occur in individuals with body dysmorphic disorder who pick their\nskin solely because of appearance concerns; in such cases, excoriation disorder should not\nbe diagnosed. The description of body-focused repetitive behavior disorder in other spec-\nified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder excludes individuals whose symptoms\nmeet diagnostic criteria for excoriation disorder.\nNeurodevelopmental disorders.\nWhile stereotypic movement disorder may be charac-\nterized by repetitive self-injurious behavior, onset is in the early developmental period.\nFor example, individuals with the neurogenetic condition Prader-Willi syndrome may\nhave early onset of skin picking, and their symptoms may meet criteria for stereotypic\nmovement disorder. While tics in individuals with Tourette’s disorder may lead to self-\ninjury, the behavior is not tic-like in excoriation disorder. \nSomatic symptom and related disorders.\nExcoriation disorder is not diagnosed if the\nskin lesion is primarily attributable to deceptive behaviors in factitious disorder.\nOther disorders.\nExcoriation disorder is not diagnosed if the skin picking is primarily\nattributable to the intention to harm oneself that is characteristic of nonsuicidal self-injury.\nOther medical conditions.\nExcoriation disorder is not diagnosed if the skin picking is\nprimarily attributable to another medical condition. For example, scabies is a dermatolog-\nical condition invariably associated with severe itching and scratching. However, excori-\nation disorder may be precipitated or exacerbated by an underlying dermatological\ncondition. For example, acne may lead to some scratching and picking, which may also be\nassociated with comorbid excoriation disorder. The differentiation between these two\nclinical situations (acne with some scratching and picking vs. acne with comorbid excori-\nation disorder) requires an assessment of the extent to which the individual’s skin picking\nhas become independent of the underlying dermatological condition. \nSubstance/medication-induced disorders.\nSkin-picking symptoms may also be induced\nby certain substances (e.g., cocaine), in which case excoriation disorder should not be di-\nagnosed. If such skin picking is clinically significant, then a diagnosis of substance/med-\nication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder should be considered. \nSubstance/Medication-Induced Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder\n257\nComorbidity\nExcoriation disorder is often accompanied by other mental disorders. Such disorders in-\nclude OCD and trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), as well as major depressive dis-\norder. Repetitive body-focused symptoms other than skin picking and hair pulling (e.g.,\nnail biting) occur in many individuals with excoriation disorder and may deserve an ad-\nditional diagnosis of other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (i.e.,\nbody-focused repetitive behavior disorder).", "provenance": {"source_file": "ocd_related_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 5, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.492385"}}

If a mild substance use disorder is\ncomorbid with the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, the 4th\nposition character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder”\nbefore the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (e.g., “mild co-\ncaine use disorder with cocaine-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder”). If\na moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced ob-\nsessive-compulsive and related disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician\nshould record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,”\ndepending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid\n258\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\nsubstance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th\nposition character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the substance-induced ob-\nsessive-compulsive and related disorder.\nSpecify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders” for di-\nagnoses associated with substance class):\nWith onset during intoxication: If the criteria are met for intoxication with the sub-\nstance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.\nWith onset during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance\nand the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.\nWith onset after medication use: Symptoms may appear either at initiation of medi-\ncation or after a modification or change in use.\nRecording Procedures\nICD-9-CM.\nThe name of the substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and\nrelated disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine) that is presumed to be\ncausing the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected\nfrom the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances\nthat do not fit into any of the classes, the code for “other substance” should be used; and in\ncases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of sub-\nstance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used.\nThe name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during in-\ntoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset after medication use). Unlike the record-\ning procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance-induced disorder and\nsubstance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is\ngiven for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of repetitive behaviors oc-\ncurring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is\n292.89 cocaine-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, with onset during in-\ntoxication. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use disorder is also given.\nWhen more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of\nthe obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, each should be listed separately.\nICD-10-CM.\nThe name of the substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and re-\nlated disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine) that is presumed to be causing\nthe obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the ta-\nble included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a\ncomorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes,\nthe code for “other substance” with no comorbid substance use should be used; and in cases in\nwhich a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is un-\nknown, the category “unknown substance” with no comorbid substance use should be used.\nICD-10-CM\nICD-9-CM\nWith use \ndisorder, \nmild\nWith use \ndisorder, \nmoderate \nor severe\nWithout \nuse \ndisorder\nAmphetamine (or other \nstimulant)\n292.89\nF15.188\nF15.288\nF15.988\nCocaine\n292.89\nF14.188\nF14.288\nF14.988\nOther (or unknown) substance\n292.89\nF19.188\nF19.288\nF19.988\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder\n259\nWhen recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is\nlisted first, followed by the word “with,” followed by the name of the substance-induced ob-\nsessive-compulsive and related disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset dur-\ning intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset after medication use). For example, in\nthe case of repetitive behaviors occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine\nuse disorder, the diagnosis is F14.288 severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced obses-\nsive-compulsive and related disorder, with onset during intoxication. A separate diagnosis of\nthe comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced obsessive-\ncompulsive and related disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after\na one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g.,\nF15.988 amphetamine-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, with onset during\nintoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the devel-\nopment of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, each should be listed separately.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential features of substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related\ndisorder are prominent symptoms of an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (Criterion\nA) that are judged to be attributable to the effects of a substance (e.g., drug of abuse, medica-\ntion). The obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms must have developed during\nor soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication or toxin,\nand the substance/medication must be capable of producing the symptoms (Criterion B). Sub-\nstance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to a prescribed\ntreatment for a mental disorder or general medical condition must have its onset while the in-\ndividual is receiving the medication. Once the treatment is discontinued, the obsessive-com-\npulsive and related disorder symptoms will usually improve or remit within days to several\nweeks to 1 month (depending on the half-life of the substance/medication). The diagnosis of\nsubstance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder should not be\ngiven if onset of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms precedes the sub-\nstance intoxication or medication use, or if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of\ntime, usually longer than 1 month, from the time of severe intoxication or withdrawal. If the\nobsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms persist for a substantial period of time,\nother causes for the symptoms should be considered. The substance/medication-induced ob-\nsessive-compulsive and related disorder diagnosis should be made in addition to a diagnosis\nof substance intoxication only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical\npicture and are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nObsessions, compulsions, hair pulling, skin picking, or other body-focused repetitive be-\nhaviors can occur in association with intoxication with the following classes of substances:\nstimulants (including cocaine) and other (or unknown) substances. Heavy metals and tox-\nins may also cause obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms. Laboratory as-\nsessments (e.g., urine toxicology) may be useful to measure substance intoxication as part\nof an assessment for obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nPrevalence\nIn the general population, the very limited data that are available indicate that substance-\ninduced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder is very rare. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nSubstance intoxication.\nObsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms may oc-\ncur in substance intoxication. The diagnosis of the substance-specific intoxication will usu-\n260\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\nally suffice to categorize the symptom presentation. A diagnosis of an obsessive-compulsive\nand related disorder should be made in addition to substance intoxication when the symp-\ntoms are judged to be in excess of those usually associated with intoxication and are suf-\nficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.\nObsessive-compulsive and related disorder (i.e., not induced by a substance).\nSub-\nstance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder is judged to be\netiologically related to the substance/medication. Substance/medication-induced obses-\nsive-compulsive and related disorder is distinguished from a primary obsessive-compul-\nsive and related disorder by considering the onset, course, and other factors with respect\nto substances/medications. For drugs of abuse, there must be evidence from the history,\nphysical examination, or laboratory findings for use or intoxication. Substance/medica-\ntion-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder arises only in association with in-\ntoxication, whereas a primary obsessive-compulsive and related disorder may precede the\nonset of substance/medication use. The presence of features that are atypical of a primary\nobsessive-compulsive and related disorder, such as atypical age at onset of symptoms,\nmay suggest a substance-induced etiology. A primary obsessive-compulsive and related\ndisorder diagnosis is warranted if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time\n(about 1 month or longer) after the end of the substance intoxication or the individual has\na history of an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder.\nObsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition.\nIf the\nobsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms are attributable to another medical\ncondition (i.e., rather than to the medication taken for the other medical condition), obses-\nsive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition should be diag-\nnosed. The history often provides the basis for judgment. At times, a change in the\ntreatment for the other medical condition (e.g., medication substitution or discontinua-\ntion) may be needed to determine whether or not the medication is the causative agent (in\nwhich case the symptoms may be better explained by substance/medication-induced ob-\nsessive-compulsive and related disorder). If the disturbance is attributable to both another\nmedical condition and substance use, both diagnoses (i.e., obsessive-compulsive and related\ndisorder due to another medical condition and substance/medication-induced obsessive-\ncompulsive and related disorder) may be given. When there is insufficient evidence to de-\ntermine whether the symptoms are attributable to either a substance/medication or an-\nother medical condition or are primary (i.e., attributable to neither a substance/medication\nnor another medical condition), a diagnosis of other specified or unspecified obsessive-\ncompulsive and related disorder would be indicated.\nDelirium.\nIf obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms occur exclusively\nduring the course of delirium, they are considered to be an associated feature of the delir-\nium and are not diagnosed separately.", "provenance": {"source_file": "ocd_related_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 6, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.492385"}}

Symptoms can include prominent obsessions, compulsions, preoccu-\npations with appearance, hoarding, hair pulling, skin picking, or other body-focused\nrepetitive behaviors (Criterion A). The judgment that the symptoms are best explained by\nthe associated medical condition must be based on evidence from the history, physical ex-\namination, or laboratory findings (Criterion B). Additionally, it must be judged that the\nsymptoms are not better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion C). The diagno-\nsis is not made if the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms occur only during the\ncourse of a delirium (Criterion D). The obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms must\ncause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other impor-\ntant areas of functioning (Criterion E).\nIn determining whether the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms are attribut-\nable to another medical condition, a relevant medical condition must be present. Further-\nmore, it must be established that obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms can be\netiologically related to the medical condition through a pathophysiological mechanism\nand that this best explains the symptoms in the individual. Although there are no infallible\nguidelines for determining whether the relationship between the obsessive-compulsive\nand related symptoms and the medical condition is etiological, considerations that may\nprovide some guidance in making this diagnosis include the presence of a clear temporal\nassociation between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of the medical condition and the\nobsessive-compulsive and related symptoms; the presence of features that are atypical of\na primary obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (e.g., atypical age at onset or course);\nand evidence in the literature that a known physiological mechanism (e.g., striatal dam-\nage) causes obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms. In addition, the disturbance\ncannot be better explained by a primary obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, a sub-\nstance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, or another men-\ntal disorder.\nThere is some controversy about whether obsessive-compulsive and related disorders\ncan be attributed to Group A streptococcal infection. Sydenham’s chorea is the neurolog-\n262\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\nical manifestation of rheumatic fever, which is in turn due to Group A streptococcal in-\nfection. Sydenham’s chorea is characterized by a combination of motor and nonmotor\nfeatures. Nonmotor features include obsessions, compulsions, attention deficit, and emo-\ntional lability. Although individuals with Sydenham’s chorea may present with non-\nneuropsychiatric features of acute rheumatic fever, such as carditis and arthritis, they may\npresent with obsessive-compulsive disorder–like symptoms; such individuals should\nbe diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical\ncondition. \nPediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infec-\ntions (PANDAS) has been identified as another post-infectious autoimmune disorder\ncharacterized by the sudden onset of obsessions, compulsions, and/or tics accompanied\nby a variety of acute neuropsychiatric symptoms in the absence of chorea, carditis, or ar-\nthritis, after Group A streptococcal infection. Although there is a body of evidence that\nsupports the existence of PANDAS, it remains a controversial diagnosis. Given this ongo-\ning controversy, the description of PANDAS has been modified to eliminate etiological\nfactors and to designate an expanded clinical entity: pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiat-\nric syndrome (PANS) or idiopathic childhood acute neuropsychiatric symptoms (CANS),\nwhich deserves further study.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nA number of other medical disorders are known to include obsessive-compulsive and re-\nlated symptoms as a manifestation. Examples include disorders leading to striatal dam-\nage, such as cerebral infarction.\nDevelopment and Course\nThe development and course of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another\nmedical condition generally follows the course of the underlying illness. \nDiagnostic Markers\nLaboratory assessments and/or medical examinations are necessary to confirm the diag-\nnosis of another medical condition.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nDelirium.\nA separate diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to an-\nother medical condition is not given if the disturbance occurs exclusively during the\ncourse of a delirium. However, a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder\ndue to another medical condition may be given in addition to a diagnosis of major neuro-\ncognitive disorder (dementia) if the etiology of the obsessive-compulsive symptoms is\njudged to be a physiological consequence of the pathological process causing the dementia\nand if obsessive-compulsive symptoms are a prominent part of the clinical presentation. \nMixed presentation of symptoms (e.g., mood and obsessive-compulsive and related\ndisorder symptoms).\nIf the presentation includes a mix of different types of symptoms,\nthe specific mental disorder due to another medical condition depends on which symp-\ntoms predominate in the clinical picture.\nSubstance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nIf there\nis evidence of recent or prolonged substance use (including medications with psychoac-\ntive effects), withdrawal from a substance, or exposure to a toxin, a substance/medication-\ninduced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder should be considered. When a sub-\nstance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder is being diag-\nnosed in relation to drugs of abuse, it may be useful to obtain a urine or blood drug screen\nOther Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder\n263\nor other appropriate laboratory evaluation. Symptoms that occur during or shortly after\n(i.e., within 4 weeks of) substance intoxication or withdrawal or after medication use may\nbe especially indicative of a substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and re-\nlated disorder, depending on the type, duration, or amount of the substance used.\nObsessive-compulsive and related disorders (primary).\nObsessive-compulsive and re-\nlated disorder due to another medical condition should be distinguished from a primary\nobsessive-compulsive and related disorder. In primary mental disorders, no specific and\ndirect causative physiological mechanisms associated with a medical condition can be\ndemonstrated. Late age at onset or atypical symptoms suggest the need for a thorough as-\nsessment to rule out the diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to an-\nother medical condition. \nIllness anxiety disorder.\nIllness anxiety disorder is characterized by a preoccupation with\nhaving or acquiring a serious illness. In the case of illness anxiety disorder, individuals\nmay or may not have diagnosed medical conditions.\nAssociated feature of another mental disorder.\nObsessive-compulsive and related symp-\ntoms may be an associated feature of another mental disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, an-\norexia nervosa). \nOther specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder or unspecified obsessive-\ncompulsive and related disorder.\nThese diagnoses are given if it is unclear whether the\nobsessive-compulsive and related symptoms are primary, substance-induced, or due to\nanother medical condition.", "provenance": {"source_file": "ocd_related_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 7, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.492385"}}
