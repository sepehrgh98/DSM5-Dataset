This discrepancy is the core component of the diagnosis. There must\nalso be evidence of distress about this incongruence. Experienced gender may include al-\nternative gender identities beyond binary stereotypes. Consequently, the distress is not\nlimited to a desire to simply be of the other gender, but may include a desire to be of an al-\nternative gender, provided that it differs from the individual’s assigned gender. \nGender dysphoria manifests itself differently in different age groups. Prepubertal natal\ngirls with gender dysphoria may express the wish to be a boy, assert they are a boy, or as-\nsert they will grow up to be a man. They prefer boys’ clothing and hairstyles, are often\nperceived by strangers as boys, and may ask to be called by a boy’s name. Usually, they dis-\nplay intense negative reactions to parental attempts to have them wear dresses or other\nfeminine attire. Some may refuse to attend school or social events where such clothes are\nrequired. These girls may demonstrate marked cross-gender identification in role-playing,\ndreams, and fantasies. Contact sports, rough-and-tumble play, traditional boyhood games,\nand boys as playmates are most often preferred. They show little interest in stereotypically\nfeminine toys (e.g., dolls) or activities (e.g., feminine dress-up or role-play). Occasionally,\nthey refuse to urinate in a sitting position. Some natal girls may express a desire to have a\npenis or claim to have a penis or that they will grow one when older. They may also state that\nthey do not want to develop breasts or menstruate.\nPrepubertal natal boys with gender dysphoria may express the wish to be a girl or as-\nsert they are a girl or that they will grow up to be a woman. They have a preference for\ndressing in girls’ or women’s clothes or may improvise clothing from available materials\n(e.g., using towels, aprons, and scarves for long hair or skirts). These children may role-\nplay female figures (e.g., playing “mother”) and often are intensely interested in female\nfantasy figures. Traditional feminine activities, stereotypical games, and pastimes (e.g.,\n“playing house”; drawing feminine pictures; watching television or videos of favorite fe-\nmale characters) are most often preferred. Stereotypical female-type dolls (e.g., Barbie) are\noften favorite toys, and girls are their preferred playmates. They avoid rough-and-tumble\nplay and competitive sports and have little interest in stereotypically masculine toys (e.g.,\ncars, trucks). Some may pretend not to have a penis and insist on sitting to urinate. More\n454\nGender Dysphoria\nrarely, they may state that they find their penis or testes disgusting, that they wish them re-\nmoved, or that they have, or wish to have, a vagina.\nIn young adolescents with gender dysphoria, clinical features may resemble those of\nchildren or adults with the condition, depending on developmental level. As secondary\nsex characteristics of young adolescents are not yet fully developed, these individuals may\nnot state dislike of them, but they are concerned about imminent physical changes. \nIn adults with gender dysphoria, the discrepancy between experienced gender and\nphysical sex characteristics is often, but not always, accompanied by a desire to be rid of\nprimary and/or secondary sex characteristics and/or a strong desire to acquire some pri-\nmary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender. To varying degrees, adults\nwith gender dysphoria may adopt the behavior, clothing, and mannerisms of the experi-\nenced gender. They feel uncomfortable being regarded by others, or functioning in soci-\nety, as members of their assigned gender. Some adults may have a strong desire to be of a\ndifferent gender and treated as such, and they may have an inner certainty to feel and re-\nspond as the experienced gender without seeking medical treatment to alter body char-\nacteristics. They may find other ways to resolve the incongruence between experienced/\nexpressed and assigned gender by partially living in the desired role or by adopting a gen-\nder role neither conventionally male nor conventionally female.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nWhen visible signs of puberty develop, natal boys may shave their legs at the first signs of\nhair growth. They sometimes bind their genitals to make erections less visible. Girls may\nbind their breasts, walk with a stoop, or use loose sweaters to make breasts less visible. In-\ncreasingly, adolescents request, or may obtain without medical prescription and supervi-\nsion, hormonal suppressors (“blockers”) of gonadal steroids (e.g., gonadotropin-releasing\nhormone [GnRH] analog, spironolactone). Clinically referred adolescents often want hor-\nmone treatment and many also wish for gender reassignment surgery. Adolescents living in\nan accepting environment may openly express the desire to be and be treated as the experi-\nenced gender and dress partly or completely as the experienced gender, have a hairstyle typ-\nical of the experienced gender, preferentially seek friendships with peers of the other gender,\nand/or adopt a new first name consistent with the experienced gender. Older adolescents,\nwhen sexually active, usually do not show or allow partners to touch their sexual organs. For\nadults with an aversion toward their genitals, sexual activity is constrained by the preference\nthat their genitals not be seen or touched by their partners. Some adults may seek hormone\ntreatment (sometimes without medical prescription and supervision) and gender reassign-\nment surgery. Others are satisfied with either hormone treatment or surgery alone.\nAdolescents and adults with gender dysphoria before gender reassignment are at in-\ncreased risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicides. After gender reassign-\nment, adjustment may vary, and suicide risk may persist.\nPrevalence \nFor natal adult males, prevalence ranges from 0.005% to 0.014%, and for natal females,\nfrom 0.002% to 0.003%. Since not all adults seeking hormone treatment and surgical reas-\nsignment attend specialty clinics, these rates are likely modest underestimates. Sex differ-\nences in rate of referrals to specialty clinics vary by age group. In children, sex ratios of\nnatal boys to girls range from 2:1 to 4.5:1. In adolescents, the sex ratio is close to parity; in\nadults, the sex ratio favors natal males, with ratios ranging from 1:1 to 6.1:1. In two coun-\ntries, the sex ratio appears to favor natal females (Japan: 2.2:1; Poland: 3.4:1). \nDevelopment and Course \nBecause expression of gender dysphoria varies with age, there are separate criteria sets for\nchildren versus adolescents and adults. Criteria for children are defined in a more con-\nGender Dysphoria\n455\ncrete, behavioral manner than those for adolescents and adults. Many of the core criteria\ndraw on well-documented behavioral gender differences between typically developing\nboys and girls. Young children are less likely than older children, adolescents, and adults\nto express extreme and persistent anatomic dysphoria. In adolescents and adults, incon-\ngruence between experienced gender and somatic sex is a central feature of the diagnosis.\nFactors related to distress and impairment also vary with age. A very young child may\nshow signs of distress (e.g., intense crying) only when parents tell the child that he or she\nis “really” not a member of the other gender but only “desires” to be. Distress may not be\nmanifest in social environments supportive of the child’s desire to live in the role of the\nother gender and may emerge only if the desire is interfered with. In adolescents and\nadults, distress may manifest because of strong incongruence between experienced gender\nand somatic sex. Such distress may, however, be mitigated by supportive environments and\nknowledge that biomedical treatments exist to reduce incongruence. Impairment (e.g.,\nschool refusal, development of depression, anxiety, and substance abuse) may be a conse-\nquence of gender dysphoria.\nGender dysphoria without a disorder of sex development.\nFor clinic-referred children,\nonset of cross-gender behaviors is usually between ages 2 and 4 years. This corresponds to\nthe developmental time period in which most typically developing children begin ex-\npressing gendered behaviors and interests. For some preschool-age children, both perva-\nsive cross-gender behaviors and the expressed desire to be the other gender may be\npresent, or, more rarely, labeling oneself as a member of the other gender may occur. In\nsome cases, the expressed desire to be the other gender appears later, usually at entry into\nelementary school. A small minority of children express discomfort with their sexual anat-\nomy or will state the desire to have a sexual anatomy corresponding to the experienced\ngender (“anatomic dysphoria”). Expressions of anatomic dysphoria become more com-\nmon as children with gender dysphoria approach and anticipate puberty. \nRates of persistence of gender dysphoria from childhood into adolescence or adulthood\nvary. In natal males, persistence has ranged from 2.2% to 30%. In natal females, persistence\nhas ranged from 12% to 50%. Persistence of gender dysphoria is modestly correlated with\ndimensional measures of severity ascertained at the time of a childhood baseline assess-\nment. In one sample of natal males, lower socioeconomic background was also modestly\ncorrelated with persistence. It is unclear if particular therapeutic approaches to gender\ndysphoria in children are related to rates of long-term persistence. Extant follow-up sam-\nples consisted of children receiving no formal therapeutic intervention or receiving ther-\napeutic interventions of various types, ranging from active efforts to reduce gender\ndysphoria to a more neutral, “watchful waiting” approach. It is unclear if children “en-\ncouraged” or supported to live socially in the desired gender will show higher rates of per-\nsistence, since such children have not yet been followed longitudinally in a systematic\nmanner. For both natal male and female children showing persistence, almost all are\nsexually attracted to individuals of their natal sex. For natal male children whose gender\ndysphoria does not persist, the majority are androphilic (sexually attracted to males) and of-\nten self-identify as gay or homosexual (ranging from 63% to 100%). In natal female chil-\ndren whose gender dysphoria does not persist, the percentage who are gynephilic (sexually\nattracted to females) and self-identify as lesbian is lower (ranging from 32% to 50%).\nIn both adolescent and adult natal males, there are two broad trajectories for develop-\nment of gender dysphoria: early onset and late onset. Early-onset gender dysphoria starts in\nchildhood and continues into adolescence and adulthood; or, there is an intermittent pe-\nriod in which the gender dysphoria desists and these individuals self-identify as gay or ho-\nmosexual, followed by recurrence of gender dysphoria. Late-onset gender dysphoria occurs\naround puberty or much later in life. Some of these individuals report having had a desire\nto be of the other gender in childhood that was not expressed verbally to others. Others do\nnot recall any signs of childhood gender dysphoria. For adolescent males with late-onset\ngender dysphoria, parents often report surprise because they did not see signs of gender\n456\nGender Dysphoria\ndysphoria during childhood. Expressions of anatomic dysphoria are more common and\nsalient in adolescents and adults once secondary sex characteristics have developed. \nAdolescent and adult natal males with early-onset gender dysphoria are almost al-\nways sexually attracted to men (androphilic). Adolescents and adults with late-onset gen-\nder dysphoria frequently engage in transvestic behavior with sexual excitement. The\nmajority of these individuals are gynephilic or sexually attracted to other posttransition\nnatal males with late-onset gender dysphoria. A substantial percentage of adult males\nwith late-onset gender dysphoria cohabit with or are married to natal females. After gen-\nder transition, many self-identify as lesbian. Among adult natal males with gender dyspho-\nria, the early-onset group seeks out clinical care for hormone treatment and reassignment\nsurgery at an earlier age than does the late-onset group. The late-onset group may have more\nfluctuations in the degree of gender dysphoria and be more ambivalent about and less\nlikely satisfied after gender reassignment surgery. \nIn both adolescent and adult natal females, the most common course is the early-onset\nform of gender dysphoria. The late-onset form is much less common in natal females com-\npared with natal males. As in natal males with gender dysphoria, there may have been a\nperiod in which the gender dysphoria desisted and these individuals self-identified as les-\nbian; however, with recurrence of gender dysphoria, clinical consultation is sought, often\nwith the desire for hormone treatment and reassignment surgery. Parents of natal adoles-\ncent females with the late-onset form also report surprise, as no signs of childhood gender\ndysphoria were evident. Expressions of anatomic dysphoria are much more common and\nsalient in adolescents and adults than in children.\nAdolescent and adult natal females with early-onset gender dysphoria are almost\nalways gynephilic. Adolescents and adults with the late-onset form of gender dysphoria\nare usually androphilic and after gender transition self-identify as gay men. Natal females\nwith the late-onset form do not have co-occurring transvestic behavior with sexual ex-\ncitement. \nGender dysphoria in association with a disorder of sex development.\nMost individuals\nwith a disorder of sex development who develop gender dysphoria have already come to\nmedical attention at an early age. For many, starting at birth, issues of gender assignment\nwere raised by physicians and parents. Moreover, as infertility is quite common for this\ngroup, physicians are more willing to perform cross-sex hormone treatments and genital\nsurgery before adulthood.\nDisorders of sex development in general are frequently associated with gender-atypi-\ncal behavior starting in early childhood. However, in the majority of cases, this does not\nlead to gender dysphoria. As individuals with a disorder of sex development become\naware of their medical history and condition, many experience uncertainty about their\ngender, as opposed to developing a firm conviction that they are another gender. How-\never, most do not progress to gender transition. Gender dysphoria and gender transition\nmay vary considerably as a function of a disorder of sex development, its severity, and as-\nsigned gender. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nTemperamental.\nFor individuals with gender dysphoria without a disorder of sex de-\nvelopment, atypical gender behavior among individuals with early-onset gender dyspho-\nria develops in early preschool age, and it is possible that a high degree of atypicality\nmakes the development of gender dysphoria and its persistence into adolescence and\nadulthood more likely.\nEnvironmental.\nAmong individuals with gender dysphoria without a disorder of sex de-\nvelopment, males with gender dysphoria (in both childhood and adolescence) more com-\nmonly have older brothers than do males without the condition. Additional predisposing\nGender Dysphoria\n457\nfactors under consideration, especially in individuals with late-onset gender dysphoria (ad-\nolescence, adulthood), include habitual fetishistic transvestism developing into autogyne-\nphilia (i.e., sexual arousal associated with the thought or image of oneself as a woman) and\nother forms of more general social, psychological, or developmental problems.\nGenetic and physiological.\nFor individuals with gender dysphoria without a disorder of\nsex development, some genetic contribution is suggested by evidence for (weak) familial-\nity of transsexualism among nontwin siblings, increased concordance for transsexualism\nin monozygotic compared with dizygotic same-sex twins, and some degree of heritability\nof gender dysphoria. As to endocrine findings, no endogenous systemic abnormalities in\nsex-hormone levels have been found in 46,XY individuals, whereas there appear to be in-\ncreased androgen levels (in the range found in hirsute women but far below normal male\nlevels) in 46,XX individuals. Overall, current evidence is insufficient to label gender dys-\nphoria without a disorder of sex development as a form of intersexuality limited to the cen-\ntral nervous system.\nIn gender dysphoria associated with a disorder of sex development, the likelihood of\nlater gender dysphoria is increased if prenatal production and utilization (via receptor\nsensitivity) of androgens are grossly atypical relative to what is usually seen in individuals\nwith the same assigned gender. Examples include 46,XY individuals with a history of nor-\nmal male prenatal hormone milieu but inborn nonhormonal genital defects (as in cloacal\nbladder exstrophy or penile agenesis) and who have been assigned to the female gender.\nThe likelihood of gender dysphoria is further enhanced by additional, prolonged, highly\ngender-atypical postnatal androgen exposure with somatic virilization as may occur in fe-\nmale-raised and noncastrated 46,XY individuals with 5-alpha reductase-2 deficiency or\n17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-3 deficiency or in female-raised 46,XX individuals\nwith classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia with prolonged periods of non-adherence to\nglucocorticoid replacement therapy. However, the prenatal androgen milieu is more\nclosely related to gendered behavior than to gender identity. Many individuals with dis-\norders of sex development and markedly gender-atypical behavior do not develop gender\ndysphoria. Thus, gender-atypical behavior by itself should not be interpreted as an indi-\ncator of current or future gender dysphoria. There appears to be a higher rate of gender\ndysphoria and patient-initiated gender change from assigned female to male than from as-\nsigned male to female in 46,XY individuals with a disorder of sex development.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nIndividuals with gender dysphoria have been reported across many countries and cul-\ntures. The equivalent of gender dysphoria has also been reported in individuals living in\ncultures with institutionalized gender categories other than male or female. It is unclear\nwhether with these individuals the diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria would be met.\nDiagnostic Markers \nIndividuals with a somatic disorder of sex development show some correlation of final\ngender identity outcome with the degree of prenatal androgen production and utilization.\nHowever, the correlation is not robust enough for the biological factor, where ascertain-\nable, to replace a detailed and comprehensive diagnostic interview evaluation for gender\ndysphoria. \nFunctional Consequences of Gender Dysphoria\nPreoccupation with cross-gender wishes may develop at all ages after the first 2–3 years of\nchildhood and often interfere with daily activities. In older children, failure to develop\nage-typical same-sex peer relationships and skills may lead to isolation from peer groups\nand to distress. Some children may refuse to attend school because of teasing and harass-\n458\nGender Dysphoria\nment or pressure to dress in attire associated with their assigned sex. Also in adolescents\nand adults, preoccupation with cross-gender wishes often interferes with daily activities.\nRelationship difficulties, including sexual relationship problems, are common, and func-\ntioning at school or at work may be impaired. Gender dysphoria, along with atypical\ngender expression, is associated with high levels of stigmatization, discrimination, and\nvictimization, leading to negative self-concept, increased rates of mental disorder comor-\nbidity, school dropout, and economic marginalization, including unemployment, with at-\ntendant social and mental health risks, especially in individuals from resource-poor family\nbackgrounds. In addition, these individuals’ access to health services and mental health\nservices may be impeded by structural barriers, such as institutional discomfort or inex-\nperience in working with this patient population.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nNonconformity to gender roles.\nGender dysphoria should be distinguished from sim-\nple nonconformity to stereotypical gender role behavior by the strong desire to be of an-\nother gender than the assigned one and by the extent and pervasiveness of gender-variant\nactivities and interests. The diagnosis is not meant to merely describe nonconformity to\nstereotypical gender role behavior (e.g., “tomboyism” in girls, “girly-boy” behavior in\nboys, occasional cross-dressing in adult men). Given the increased openness of atypical\ngender expressions by individuals across the entire range of the transgender spectrum, it\nis important that the clinical diagnosis be limited to those individuals whose distress and\nimpairment meet the specified criteria.\nTransvestic disorder.\nTransvestic disorder occurs in heterosexual (or bisexual) adoles-\ncent and adult males (rarely in females) for whom cross-dressing behavior generates sex-\nual excitement and causes distress and/or impairment without drawing their primary\ngender into question. It is occasionally accompanied by gender dysphoria. An individual\nwith transvestic disorder who also has clinically significant gender dysphoria can be given\nboth diagnoses. In many cases of late-onset gender dysphoria in gynephilic natal males,\ntransvestic behavior with sexual excitement is a precursor.\nBody dysmorphic disorder.\nAn individual with body dysmorphic disorder focuses on\nthe alteration or removal of a specific body part because it is perceived as abnormally formed,\nnot because it represents a repudiated assigned gender. When an individual’s presenta-\ntion meets criteria for both gender dysphoria and body dysmorphic disorder, both diag-\nnoses can be given. Individuals wishing to have a healthy limb amputated (termed by\nsome body integrity identity disorder) because it makes them feel more “complete” usually\ndo not wish to change gender, but rather desire to live as an amputee or a disabled person.\nSchizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.\nIn schizophrenia, there may rarely be\ndelusions of belonging to some other gender. In the absence of psychotic symptoms, in-\nsistence by an individual with gender dysphoria that he or she is of some other gender is\nnot considered a delusion. Schizophrenia (or other psychotic disorders) and gender dys-\nphoria may co-occur.\nOther clinical presentations.\nSome individuals with an emasculinization desire who\ndevelop an alternative, nonmale/nonfemale gender identity do have a presentation that\nmeets criteria for gender dysphoria. However, some males seek castration and/or penec-\ntomy for aesthetic reasons or to remove psychological effects of androgens without chang-\ning male identity; in these cases, the criteria for gender dysphoria are not met. \nComorbidity \nClinically referred children with gender dysphoria show elevated levels of emotional and\nbehavioral problems—most commonly, anxiety, disruptive and impulse-control, and de-\nOther Specified Gender Dysphoria\n459\npressive disorders. In prepubertal children, increasing age is associated with having more\nbehavioral or emotional problems; this is related to the increasing non-acceptance of gen-\nder-variant behavior by others. In older children, gender-variant behavior often leads to\npeer ostracism, which may lead to more behavioral problems. The prevalence of mental\nhealth problems differs among cultures; these differences may also be related to differences\nin attitudes toward gender variance in children. However, also in some non-Western cul-\ntures, anxiety has been found to be relatively common in individuals with gender dysphoria,\neven in cultures with accepting attitudes toward gender-variant behavior. Autism spec-\ntrum disorder is more prevalent in clinically referred children with gender dysphoria than\nin the general population. Clinically referred adolescents with gender dysphoria appear to\nhave comorbid mental disorders, with anxiety and depressive disorders being the most\ncommon. As in children, autism spectrum disorder is more prevalent in clinically referred\nadolescents with gender dysphoria than in the general population. Clinically referred\nadults with gender dysphoria may have coexisting mental health problems, most commonly\nanxiety and depressive disorders.", "provenance": {"source_file": "gender_dysphoria_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 1, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.465382"}}
