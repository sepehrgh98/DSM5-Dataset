The diagnosis of insomnia disorder is given whether it occurs as an independent\ncondition or is comorbid with another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder),\nmedical condition (e.g., pain), or another sleep disorder (e.g., a breathing-related sleep dis-\norder). For instance, insomnia may develop its own course with some anxiety and depres-\nsive features but in the absence of criteria being met for any one mental disorder. Insomnia\nmay also manifest as a clinical feature of a more predominant mental disorder. Persistent\ninsomnia may even be a risk factor for depression and is a common residual symptom af-\nter treatment for this condition. With comorbid insomnia and a mental disorder, treatment\nmay also need to target both conditions. Given these different courses, it is often impossi-\nble to establish the precise nature of the relationship between these clinical entities, and\nthis relationship may change over time. Therefore, in the presence of insomnia and a co-\nmorbid disorder, it is not necessary to make a causal attribution between the two condi-\ntions. Rather, the diagnosis of insomnia disorder is made with concurrent specification of\nthe clinically comorbid conditions. A concurrent insomnia diagnosis should only be con-\nsidered when the insomnia is sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention;\notherwise, no separate diagnosis is necessary.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of insomnia disorder is dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality\nwith complaints of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep. The sleep complaints are ac-\ncompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other\nimportant areas of functioning. The sleep disturbance may occur during the course of an-\nother mental disorder or medical condition, or it may occur independently.\nDifferent manifestations of insomnia can occur at different times of the sleep period. Sleep-\nonset insomnia (or initial insomnia) involves difficulty initiating sleep at bedtime. Sleep mainte-\nnance insomnia (or middle insomnia) involves frequent or prolonged awakenings throughout\nthe night. Late insomnia involves early-morning awakening with an inability to return to sleep.\nDifficulty maintaining sleep is the most common single symptom of insomnia, followed by\ndifficulty falling asleep, while a combination of these symptoms is the most common presen-\ntation overall. The specific type of sleep complaint often varies over time. Individuals who\ncomplain of difficulty falling asleep at one time may later complain of difficulty maintaining\nsleep, and vice versa. Symptoms of difficulty falling asleep and difficulty maintaining sleep\ncan be quantified by the individual’s retrospective self-report, sleep diaries, or other methods,\nsuch as actigraphy or polysomnography, but the diagnosis of insomnia disorder is based on\nthe individual’s subjective perception of sleep or a caretaker’s report. \nNonrestorative sleep, a complaint of poor sleep quality that does not leave the individual\nrested upon awakening despite adequate duration, is a common sleep complaint usually\noccurring in association with difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or less frequently in\nisolation. This complaint can also be reported in association with other sleep disorders\n(e.g., breathing-related sleep disorder). When a complaint of nonrestorative sleep occurs\nin isolation (i.e., in the absence of difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep) but all di-\nagnostic criteria with regard to frequency, duration, and daytime distress and impairments\nare otherwise met, a diagnosis of other specified insomnia disorder or unspecified insom-\nnia disorder is made.\n364\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nAside from the frequency and duration criteria required to make the diagnosis, addi-\ntional criteria are useful to quantify insomnia severity. These quantitative criteria, while\narbitrary, are provided for illustrative purpose only. For instance, difficulty initiating sleep\nis defined by a subjective sleep latency greater than 20–30 minutes, and difficulty maintain-\ning sleep is defined by a subjective time awake after sleep onset greater than 20–30 min-\nutes. Although there is no standard definition of early-morning awakening, this symptom\ninvolves awakening at least 30 minutes before the scheduled time and before total sleep\ntime reaches 6½ hours. It is essential to take into account not only the final awakening time\nbut also the bedtime on the previous evening. Awakening at 4:00 A.M. does not have the\nsame clinical significance in those who go to bed at 9:00 P.M. as in those who go to bed at\n11:00 P.M. Such a symptom may also reflect an age-dependent decrease in the ability to sus-\ntain sleep or an age-dependent shift in the timing of the main sleep period. \nInsomnia disorder involves daytime impairments as well as nighttime sleep difficulties.\nThese include fatigue or, less commonly, daytime sleepiness; the latter is more common\namong older individuals and when insomnia is comorbid with another medical condition\n(e.g., chronic pain) or sleep disorder (e.g., sleep apnea). Impairment in cognitive performance\nmay include difficulties with attention, concentration and memory, and even with performing\nsimple manual skills. Associated mood disturbances are typically described as irritability or\nmood lability and less commonly as depressive or anxiety symptoms. Not all individuals with\nnighttime sleep disturbances are distressed or have functional impairment. For example, sleep\ncontinuity is often interrupted in healthy older adults who nevertheless identify themselves\nas good sleepers. A diagnosis of insomnia disorder should be reserved for those individuals\nwith significant daytime distress or impairment related to their nighttime sleep difficulties.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis \nInsomnia is often associated with physiological and cognitive arousal and conditioning\nfactors that interfere with sleep. A preoccupation with sleep and distress due to the inabil-\nity to sleep may lead to a vicious cycle: the more the individual strives to sleep, the more\nfrustration builds and further impairs sleep. Thus, excessive attention and efforts to sleep,\nwhich override normal sleep-onset mechanisms, may contribute to the development of in-\nsomnia. Individuals with persistent insomnia may also acquire maladaptive sleep habits\n(e.g., spending excessive time in bed; following an erratic sleep schedule; napping) and\ncognitions (e.g., fear of sleeplessness; apprehensions of daytime impairments; clock mon-\nitoring) during the course of the disorder. Engaging in such activities in an environment in\nwhich the individual has frequently spent sleepless nights may further compound the con-\nditioned arousal and perpetuate sleep difficulties. Conversely, the individual may fall asleep\nmore easily when not trying to do so. Some individuals also report better sleep when away\nfrom their own bedrooms and their usual routines. \nInsomnia may be accompanied by a variety of daytime complaints and symptoms, in-\ncluding fatigue, decreased energy, and mood disturbances. Symptoms of anxiety or de-\npression that do not meet criteria for a specific mental disorder may be present, as well as\nan excessive focus on the perceived effects of sleep loss on daytime functioning. \nIndividuals with insomnia may have elevated scores on self-report psychological or\npersonality inventories with profiles indicating mild depression and anxiety, a worrisome\ncognitive style, an emotion-focused and internalizing style of conflict resolution, and a so-\nmatic focus. Patterns of neurocognitive impairment among individuals with insomnia dis-\norder are inconsistent, although there may be impairments in performing tasks of higher\ncomplexity and those requiring frequent changes in performance strategy. Individuals\nwith insomnia often require more effort to maintain cognitive performance.\nPrevalence\nPopulation-based estimates indicate that about one-third of adults report insomnia symp-\ntoms, 10%–15% experience associated daytime impairments, and 6%–10% have symptoms\nInsomnia Disorder\n365\nthat meet criteria for insomnia disorder. Insomnia disorder is the most prevalent of all\nsleep disorders. In primary care settings, approximately 10%–20% of individuals complain\nof significant insomnia symptoms. Insomnia is a more prevalent complaint among fe-\nmales than among males, with a gender ratio of about 1.44:1. Although insomnia can be a\nsymptom or an independent disorder, it is most frequently observed as a comorbid con-\ndition with another medical condition or mental disorder. For instance, 40%–50% of indi-\nviduals with insomnia also present with a comorbid mental disorder. \nDevelopment and Course\nThe onset of insomnia symptoms can occur at any time during life, but the first episode is\nmore common in young adulthood. Less frequently, insomnia begins in childhood or ad-\nolescence. In women, new-onset insomnia may occur during menopause and persist even\nafter other symptoms (e.g., hot flashes) have resolved. Insomnia may have a late-life onset,\nwhich is often associated with the onset of other health-related conditions. \nInsomnia can be situational, persistent, or recurrent. Situational or acute insomnia usu-\nally lasts a few days or a few weeks and is often associated with life events or rapid changes\nin sleep schedules or environment. It usually resolves once the initial precipitating event\nsubsides. For some individuals, perhaps those more vulnerable to sleep disturbances, in-\nsomnia may persist long after the initial triggering event, possibly because of conditioning\nfactors and heightened arousal. The factors that precipitate insomnia may differ from\nthose that perpetuate it. For example, an individual who is bedridden with a painful injury\nand has difficulty sleeping may then develop negative associations for sleep. Conditioned\narousal may then persist and lead to persistent insomnia. A similar course may develop in\nthe context of an acute psychological stress or a mental disorder. For instance, insomnia that\noccurs during an episode of major depressive disorder can become a focus of attention,\nwith consequent negative conditioning, and persist even after resolution of the depressive\nepisode. In some cases, insomnia may also have an insidious onset without any identifi-\nable precipitating factor. \nThe course of insomnia may also be episodic, with recurrent episodes of sleep difficul-\nties associated with the occurrence of stressful events. Chronicity rates range from 45%\nto 75% for follow-ups of 1–7 years. Even when the course of the insomnia has become\nchronic, there is night-to-night variability in sleep patterns, with an occasional restful night’s\nsleep interspersed with several nights of poor sleep. The characteristics of insomnia may\nalso change over time. Many individuals with insomnia have a history of “light” or easily\ndisturbed sleep prior to onset of more persistent sleep problems.\nInsomnia complaints are more prevalent among middle-age and older adults. The type\nof insomnia symptom changes as a function of age, with difficulties initiating sleep being\nmore common among young adults and problems maintaining sleep occurring more fre-\nquently among middle-age and older individuals. \nDifficulties initiating and maintaining sleep can also occur in children and adolescents,\nbut there are more limited data on prevalence, risk factors, and comorbidity during these\ndevelopmental phases of the lifespan. Sleep difficulties in childhood can result from con-\nditioning factors (e.g., a child who does not learn to fall asleep or return to sleep without\nthe presence of a parent) or from the absence of consistent sleep schedules and bedtime\nroutines. Insomnia in adolescence is often triggered or exacerbated by irregular sleep sched-\nules (e.g., phase delay). In both children and adolescents, psychological and medical fac-\ntors can contribute to insomnia.\nThe increased prevalence of insomnia in older adults is partly explained by the higher\nincidence of physical health problems with aging. Changes in sleep patterns associated with\nthe normal developmental process must be differentiated from those exceeding age-related\nchanges. Although polysomnography is of limited value in the routine evaluation of in-\nsomnia, it may be more useful in the differential diagnosis among older adults because the\netiologies of insomnia (e.g., sleep apnea) are more often identifiable in older individuals.\n366\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nWhile the risk and prognostic factors discussed in this section increase vulnerability to in-\nsomnia, sleep disturbances are more likely to occur when predisposed individuals are ex-\nposed to precipitating events, such as major life events (e.g., illness, separation) or less\nsevere but more chronic daily stress. Most individuals resume normal sleep patterns after\nthe initial triggering event has disappeared, but others—perhaps those more vulnerable to\ninsomnia—continue experiencing persistent sleep difficulties. Perpetuating factors such as\npoor sleep habits, irregular sleep scheduling, and the fear of not sleeping feed into the in-\nsomnia problem and may contribute to a vicious cycle that may induce persistent insomnia.\nTemperamental.\nAnxiety or worry-prone personality or cognitive styles, increased arousal\npredisposition, and tendency to repress emotions can increase vulnerability to insomnia.\nEnvironmental.\nNoise, light, uncomfortably high or low temperature, and high altitude\nmay also increase vulnerability to insomnia.\nGenetic and physiological.\nFemale gender and advancing age are associated with in-\ncreased vulnerability to insomnia. Disrupted sleep and insomnia display a familial dispo-\nsition. The prevalence of insomnia is higher among monozygotic twins relative to\ndizygotic twins; it is also higher in first-degree family members compared with the general\npopulation. The extent to which this link is inherited through a genetic predisposition,\nlearned by observations of parental models, or established as a by-product of another psy-\nchopathology remains undetermined.\nCourse modifiers.\nDeleterious course modifiers include poor sleep hygiene practices\n(e.g., excessive caffeine use, irregular sleep schedules).\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nInsomnia is a more prevalent complaint among females than among males, with first onset\noften associated with the birth of a new child or with menopause. Despite higher preva-\nlence among older females, polysomnographic studies suggest better preservation of\nsleep continuity and slow-wave sleep in older females than in older males.\nDiagnostic Markers\nPolysomnography usually shows impairments of sleep continuity (e.g., increased sleep la-\ntency and time awake after sleep onset and decreased sleep efficiency [percentage of time\nin bed asleep] and may show increased stage 1 sleep and decreased stages 3 and 4 sleep.\nThe severity of these sleep impairments does not always match the individual’s clinical\npresentation or subjective complaint of poor sleep, as individuals with insomnia often un-\nderestimate sleep duration and overestimate wakefulness relative to polysomnography.\nQuantitative electroencephalographic analyses may indicate that individuals with insom-\nnia have greater high-frequency electroencephalography power relative to good sleepers\nboth around the sleep onset period and during non–rapid eye movement sleep, a feature\nsuggestive of increased cortical arousal. Individuals with insomnia disorder may have a\nlower sleep propensity and typically do not show increased daytime sleepiness on objec-\ntive sleep laboratory measures compared with individuals without sleep disorders. \nOther laboratory measures show evidence, although not consistently, of increased\narousal and a generalized activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (e.g., in-\ncreased cortisol levels, heart rate variability, reactivity to stress, metabolic rate). In general,\nfindings are consistent with the hypothesis that increased physiological and cognitive\narousal plays a significant role in insomnia disorder.\nIndividuals with insomnia disorder may appear either fatigued or haggard or, con-\nversely, overaroused and “wired.” However, there are no consistent or characteristic\nabnormalities on physical examination. There may be an increased incidence of stress-\nInsomnia Disorder\n367\nrelated psychophysiological symptoms (e.g., tension headache, muscle tension or pain,\ngastrointestinal symptoms).\nFunctional Consequences of Insomnia Disorder\nInterpersonal, social, and occupational problems may develop as a result of insomnia or\nexcessive concern with sleep, increased daytime irritability, and poor concentration. De-\ncreased attention and concentration are common and may be related to higher rates of ac-\ncidents observed in insomnia. Persistent insomnia is also associated with long-term\nconsequences, including increased risks of major depressive disorder, hypertension, and\nmyocardial infarction; increased absenteeism and reduced productivity at work; reduced\nquality of life; and increased economic burden. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nNormal sleep variations.\nNormal sleep duration varies considerably across individuals.\nSome individuals who require little sleep (“short sleepers”) may be concerned about their\nsleep duration. Short sleepers differ from individuals with insomnia disorder by the lack of\ndifficulty falling or staying asleep and by the absence of characteristic daytime symptoms\n(e.g., fatigue, concentration problems, irritability). However, some short sleepers may desire\nor attempt to sleep for a longer period of time and, by prolonging time in bed, may create an\ninsomnia-like sleep pattern. Clinical insomnia also should be distinguished from normal,\nage-related sleep changes. Insomnia must also be distinguished from sleep deprivation due\nto inadequate opportunity or circumstance for sleep resulting, for example, from an emer-\ngency or from professional or family obligations forcing the individual to stay awake. \nSituational/acute insomnia.\nSituational/acute insomnia is a condition lasting a few days\nto a few weeks, often associated with life events or with changes in sleep schedules. These\nacute or short-term insomnia symptoms may also produce significant distress and inter-\nfere with social, personal, and occupational functioning. When such symptoms are fre-\nquent enough and meet all other criteria except for the 3-month duration, a diagnosis of\nother specified insomnia disorder or unspecified insomnia disorder is made.\nDelayed sleep phase and shift work types of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder.\nIndividuals with the delayed sleep phase type of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder re-\nport sleep-onset insomnia only when they try to sleep at socially normal times, but they do\nnot report difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep when their bed and rising times are\ndelayed and coincide with their endogenous circadian rhythm. Shift work type differs from\ninsomnia disorder by the history of recent shift work. \nRestless legs syndrome.\nRestless legs syndrome often produces difficulties initiating\nand maintaining sleep. However, an urge to move the legs and any accompanying unpleas-\nant leg sensations are features that differentiate this disorder from insomnia disorder. \nBreathing-related sleep disorders.\nMost individuals with a breathing-related sleep dis-\norder have a history of loud snoring, breathing pauses during sleep, and excessive daytime\nsleepiness. Nonetheless, as many as 50% of individuals with sleep apnea may also report\ninsomnia symptoms, a feature that is more common among females and older adults.\nNarcolepsy.\nNarcolepsy may cause insomnia complaints but is distinguished from in-\nsomnia disorder by the predominance of symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, cat-\naplexy, sleep paralysis, and sleep-related hallucinations.\nParasomnias.\nParasomnias are characterized by a complaint of unusual behavior or events\nduring sleep that may lead to intermittent awakenings and difficulty resuming sleep.\nHowever, it is these behavioral events, rather than the insomnia per se, that dominate the\nclinical picture. \n368\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nSubstance/medication-induced sleep disorder, insomnia type.\nSubstance/medication-\ninduced sleep disorder, insomnia type, is distinguished from insomnia disorder by the fact\nthat a substance (i.e., a drug of abuse, a medication, or exposure to a toxin) is judged to be\netiologically related to the insomnia (see “Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disor-\nder” later in this chapter). For example, insomnia occurring only in the context of heavy\ncoffee consumption would be diagnosed as caffeine-induced sleep disorder, insomnia\ntype, with onset during intoxication.\nComorbidity\nInsomnia is a common comorbidity of many medical conditions, including diabetes, cor-\nonary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arthritis, fibromyalgia, and\nother chronic pain conditions. The risk relationship appears to be bidirectional: insomnia\nincreases the risk of medical conditions, and medical problems increase the risk of insom-\nnia. The direction of the relationship is not always clear and may change over time; for this\nreason, comorbid insomnia is the preferred terminology in the presence of coexisting in-\nsomnia with another medical condition (or mental disorder).\nIndividuals with insomnia disorder frequently have a comorbid mental disorder, par-\nticularly bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders. Persistent insomnia represents a risk\nfactor or an early symptom of subsequent bipolar, depressive, anxiety, and substance use\ndisorders. Individuals with insomnia may misuse medications or alcohol to help with\nnighttime sleep, anxiolytics to combat tension or anxiety, and caffeine or other stimulants\nto combat excessive fatigue. In addition to worsening the insomnia, this type of substance\nuse may in some cases progress to a substance use disorder.\nRelationship to International Classification of \nSleep Disorders\nThere are several distinct insomnia phenotypes relating to the perceived source of the in-\nsomnia that are recognized by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition\n(ICSD-2). These include psychophysiological insomnia, idiopathic insomnia, sleep-state mispercep-\ntion, and inadequate sleep hygiene. Despite their clinical appeal and heuristic value, there is\nlimited evidence to support these distinct phenotypes.", "provenance": {"source_file": "sleep_wake_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 1, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.543350"}}

Individuals with this disorder fall asleep quickly and\nhave a good sleep efficiency (>90%). They may have difficulty waking up in the morning,\nsometimes appearing confused, combative, or ataxic. This prolonged impairment of alert-\nness at the sleep-wake transition is often referred to as sleep inertia (i.e., sleep drunkenness).\nIt can also occur upon awakening from a daytime nap. During that period, the individual\nappears awake, but there is a decline in motor dexterity, behavior may be very inappro-\npriate, and memory deficits, disorientation in time and space, and feelings of grogginess\nmay occur. This period may last some minutes to hours. \nThe persistent need for sleep can lead to automatic behavior (usually of a very routine,\nlow-complexity type) that the individual carries out with little or no subsequent recall. For\nexample, individuals may find themselves having driven several miles from where they\nthought they were, unaware of the “automatic” driving they did in the preceding minutes.\nFor some individuals with hypersomnolence disorder, the major sleep episode (for most\nindividuals, nocturnal sleep) has a duration of 9 hours or more. However, the sleep is often\nnonrestorative and is followed by difficulty awakening in the morning. For other individ-\nuals with hypersomnolence disorder, the major sleep episode is of normal nocturnal sleep\nduration (6–9 hours). In these cases, the excessive sleepiness is characterized by several un-\nintentional daytime naps. These daytime naps tend to be relatively long (often lasting 1 hour\nor more), are experienced as nonrestorative (i.e., unrefreshing), and do not lead to improved\nalertness. Individuals with hypersomnolence have daytime naps nearly everyday regard-\nless of the nocturnal sleep duration. Subjective sleep quality may or may not be reported as\ngood. Individuals typically feel sleepiness developing over a period of time, rather than\n370\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nexperiencing a sudden sleep “attack.” Unintentional sleep episodes typically occur in low-\nstimulation and low-activity situations (e.g., while attending lectures, reading, watching\ntelevision, or driving long distances), but in more severe cases they can manifest in high-\nattention situations such as at work, in meetings, or at social gatherings.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nNonrestorative sleep, automatic behavior, difficulties awakening in the morning, and\nsleep inertia, although common in hypersomnolence disorder, may also be seen in a variety\nof conditions, including narcolepsy. Approximately 80% of individuals with hyper-\nsomnolence report that their sleep is nonrestorative, and as many have difficulties awak-\nening in the morning. Sleep inertia, though less common (i.e., observed in 36%–50% of\nindividuals with hypersomnolence disorder), is highly specific to hypersomnolence. Short\nnaps (i.e., duration of less than 30 minutes) are often unrefreshing. Individuals with hy-\npersomnolence often appear sleepy and may even fall asleep in the clinician’s waiting\narea. \nA subset of individuals with hypersomnolence disorder have a family history of hy-\npersomnolence and also have symptoms of autonomic nervous system dysfunction, in-\ncluding recurrent vascular-type headaches, reactivity of the peripheral vascular system\n(Raynaud’s phenomenon), and fainting.\nPrevalence\nApproximately 5%–10% of individuals who consult in sleep disorders clinics with com-\nplaints of daytime sleepiness are diagnosed as having hypersomnolence disorder. It is es-\ntimated that about 1% of the European and U.S. general population has episodes of sleep\ninertia. Hypersomnolence occurs with relatively equal frequency in males and females.\nDevelopment and Course\nHypersomnolence disorder has a persistent course, with a progressive evolution in the se-\nverity of symptoms. In most extreme cases, sleep episodes can last up to 20 hours. How-\never, the average nighttime sleep duration is around 9½ hours. While many individuals\nwith hypersomnolence are able to reduce their sleep time during working days, weekend\nand holiday sleep is greatly increased (by up to 3 hours). Awakenings are very difficult\nand accompanied by sleep inertia episodes in nearly 40% of cases. Hypersomnolence fully\nmanifests in most cases in late adolescence or early adulthood, with a mean age at onset of\n17–24 years. Individuals with hypersomnolence disorder are diagnosed, on average, 10–15\nyears after the appearance of the first symptoms. Pediatric cases are rare. \nHypersomnolence has a progressive onset, with symptoms beginning between ages 15\nand 25 years, with a gradual progression over weeks to months. For most individuals, the\ncourse is then persistent and stable, unless treatment is initiated. The development of other\nsleep disorders (e.g., breathing-related sleep disorder) may worsen the degree of sleepi-\nness. Although hyperactivity may be one of the presenting signs of daytime sleepiness in\nchildren, voluntary napping increases with age. This normal phenomenon is distinct from\nhypersomnolence.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nEnvironmental.\nHypersomnolence can be increased temporarily by psychological stress\nand alcohol use, but they have not been documented as environmental precipitating\nfactors. Viral infections have been reported to have preceded or accompanied hyper-\nsomnolence in about 10% of cases. Viral infections, such as HIV pneumonia, infectious\nmononucleosis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome, can also evolve into hypersomnolence within\nHypersomnolence Disorder\n371\nmonths after the infection. Hypersomnolence can also appear within 6–18 months follow-\ning a head trauma. \nGenetic and physiological.\nHypersomnolence may be familial, with an autosomal-\ndominant mode of inheritance. \nDiagnostic Markers\nNocturnal polysomnography demonstrates a normal to prolonged sleep duration, short\nsleep latency, and normal to increased sleep continuity. The distribution of rapid eye\nmovement (REM) sleep is also normal. Sleep efficiency is mostly greater than 90%. Some\nindividuals with hypersomnolence disorder have increased amounts of slow-wave sleep.\nThe multiple sleep latency test documents sleep tendency, typically indicated by mean\nsleep latency values of less than 8 minutes. In hypersomnolence disorder, the mean sleep\nlatency is typically less than 10 minutes and frequently 8 minutes or less. Sleep-onset REM\nperiods (SOREMPs; i.e., the occurrence of REM sleep within 20 minutes of sleep onset)\nmay be present but occur less than two times in four to five nap opportunities. \nFunctional Consequences of Hypersomnolence Disorder\nThe low level of alertness that occurs while an individual fights the need for sleep can lead\nto reduced efficiency, diminished concentration, and poor memory during daytime activ-\nities. Hypersomnolence can lead to significant distress and dysfunction in work and social\nrelationships. Prolonged nocturnal sleep and difficulty awakening can result in difficulty\nin meeting morning obligations, such as arriving at work on time. Unintentional daytime\nsleep episodes can be embarrassing and even dangerous, if, for instance, the individual is\ndriving or operating machinery when the episode occurs. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nNormative variation in sleep.\n“Normal” sleep duration varies considerably in the general\npopulation. “Long sleepers” (i.e., individuals who require a greater than average amount\nof sleep) do not have excessive sleepiness, sleep inertia, or automatic behavior when they\nobtain their required amount of nocturnal sleep. Sleep is reported to be refreshing. If social\nor occupational demands lead to shorter nocturnal sleep, daytime symptoms may appear.\nIn hypersomnolence disorder, by contrast, symptoms of excessive sleepiness occur regard-\nless of nocturnal sleep duration. An inadequate amount of nocturnal sleep, or behaviorally\ninduced insufficient sleep syndrome, can produce symptoms of daytime sleepiness very similar\nto those of hypersomnolence. An average sleep duration of fewer than 7 hours per night\nstrongly suggests inadequate nocturnal sleep, and an average of more than 9–10 hours of\nsleep per 24-hour period suggests hypersomnolence. Individuals with inadequate noctur-\nnal sleep typically “catch up” with longer sleep durations on days when they are free from\nsocial or occupational demands or on vacations. Unlike hypersomnolence, insufficient\nnocturnal sleep is unlikely to persist unabated for decades. A diagnosis of hypersomno-\nlence disorder should not be made if there is a question regarding the adequacy of noctur-\nnal sleep duration. A diagnostic and therapeutic trial of sleep extension for 10–14 days can\noften clarify the diagnosis.\nPoor sleep quality and fatigue.\nHypersomnolence disorder should be distinguished\nfrom excessive sleepiness related to insufficient sleep quantity or quality and fatigue (i.e.,\ntiredness not necessarily relieved by increased sleep and unrelated to sleep quantity or\nquality). Excessive sleepiness and fatigue are difficult to differentiate and may overlap\nconsiderably. \nBreathing-related sleep disorders.\nIndividuals with hypersomnolence and breathing-\nrelated sleep disorders may have similar patterns of excessive sleepiness. Breathing-\n372\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nrelated sleep disorders are suggested by a history of loud snoring, pauses in breathing\nduring sleep, brain injury, or cardiovascular disease and by the presence of obesity, oro-\npharyngeal anatomical abnormalities, hypertension, or heart failure on physical examina-\ntion. Polysomnographic studies can confirm the presence of apneic events in breathing-\nrelated sleep disorder (and their absence in hypersomnolence disorder).\nCircadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders.\nCircadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders are\noften characterized by daytime sleepiness. A history of an abnormal sleep-wake schedule\n(with shifted or irregular hours) is present in individuals with a circadian rhythm sleep-\nwake disorder. \nParasomnias.\nParasomnias rarely produce the prolonged, undisturbed nocturnal sleep\nor daytime sleepiness characteristic of hypersomnolence disorder.\nOther mental disorders.\nHypersomnolence disorder must be distinguished from mental\ndisorders that include hypersomnolence as an essential or associated feature. In particular,\ncomplaints of daytime sleepiness may occur in a major depressive episode, with atypical fea-\ntures, and in the depressed phase of bipolar disorder. Assessment for other mental disorders is\nessential before a diagnosis of hypersomnolence disorder is considered. A diagnosis of hyper-\nsomnolence disorder can be made in the presence of another current or past mental disorder. \nComorbidity\nHypersomnolence can be associated with depressive disorders, bipolar disorders (during a\ndepressive episode), and major depressive disorder, with seasonal pattern. Many individu-\nals with hypersomnolence disorder have symptoms of depression that may meet criteria for\na depressive disorder. This presentation may be related to the psychosocial consequences of\npersistent increased sleep need. Individuals with hypersomnolence disorder are also at\nrisk for substance-related disorders, particularly related to self-medication with stimulants.\nThis general lack of specificity may contribute to very heterogeneous profiles among indi-\nviduals whose symptoms meet the same diagnostic criteria for hypersomnolence disorder.\nNeurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and mul-\ntiple system atrophy, may also be associated with hypersomnolence. \nRelationship to International Classification of \nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), differentiates nine\nsubtypes of “hypersomnias of central origin,” including recurrent hypersomnia (Kleine-\nLevin syndrome).", "provenance": {"source_file": "sleep_wake_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 2, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.544327"}}

Nocturnal sleep polysomnography showing rapid eye movement (REM) sleep la-\ntency less than or equal to 15 minutes, or a multiple sleep latency test showing a\nmean sleep latency less than or equal to 8 minutes and two or more sleep-onset\nREM periods.\nSpecify whether:\n347.00 (G47.419) Narcolepsy without cataplexy but with hypocretin deficiency: Cri-\nterion B requirements of low CSF hypocretin-1 levels and positive polysomnography/\nmultiple sleep latency test are met, but no cataplexy is present (Criterion B1 not met).\n347.01 (G47.411) Narcolepsy with cataplexy but without hypocretin deficiency:\nIn this rare subtype (less than 5% of narcolepsy cases), Criterion B requirements of\ncataplexy and positive polysomnography/multiple sleep latency test are met, but CSF\nhypocretin-1 levels are normal (Criterion B2 not met).\n347.00 (G47.419) Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, deafness, and narco-\nlepsy: This subtype is caused by exon 21 DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase-1 mu-\ntations and is characterized by late-onset (age 30–40 years) narcolepsy (with low or\nintermediate CSF hypocretin-1 levels), deafness, cerebellar ataxia, and eventually de-\nmentia. \n347.00 (G47.419) Autosomal dominant narcolepsy, obesity, and type 2 diabetes:\nNarcolepsy, obesity, and type 2 diabetes and low CSF hypocretin-1 levels have been\ndescribed in rare cases and are associated with a mutation in the myelin oligodendro-\ncyte glycoprotein gene.\n347.10 (G47.429) Narcolepsy secondary to another medical condition: This sub-\ntype is for narcolepsy that develops secondary to medical conditions that cause infec-\ntious (e.g., Whipple’s disease, sarcoidosis), traumatic, or tumoral destruction of\nhypocretin neurons.\nCoding note (for ICD-9-CM code 347.10 only): Code first the underlying medical con-\ndition (e.g., 040.2 Whipple’s disease; 347.10 narcolepsy secondary to Whipple’s dis-\nease).\nSpecify current severity:\nMild: Infrequent cataplexy (less than once per week), need for naps only once or twice\nper day, and less disturbed nocturnal sleep.\nModerate: Cataplexy once daily or every few days, disturbed nocturnal sleep, and\nneed for multiple naps daily.\nSevere: Drug-resistant cataplexy with multiple attacks daily, nearly constant sleepi-\nness, and disturbed nocturnal sleep (i.e., movements, insomnia, and vivid dreaming).\nSubtypes\nIn narcolepsy without cataplexy but with hypocretin deficiency, unclear “cataplexy-like”\nsymptoms may be reported (e.g., the symptoms are not triggered by emotions and are un-\nusually long lasting). In extremely rare cases, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of hypocre-\ntin-1 are low, and polysomnographic/multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) results are\nnegative: repeating the test is advised before establishing the subtype diagnosis. In narco-\n374\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nlepsy with cataplexy but without hypocretin deficiency, test results for human leukocyte\nantigen (HLA) DQB1*06:02 may be negative. Seizures, falls of other origin, and conversion\ndisorder (functional neurological symptom disorder) should be excluded. In narcolepsy\nsecondary to infectious (e.g., Whipple’s disease, sarcoidosis), traumatic, or tumoral de-\nstruction of hypocretin neurons, test results for HLA DQB1*06:02 may be positive and may\nresult from the insult triggering the autoimmune process. In other cases, the destruction of\nhypocretin neurons may be secondary to trauma or hypothalamic surgery. Head trauma\nor infections of the central nervous system can, however, produce transitory decreases in\nCSF hypocretin-1 levels without hypocretin cell loss, complicating the diagnosis.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential features of sleepiness in narcolepsy are recurrent daytime naps or lapses into\nsleep. Sleepiness typically occurs daily but must occur at a minimum three times a week\nfor at least 3 months (Criterion A). Narcolepsy generally produces cataplexy, which most\ncommonly presents as brief episodes (seconds to minutes) of sudden, bilateral loss of mus-\ncle tone precipitated by emotions, typically laughing and joking. Muscles affected may\ninclude those of the neck, jaw, arms, legs, or whole body, resulting in head bobbing, jaw\ndropping, or complete falls. Individuals are awake and aware during cataplexy. To meet\nCriterion B1(a), cataplexy must be triggered by laughter or joking and must occur at least\na few times per month when the condition is untreated or in the past.\nCataplexy should not be confused with “weakness” occurring in the context of athletic\nactivities (physiological) or exclusively after unusual emotional triggers such as stress or\nanxiety (suggesting possible psychopathology). Episodes lasting hours or days, or those not\ntriggered by emotions, are unlikely to be cataplexy, nor is rolling on the floor while laugh-\ning hysterically.\nIn children close to onset, genuine cataplexy can be atypical, affecting primarily the\nface, causing grimaces or jaw opening with tongue thrusting (“cataplectic faces”). Alter-\nnatively, cataplexy may present as low-grade continuous hypotonia, yielding a wobbling\nwalk. In these cases, Criterion B1(b) can be met in children or in individuals within 6 months\nof a rapid onset.\nNarcolepsy-cataplexy nearly always results from the loss of hypothalamic hypocretin\n(orexin)–producing cells, causing hypocretin deficiency (less than or equal to one-third of\ncontrol values, or 110 pg/mL in most laboratories). Cell loss is likely autoimmune, and ap-\nproximately 99% of affected individuals carry HLA-DQB1*06:02 (vs. 12%–38% of control\nsubjects). Thus, checking for the presence of DQB1*06:02 prior to a lumbar puncture for eval-\nuation of CSF hypocretin-1 immunoreactivity may be useful. Rarely, low CSF levels of hypo-\ncretin-1 occur without cataplexy, notably in youths who may develop cataplexy later. CSF\nhypocretin-1 measurement represents the gold standard, excepting associated severe con-\nditions (neurological, inflammatory, infectious, trauma) that can interfere with the assay.\nA nocturnal polysomnographic sleep study followed by an MSLT can also be used to\nconfirm the diagnosis (Criterion B3). These tests must be performed after the individual\nhas stopped all psychotropic medications, following 2 weeks of adequate sleep time (as\ndocumented with sleep diaries, actigraphy). Short rapid eye movement (REM) latency\n(sleep-onset REM period, REM latency less than or equal to 15 minutes) during polysom-\nnography is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis and meets Criterion B3. Alternatively, the\nMSLT result must be positive, showing a mean sleep latency of less than or equal to 8 min-\nutes and two or more sleep-onset REM periods in four to five naps.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis \nWhen sleepiness is severe, automatic behaviors may occur, with the individual continuing\nhis or her activities in a semi-automatic, hazelike fashion without memory or conscious-\nness. Approximately 20%–60% of individuals experience vivid hypnagogic hallucinations\nNarcolepsy\n375\nbefore or upon falling asleep or hypnopompic hallucinations just after awakening. These\nhallucinations are distinct from the less vivid, nonhallucinatory dreamlike mentation at\nsleep onset that occurs in normal sleepers. Nightmares and vivid dreaming are also fre-\nquent in narcolepsy, as is REM sleep behavior disorder. Approximately 20%–60% of indi-\nviduals experience sleep paralysis upon falling asleep or awakening, leaving them awake\nbut unable to move or speak. However, many normal sleepers also report sleep paralysis,\nespecially with stress or sleep deprivation. Nocturnal eating may occur. Obesity is com-\nmon. Nocturnal sleep disruption with frequent long or short awakenings is common and\ncan be disabling.\nIndividuals may appear sleepy or fall asleep in the waiting area or during clinical ex-\namination. During cataplexy, individuals may slump in a chair and have slurred speech or\ndrooping eyelids. If the clinician has time to check reflexes during cataplexy (most attacks\nare less than 10 seconds), reflexes are abolished—an important finding distinguishing gen-\nuine cataplexy from conversion disorder. \nPrevalence\nNarcolepsy-cataplexy affects 0.02%–0.04% of the general population in most countries.\nNarcolepsy affects both genders, with possibly a slight male preponderance. \nDevelopment and Course \nOnset is typically in children and adolescents/young adults but rarely in older adults.\nTwo peaks of onset are suggested, at ages 15–25 years and ages 30–35 years. Onset can be\nabrupt or progressive (over years). Severity is highest when onset is abrupt in children,\nand then decreases with age or with treatment, so that symptoms such as cataplexy can oc-\ncasionally disappear. Abrupt onset in young, prepubescent children can be associated\nwith obesity and premature puberty, a phenotype more frequently observed since 2009. In\nadolescents, onset is more difficult to pinpoint. Onset in adults is often unclear, with some\nindividuals reporting having had excessive sleepiness since birth. Once the disorder has\nmanifested, the course is persistent and lifelong.\nIn 90% of cases, the first symptom to manifest is sleepiness or increased sleep, followed\nby cataplexy (within 1 year in 50% of cases, within 3 years in 85%). Sleepiness, hypnagogic\nhallucinations, vivid dreaming, and REM sleep behavior disorder (excessive movements\nduring REM sleep) are early symptoms. Excessive sleep rapidly progresses to an inability\nto stay awake during the day, and to maintain good sleep at night, without a clear increase\nin total 24-hour sleep needs. In the first months, cataplexy may be atypical, especially in\nchildren. Sleep paralysis usually develops around puberty in children with prepubertal\nonset. Exacerbations of symptoms suggest lack of compliance with medications or devel-\nopment of a concurrent sleep disorder, notably sleep apnea.\nYoung children and adolescents with narcolepsy often develop aggression or behav-\nioral problems secondary to sleepiness and/or nighttime sleep disruption. Workload and\nsocial pressure increase through high school and college, reducing available sleep time at\nnight. Pregnancy does not seem to modify symptoms consistently. After retirement, indi-\nviduals typically have more opportunity for napping, reducing the need for stimulants.\nMaintaining a regular schedule benefits individuals at all ages. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nTemperamental.\nParasomnias, such as sleepwalking, bruxism, REM sleep behavior dis-\norder, and enuresis, may be more common in individuals who develop narcolepsy. Indi-\nviduals commonly report that they need more sleep than other family members. \nEnvironmental.\nGroup A streptococcal throat infection, influenza (notably pandemic\nH1N1 2009), or other winter infections are likely triggers of the autoimmune process, pro-\n376\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nducing narcolepsy a few months later. Head trauma and abrupt changes in sleep-wake\npatterns (e.g., job changes, stress) may be additional triggers. \nGenetic and physiological.\nMonozygotic twins are 25%–32% concordant for narcolepsy.\nThe prevalence of narcolepsy is 1%–2% in first-degree relatives (a 10- to 40-fold increase\noverall). Narcolepsy is strongly associated with DQB1*06:02 (99% vs. 12%–38% in control\nsubjects of various ethnic groups; 25% in the general U.S. population). DQB1*03:01 in-\ncreases, while DQB1*05:01, DQB1*06:01, and DQB1*06:03 reduce risk in the presence of\nDQB1*06:02, but the effect is small. Polymorphisms within the T-cell receptor alpha gene\nand other immune modulating genes also modulate risk slightly.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nNarcolepsy has been described in all ethnic groups and in many cultures. Among African\nAmericans, more cases present without cataplexy or with atypical cataplexy, complicating\ndiagnosis, especially in the presence of obesity and obstructive sleep apnea.\nDiagnostic Markers\nFunctional imaging suggests impaired hypothalamic responses to humorous stimuli.\nNocturnal polysomnography followed by an MSLT is used to confirm the diagnosis of\nnarcolepsy, especially when the disorder is first being diagnosed and before treatment has\nbegun, and if hypocretin deficiency has not been documented biochemically. The poly-\nsomnography/MSLT should be performed after the individual is no longer taking any\npsychotropic drugs and after regular sleep-wake patterns, without shift work or sleep de-\nprivation, have been documented.\nA sleep-onset REM period during the polysomnography (REM sleep latency less than\nor equal to 15 minutes) is highly specific (approximately 1% positive in control subjects)\nbut moderately sensitive (approximately 50%). A positive MSLT result displays an aver-\nage sleep latency of less than or equal to 8 minutes, and sleep-onset REM periods in two or\nmore naps on a four- or five-nap test. The MSLT result is positive in 90%–95% of individ-\nuals with narcolepsy versus 2%–4% of control subjects or individuals with other sleep dis-\norders. Additional polysomnographic findings often include frequent arousals, decreased\nsleep efficiency, and increased stage 1 sleep. Periodic limb movements (found in about\n40% of individuals with narcolepsy) and sleep apnea are often noted.\nHypocretin deficiency is demonstrated by measuring CSF hypocretin-1 immunoreac-\ntivity. The test is particularly useful in individuals with suspected conversion disorder\nand those without typical cataplexy, or in treatment-refractory cases. The diagnostic value\nof the test is not affected by medications, sleep deprivation, or circadian time, but the find-\nings are uninterpretable when the individual is severely ill with a concurrent infection or\nhead trauma or is comatose. CSF cytology, protein, and glucose are within normal range\neven when sampled within weeks of rapid onset. CSF hypocretin-1 in these incipient cases\nis typically already very diminished or undetectable.\nFunctional Consequences of Narcolepsy \nDriving and working are impaired, and individuals with narcolepsy should avoid jobs\nthat place themselves (e.g., working with machinery) or others (e.g., bus driver, pilot) in\ndanger. Once the narcolepsy is controlled with therapy, patients can usually drive, al-\nthough rarely long distances alone. Untreated individuals are also at risk for social isola-\ntion and accidental injury to themselves or others. Social relations may suffer as these\nindividuals strive to avert cataplexy by exerting control over emotions. \nDifferential Diagnosis \nOther hypersomnias.\nHypersomnolence and narcolepsy are similar with respect to the\ndegree of daytime sleepiness, age at onset, and stable course over time but can be distin-\nNarcolepsy\n377\nguished based on distinctive clinical and laboratory features. Individuals with hypersom-\nnolence typically have longer and less disrupted nocturnal sleep, greater difficulty\nawakening, more persistent daytime sleepiness (as opposed to more discrete “sleep at-\ntacks” in narcolepsy), longer and less refreshing daytime sleep episodes, and little or no\ndreaming during daytime naps. By contrast, individuals with narcolepsy have cataplexy\nand recurrent intrusions of elements of REM sleep into the transition between sleep and\nwakefulness (e.g., sleep-related hallucinations and sleep paralysis). The MSLT typically\ndemonstrates shorter sleep latencies (i.e., greater physiological sleepiness) as well as the\npresence of multiple sleep-onset REM periods in individuals with narcolepsy.\nSleep deprivation and insufficient nocturnal sleep.\nSleep deprivation and insufficient\nnocturnal sleep are common in adolescents and shift workers. In adolescents, difficulties\nfalling asleep at night are common, causing sleep deprivation. The MSLT result may be\npositive if conducted while the individual is sleep deprived or while his or her sleep is\nphase delayed. \nSleep apnea syndromes.\nSleep apneas are especially likely in the presence of obesity.\nBecause obstructive sleep apnea is more frequent than narcolepsy, cataplexy may be over-\nlooked (or absent), and the individual is assumed to have obstructive sleep apnea unre-\nsponsive to usual therapies. \nMajor depressive disorder.\nNarcolepsy or hypersomnia may be associated or confused\nwith depression. Cataplexy is not present in depression. The MSLT results are most often\nnormal, and there is dissociation between subjective and objective sleepiness, as measured\nby the mean sleep latency during the MSLT.\nConversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).\nAtypical features,\nsuch as long-lasting cataplexy or unusual triggers, may be present in conversion disorder\n(functional neurological symptom disorder). Individuals may report sleeping and dream-\ning, yet the MSLT does not show the characteristic sleep-onset REM period. Full-blown,\nlong-lasting pseudocataplexy may occur during consultation, allowing the examining\nphysician enough time to verify reflexes, which remain intact. \nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or other behavioral problems.\nIn children and\nadolescents, sleepiness can cause behavioral problems, including aggressiveness and in-\nattention, leading to a misdiagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nSeizures.\nIn young children, cataplexy can be misdiagnosed as seizures. Seizures are not\ncommonly triggered by emotions, and when they are, the trigger is not usually laughing or\njoking. During a seizure, individuals are more likely to hurt themselves when falling. Sei-\nzures characterized by isolated atonia are rarely seen in isolation of other seizures, and\nthey also have signatures on the electroencephalogram. \nChorea and movement disorders.\nIn young children, cataplexy can be misdiagnosed as\nchorea or pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal\ninfections, especially in the context of a strep throat infection and high antistreptolysin O\nantibody levels. Some children may have an overlapping movement disorder close to on-\nset of the cataplexy.\nSchizophrenia.\nIn the presence of florid and vivid hypnagogic hallucinations, individuals\nmay think these experiences are real—a feature that suggests schizophrenia. Similarly,\nwith stimulant treatment, persecutory delusions may develop. If cataplexy is present, the\nclinician should first assume that these symptoms are secondary to narcolepsy before con-\nsidering a co-occurring diagnosis of schizophrenia. \nComorbidity\nNarcolepsy can co-occur with bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders, and in rare cases\nwith schizophrenia. Narcolepsy is also associated with increased body mass index or obe-\n378\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nsity, especially when the narcolepsy is untreated. Rapid weight gain is common in young\nchildren with a sudden disease onset. Comorbid sleep apnea should be considered if there\nis a sudden aggravation of preexisting narcolepsy.\nRelationship to International Classification of \nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), differentiates five\nsubtypes of narcolepsy.\nBreathing-Related Sleep Disorders\nThe breathing-related sleep disorders category encompasses three relatively distinct dis-\norders: obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, central sleep apnea, and sleep-related hypo-\nventilation.", "provenance": {"source_file": "sleep_wake_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 3, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.544327"}}

Either (1) or (2): \n1. Evidence by polysomnography of at least five obstructive apneas or hypopneas per\nhour of sleep and either of the following sleep symptoms:\na. Nocturnal breathing disturbances: snoring, snorting/gasping, or breathing\npauses during sleep.\nb. Daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or unrefreshing sleep despite sufficient opportuni-\nties to sleep that is not better explained by another mental disorder (including a\nsleep disorder) and is not attributable to another medical condition.\n2. Evidence by polysomnography of 15 or more obstructive apneas and/or hypopneas\nper hour of sleep regardless of accompanying symptoms.\nSpecify current severity:\nMild: Apnea hypopnea index is less than 15.\nModerate: Apnea hypopnea index is 15–30.\nSevere: Apnea hypopnea index is greater than 30.\nSpecifiers\nDisease severity is measured by a count of the number of apneas plus hypopneas per hour\nof sleep (apnea hypopnea index) using polysomnography or other overnight monitoring.\nOverall severity is also informed by levels of nocturnal desaturation and sleep fragmen-\ntation (measured by brain cortical arousal frequency and sleep stages) and degree of as-\nsociated symptoms and daytime impairment. However, the exact number and thresholds\nmay vary according to the specific measurement techniques used, and these numbers may\nchange over time. Regardless of the apnea hypopnea index (count) per se, the disorder is\nconsidered to be more severe when apneas and hypopneas are accompanied by significant\noxygen hemoglobin desaturation (e.g., when more than 10% of the sleep time is spent at\ndesaturation levels of less than 90%) or when sleep is severely fragmented as shown by an\nObstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea\n379\nelevated arousal index (arousal index greater than 30) or reduced stages in deep sleep (e.g.,\npercentage stage N3 [slow-wave sleep] less than 5%).\nDiagnostic Features\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is the most common breathing-related sleep disorder.\nIt is characterized by repeated episodes of upper (pharyngeal) airway obstruction (apneas\nand hypopneas) during sleep. Apnea refers to the total absence of airflow, and hypopnea re-\nfers to a reduction in airflow. Each apnea or hypopnea represents a reduction in breathing\nof at least 10 seconds in duration in adults or two missed breaths in children and is typi-\ncally associated with drops in oxygen saturation of 3% or greater and/or an electroenceph-\nalographic arousal. Both sleep-related (nocturnal) and wake-time symptoms are common.\nThe cardinal symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea are snoring and daytime\nsleepiness. \nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea in adults is diagnosed on the basis of polysom-\nnographic findings and symptoms. The diagnosis is based on symptoms of 1) nocturnal\nbreathing disturbances (i.e., snoring, snorting/gasping, breathing pauses during sleep), or\n2) daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or unrefreshing sleep despite sufficient opportunities to\nsleep that are not better explained by another mental disorder and not attributable to an-\nother medical condition, along with 3) evidence by polysomnography of five or more ob-\nstructive apneas or hypopneas per hour of sleep (Criterion A1). Diagnosis can be made in\nthe absence of these symptoms if there is evidence by polysomnography of 15 or more ob-\nstructive apneas and/or hypopneas per hour of sleep (Criterion A2). \nSpecific attention to disturbed sleep occurring in association with snoring or breathing\npauses and physical findings that increase risk of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea (e.g.,\ncentral obesity, crowded pharyngeal airway, elevated blood pressure) is needed to reduce\nthe chance of misdiagnosing this treatable condition.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nBecause of the frequency of nocturnal awakenings that occur with obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea, individuals may report symptoms of insomnia. Other common, though non-\nspecific, symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea are heartburn, nocturia, morning\nheadaches, dry mouth, erectile dysfunction, and reduced libido. Rarely, individuals may\ncomplain of difficulty breathing while lying supine or sleeping. Hypertension may occur\nin more than 60% of individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea.\nPrevalence\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is a very common disorder, affecting at least 1%–2% of\nchildren, 2%–15% of middle-age adults, and more than 20% of older individuals. In the\ngeneral community, prevalence rates of undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea\nmay be very high in elderly individuals. Since the disorder is strongly associated with obe-\nsity, increases in obesity rates are likely to be accompanied by an increased prevalence of\nthis disorder. Prevalence may be particularly high among males, older adults, and certain\nracial/ethnic groups. In adults, the male-to-female ratio of obstructive sleep apnea hypop-\nnea ranges from 2:1 to 4:1. Gender differences decline in older age, possibly because of an\nincreased prevalence in females after menopause. There is no gender difference among\nprepubertal children.\nDevelopment and Course\nThe age distribution of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea likely follows a J-shaped distri-\nbution. There is a peak in children ages 3–8 years when the nasopharynx may be compro-\nmised by a relatively large mass of tonsillar tissue compared with the size of the upper\n380\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nairway. With growth of the airway and regression of lymphoid tissue during later child-\nhood, there is reduction in prevalence. Then, as obesity prevalence increases in midlife and\nfemales enter menopause, obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea again increases. The course\nin older age is unclear; the disorder may level off after age 65 years, but in other individ-\nuals, prevalence may increase with aging. Because there is some age dependency of the oc-\ncurrence of apneas and hypopneas, polysomnographic results must be interpreted in light\nof other clinical data. In particular, significant clinical symptoms of insomnia or hyper-\nsomnia should be investigated regardless of the individual’s age.\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea usually has an insidious onset, gradual progression,\nand persistent course. Typically the loud snoring has been present for many years, often since\nchildhood, but an increase in its severity may lead the individual to seek evaluation. Weight\ngain may precipitate an increase in symptoms. Although obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea\ncan occur at any age, it most commonly manifests among individuals ages 40–60 years. Over\n4–5 years, the average apnea hypopnea index increases in adults and older individuals by ap-\nproximately two apneas/hypopneas per hour. The apnea hypopnea index is increased and in-\ncident obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is greater among individuals who are older, who are\nmale, or who have a higher baseline body mass index (BMI) or increase their BMI over time.\nSpontaneous resolution of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea has been reported with weight\nloss, particularly after bariatric surgery. In children, seasonal variation in obstructive sleep ap-\nnea hypopnea has been observed, as has improvement with overall growth.\nIn young children, the signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea may be\nmore subtle than in adults, making diagnosis more difficult to establish. Polysomnography is\nuseful in confirming diagnosis. Evidence of fragmentation of sleep on the polysomnogram\nmay not be as apparent as in studies of older individuals, possibly because of the high homeo-\nstatic drive in young individuals. Symptoms such as snoring are usually parent-reported and\nthus have reduced sensitivity. Agitated arousals and unusual sleep postures, such as sleeping\non the hands and knees, may occur. Nocturnal enuresis also may occur and should raise the\nsuspicion of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea if it recurs in a child who was previously dry at\nnight. Children may also manifest excessive daytime sleepiness, although this is not as com-\nmon or pronounced as in adults. Daytime mouth breathing, difficulty in swallowing, and poor\nspeech articulation are also common features in children. Children younger than 5 years more\noften present with nighttime symptoms, such as observed apneas or labored breathing, than\nwith behavioral symptoms (i.e., the nighttime symptoms are more noticeable and more often\nbring the child to clinical attention). In children older than 5 years, daytime symptoms such as\nsleepiness and behavioral problems (e.g., impulsivity and hyperactivity), attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder, learning difficulties, and morning headaches are more often the focus\nof concern. Children with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea also may present with failure to\nthrive and developmental delays. In young children, obesity is a less common risk factor,\nwhile delayed growth and “failure to thrive” may be present.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nGenetic and physiological.\nThe major risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea\nare obesity and male gender. Others include maxillary-mandibular retrognathia or micro-\ngnathia, positive family history of sleep apnea, genetic syndromes that reduce upper\nairway patency (e.g., Down’s syndrome, Treacher Collin’s syndrome), adenotonsillar hy-\npertrophy (especially in young children), menopause (in females), and various endocrine\nsyndromes (e.g., acromegaly). Compared with premenopausal females, males are at in-\ncreased risk for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, possibly reflecting the influences of sex\nhormones on ventilatory control and body fat distribution, as well as because of gender\ndifferences in airway structure. Medications for mental disorders and medical conditions\nthat tend to induce somnolence may worsen the course of apnea symptoms if these med-\nications are not managed carefully.\nObstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea\n381\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea has a strong genetic basis, as evidenced by the sig-\nnificant familial aggregation of the apnea hypopnea index. The prevalence of obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea is approximately twice as high among the first-degree relatives of\nprobands with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea as compared with members of control\nfamilies. One-third of the variance in the apnea hypopnea index is explained by shared fa-\nmilial factors. Although genetic markers with diagnostic or prognostic value are not yet\navailable for use, eliciting a family history of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea should in-\ncrease the clinical suspicion for the disorder.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nThere is a potential for sleepiness and fatigue to be reported differently across cultures. In\nsome groups, snoring may be considered a sign of health and thus may not trigger con-\ncerns. Individuals of Asian ancestry may be at increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea despite relatively low BMI, possibly reflecting the influence of craniofacial risk\nfactors that narrow the nasopharynx.\nGender-Related Issues \nFemales may more commonly report fatigue rather than sleepiness and may underreport\nsnoring. \nDiagnostic Markers\nPolysomnography provides quantitative data on frequency of sleep-related respiratory\ndisturbances and associated changes in oxygen saturation and sleep continuity. Polysom-\nnographic findings in children differ from those in adults in that children demonstrate\nlabored breathing, partial obstructive hypoventilation with cyclical desaturations, hyper-\ncapnia and paradoxical movements. Apnea hypopnea index levels as low as 2 are used to\ndefine thresholds of abnormality in children.\nArterial blood gas measurements while the individual is awake are usually normal, but\nsome individuals can have waking hypoxemia or hypercapnia. This pattern should alert the\nclinician to the possibility of coexisting lung disease or hypoventilation. Imaging procedures\nmay reveal narrowing of the upper airway. Cardiac testing may show evidence of impaired\nventricular function. Individuals with severe nocturnal oxygen desaturation may also have el-\nevated hemoglobin or hematocrit values. Validated sleep measures (e.g., multiple sleep la-\ntency test [MSLT], maintenance of wakefulness test) may identify sleepiness.\nFunctional Consequences of \nObstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea\nMore than 50% of individuals with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea\nreport symptoms of daytime sleepiness. A twofold increased risk of occupational accidents\nhas been reported in association with symptoms of snoring and sleepiness. Motor vehicle\ncrashes also have been reported to be as much as sevenfold higher among individuals with\nelevated apnea hypopnea index values. Clinicians should be cognizant of state govern-\nment requirements for reporting this disorder, especially in relationship to commercial\ndrivers. Reduced scores on measures of health-related quality of life are common in individ-\nuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, with the largest decrements observed in the\nphysical and vitality subscales.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nPrimary snoring and other sleep disorders.\nIndividuals with obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea must be differentiated from individuals with primary snoring (i.e., otherwise\n382\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nasymptomatic individuals who snore and do not have abnormalities on overnight polysom-\nnography). Individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea may additionally report\nnocturnal gasping and choking. The presence of sleepiness or other daytime symptoms\nnot explained by other etiologies suggests the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea hypop-\nnea, but this differentiation requires polysomnography. Definitive differential diagnosis\nbetween hypersomnia, central sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoventilation, and obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea also requires polysomnographic studies.\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea must be differentiated from other causes of sleepi-\nness, such as narcolepsy, hypersomnia, and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea can be differentiated from narcolepsy by the absence of cataplexy,\nsleep-related hallucinations, and sleep paralysis and by the presence of loud snoring,\ngasping during sleep, or observed apneas in sleep. Daytime sleep episodes in narcolepsy\nare characteristically shorter, more refreshing, and more often associated with dreaming.\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea shows characteristic apneas and hypopneas and oxy-\ngen desaturation during nocturnal polysomnographic studies. Narcolepsy results in mul-\ntiple sleep-onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods during the MSLT. Narcolepsy, like\nobstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, may be associated with obesity, and some individuals\nhave concurrent narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. A diagnosis of narco-\nlepsy does not exclude the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, as the two con-\nditions may co-occur.\nInsomnia disorder.\nFor individuals complaining of difficulty initiating or maintaining\nsleep or early-morning awakenings, insomnia disorder can be differentiated from obstruc-\ntive sleep apnea hypopnea by the absence of snoring and the absence of the history, signs,\nand symptoms characteristic of the latter disorder. However, insomnia and obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea may coexist, and if so, both disorders may need to be addressed\nconcurrently to improve sleep.\nPanic attacks.\nNocturnal panic attacks may include symptoms of gasping or choking\nduring sleep that may be difficult to distinguish clinically from obstructive sleep apnea hy-\npopnea. However, the lower frequency of episodes, intense autonomic arousal, and lack of\nexcessive sleepiness differentiate nocturnal panic attacks from obstructive sleep apnea hy-\npopnea. Polysomnography in individuals with nocturnal panic attacks does not reveal the\ntypical pattern of apneas or oxygen desaturation characteristic of obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea. Individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea do not provide a history of\ndaytime panic attacks. \nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in chil-\ndren may include symptoms of inattention, academic impairment, hyperactivity, and in-\nternalizing behaviors, all of which may also be symptoms of childhood obstructive sleep\napnea hypopnea. The presence of other symptoms and signs of childhood obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea (e.g., labored breathing or snoring during sleep and adenotonsillar\nhypertrophy) would suggest the presence of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Obstruc-\ntive sleep apnea hypopnea and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may commonly\nco-occur, and there may be causal links between them; therefore, risk factors such as en-\nlarged tonsils, obesity, or a family history of sleep apnea may help alert the clinician to\ntheir co-occurrence.\nSubstance/medication-induced insomnia or hypersomnia.\nSubstance use and substance\nwithdrawal (including medications) can produce insomnia or hypersomnia. A careful his-\ntory is usually sufficient to identify the relevant substance/medication, and follow-up\nshows improvement of the sleep disturbance after discontinuation of the substance/med-\nication. In other cases, the use of a substance/medication (e.g., alcohol, barbiturates, ben-\nzodiazepines, tobacco) has been shown to exacerbate obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea.\nAn individual with symptoms and signs consistent with obstructive sleep apnea hypop-\nCentral Sleep Apnea\n383\nnea should receive that diagnosis, even in the presence of concurrent substance use that is\nexacerbating the condition.\nComorbidity\nSystemic hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, diabetes, and increased\nmortality are consistently associated with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Risk esti-\nmates vary from 30% to as much as 300% for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea. Evidence of pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure (e.g., cor pulmo-\nnale, ankle edema, hepatic congestion) are rare in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and\nwhen present indicate either very severe disease or associated hypoventilation or cardio-\npulmonary comorbidities. Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea also may occur with in-\ncreased frequency in association with a number of medical or neurological conditions (e.g.,\ncerebrovascular disease, Parkinson’s disease). Physical findings reflect the co-occurrence of\nthese conditions.\nAs many as one-third of individuals referred for evaluation of obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea report symptoms of depression, with as many of 10% having depression scores\nconsistent with moderate to severe depression. Severity of obstructive sleep apnea hypop-\nnea, as measured by the apnea hypopnea index, has been found to be correlated with se-\nverity of symptoms of depression. This association may be stronger in males than in\nfemales.\nRelationship to International Classification of \nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), differentiates 11 sub-\ntypes of “sleep-related breathing disorders,” including primary central sleep apnea, ob-\nstructive sleep apnea, and sleep-related hypoventilation.", "provenance": {"source_file": "sleep_wake_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 4, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.544327"}}

When an opioid use disorder is not present (e.g., after a one-\ntime heavy use of the substance), code only 780.57 (G47.37) central sleep apnea comor-\nbid with opioid use.\n384\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nNote: See the section “Diagnostic Features” in text.\nSpecify current severity:\nSeverity of central sleep apnea is graded according to the frequency of the breathing\ndisturbances as well as the extent of associated oxygen desaturation and sleep frag-\nmentation that occur as a consequence of repetitive respiratory disturbances.\nSubtypes\nIdiopathic central sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes breathing are characterized by increased\ngain of the ventilatory control system, also referred to as high loop gain, which leads to in-\nstability in ventilation and PaCO2 levels. This instability is termed periodic breathing and\ncan be recognized by hyperventilation alternating with hypoventilation. Individuals with\nthese disorders typically have pCO2 levels while awake that are slightly hypocapneic or\nnormocapneic. Central sleep apnea may also manifest during initiation of treatment of ob-\nstructive sleep apnea hypopnea or may occur in association with obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea syndrome (termed complex sleep apnea). The occurrence of central sleep apnea in\nassociation with obstructive sleep apnea is also considered to be due to high loop gain. In\ncontrast, the pathogenesis of central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use has been at-\ntributed to the effects of opioids on the respiratory rhythm generators in the medulla as\nwell as to its differential effects on hypoxic versus hypercapneic respiratory drive. These\nindividuals may have elevated pCO2 levels while awake. Individuals receiving chronic\nmethadone maintenance therapy have been noted to have increased somnolence and de-\npression, although the role of breathing disorders associated with opioid medication in caus-\ning these problems has not been studied. \nSpecifiers\nAn increase in the central apnea index (i.e., number of central apneas per hour of sleep) re-\nflects an increase in severity of central sleep apnea. Sleep continuity and quality may be\nmarkedly impaired with reductions in restorative stages of non–rapid eye movement (REM)\nsleep (i.e., decreased slow-wave sleep [stage N3]). In individuals with severe Cheyne-\nStokes breathing, the pattern can also be observed during resting wakefulness, a finding\nthat is thought to be a poor prognostic marker for mortality. \nDiagnostic Features\nCentral sleep apnea disorders are characterized by repeated episodes of apneas and hy-\npopneas during sleep caused by variability in respiratory effort. These are disorders of\nventilatory control in which respiratory events occur in a periodic or intermittent pattern.\nIdiopathic central sleep apnea is characterized by sleepiness, insomnia, and awakenings due\nto dyspnea in association with five or more central apneas per hour of sleep. Central sleep\napnea occurring in individuals with heart failure, stroke, or renal failure typically have a\nbreathing pattern called Cheyne-Stokes breathing, which is characterized by a pattern of\nperiodic crescendo-decrescendo variation in tidal volume that results in central apneas\nand hypopneas occurring at a frequency of at least five events per hour that are accompa-\nnied by frequent arousals. Central and obstructive sleep apneas may coexist; the ratio of\ncentral to obstructive apneas/hypopneas may be used to identify which condition is pre-\ndominant.\nAlterations in neuromuscular control of breathing can occur in association with med-\nications or substances used in individuals with mental health conditions, which can cause\nor exacerbate impairments of respiratory rhythm and ventilation. Individuals taking these\nmedications have a sleep-related breathing disorder that could contribute to sleep distur-\nbances and symptoms such as sleepiness, confusion, and depression. Specifically, chronic\nCentral Sleep Apnea\n385\nuse of long-acting opioid medications is often associated with impairment of respiratory con-\ntrol leading to central sleep apnea.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with central sleep apnea hypopneas can manifest with sleepiness or insomnia.\nThere can be complaints of sleep fragmentation, including awakening with dyspnea.\nSome individuals are asymptomatic. Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea can coexist with\nCheyne-Stokes breathing, and thus snoring and abruptly terminating apneas may be ob-\nserved during sleep. \nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of idiopathic central sleep apnea is unknown but thought to be rare. The\nprevalence of Cheyne-Stokes breathing is high in individuals with depressed cardiac ven-\ntricular ejection fraction. In individuals with an ejection fraction of less than 45%, the prev-\nalence has been reported to be 20% or higher. The male-to-female ratio for prevalence is\neven more highly skewed toward males than for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Prev-\nalence increases with age, and most patients are older than 60 years. Cheyne-Stokes breath-\ning occurs in approximately 20% of individuals with acute stroke. Central sleep apnea\ncomorbid with opioid use occurs in approximately 30% of individuals taking chronic opi-\noids for nonmalignant pain and similarly in individuals receiving methadone mainte-\nnance therapy. \nDevelopment and Course\nThe onset of Cheyne-Stokes breathing appears tied to the development of heart failure. The\nCheyne-Stokes breathing pattern is associated with oscillations in heart rate, blood pres-\nsure and oxygen desaturation, and elevated sympathetic nervous system activity that can\npromote progression of heart failure. The clinical significance of Cheyne-Stokes breathing\nin the setting of stroke is not known, but Cheyne-Stokes breathing may be a transient find-\ning that resolves with time after acute stroke. Central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid\nuse has been documented with chronic use (i.e., several months). \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nGenetic and physiological.\nCheyne-Stokes breathing is frequently present in individu-\nals with heart failure. The coexistence of atrial fibrillation further increases risk, as do older\nage and male gender. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is also seen in association with acute stroke\nand possibly renal failure. The underlying ventilatory instability in the setting of heart fail-\nure has been attributed to increased ventilatory chemosensitivity and hyperventilation\ndue to pulmonary vascular congestion and circulatory delay. Central sleep apnea is seen\nin individuals taking long-acting opioids.\nDiagnostic Markers\nPhysical findings seen in individuals with a Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern relate to its\nrisk factors. Findings consistent with heart failure, such as jugular venous distension, S3\nheart sound, lung crackles, and lower extremity edema, may be present. Polysomnogra-\nphy is used to characterize the breathing characteristics of each breathing-related sleep\ndisorder subtype. Central sleep apneas are recorded when periods of breathing cessation\nfor longer than 10 seconds occur. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is characterized by a pattern of\nperiodic crescendo-decrescendo variation in tidal volume that results in central apneas\nand hypopneas occurring at a frequency of at least five events per hour that are accompa-\nnied by frequent arousals. The cycle length of Cheyne-Stokes breathing (or time from end\nof one central apnea to the end of the next apnea) is about 60 seconds.\n386\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nFunctional Consequences of Central Sleep Apnea\nIdiopathic central sleep apnea has been reported to cause symptoms of disrupted sleep, in-\ncluding insomnia and sleepiness. Cheyne-Stokes breathing with comorbid heart failure\nhas been associated with excessive sleepiness, fatigue, and insomnia, although many in-\ndividuals may be asymptomatic. Coexistence of heart failure and Cheyne-Stokes breath-\ning may be associated with increased cardiac arrhythmias and increased mortality or\ncardiac transplantation. Individuals with central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use\nmay present with symptoms of sleepiness or insomnia.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nIdiopathic central sleep apnea must be distinguished from other breathing-related sleep\ndisorders, other sleep disorders, and medical conditions and mental disorders that cause\nsleep fragmentation, sleepiness, and fatigue. This is achieved using polysomnography.\nOther breathing-related sleep disorders and sleep disorders.\nCentral sleep apnea can\nbe distinguished from obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea by the presence of at least five\ncentral apneas per hour of sleep. These conditions may co-occur, but central sleep apnea is\nconsidered to predominate when the ratio of central to obstructive respiratory events ex-\nceeds 50%.\nCheyne-Stokes breathing can be distinguished from other mental disorders, including\nother sleep disorders, and other medical conditions that cause sleep fragmentation, sleep-\niness, and fatigue based on the presence of a predisposing condition (e.g., heart failure or\nstroke) and signs and polysomnographic evidence of the characteristic breathing pattern.\nPolysomnographic respiratory findings can help distinguish Cheyne-Stokes breathing\nfrom insomnia due to other medical conditions. High-altitude periodic breathing has a\npattern that resembles Cheyne-Stokes breathing but has a shorter cycle time, occurs only\nat high altitude, and is not associated with heart failure. \nCentral sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use can be differentiated from other types of\nbreathing-related sleep disorders based on the use of long-acting opioid medications in\nconjunction with polysomnographic evidence of central apneas and periodic or ataxic\nbreathing. It can be distinguished from insomnia due to drug or substance use based on\npolysomnographic evidence of central sleep apnea.\nComorbidity\nCentral sleep apnea disorders are frequently present in users of long-acting opioids, such\nas methadone. Individuals taking these medications have a sleep-related breathing disor-\nder that could contribute to sleep disturbances and symptoms such as sleepiness, confu-\nsion, and depression. While the individual is asleep, breathing patterns such as central\napneas, periodic apneas, and ataxic breathing may be observed. Obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea may coexist with central sleep apnea, and features consistent with this condi-\ntion can also be present (see “Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea” earlier in this chapter).\nCheyne-Stokes breathing is more commonly observed in association with conditions that\ninclude heart failure, stroke, and renal failure and is seen more frequently in individuals\nwith atrial fibrillation. Individuals with Cheyne-Stokes breathing are more likely to be\nolder, to be male, and to have lower weight than individuals with obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea.\nSleep-Related Hypoventilation\n387", "provenance": {"source_file": "sleep_wake_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 5, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.544327"}}

Polysomnograpy demonstrates episodes of decreased respiration associated with el- evated CO2 levels. (Note: In the absence of objective measurement of CO2, persistent low levels of hemoglobin oxygen saturation unassociated with apneic/hypopneic events may indicate hypoventilation.) B. The disturbance is not better explained by another current sleep disorder. Specify whether: 327.24 (G47.34) Idiopathic hypoventilation: This subtype is not attributable to any readily identified condition. 327.25 (G47.35) Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation: This subtype is a rare congenital disorder in which the individual typically presents in the perinatal period with shallow breathing, or cyanosis and apnea during sleep. 327.26 (G47.36) Comorbid sleep-related hypoventilation: This subtype occurs as a consequence of a medical condition, such as a pulmonary disorder (e.g., interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or a neuromuscular or chest wall disorder (e.g., muscular dystrophies, postpolio syndrome, cervical spinal cord injury, kyphoscoliosis), or medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, opiates). It also occurs with obesity (obesity hypoventilation disorder), where it reflects a combination of increased work of breathing due to reduced chest wall compliance and ventilation-perfusion mis- match and variably reduced ventilatory drive. Such individuals usually are character- ized by body mass index of greater than 30 and hypercapnia during wakefulness (with a pCO2 of greater than 45), without other evidence of hypoventilation.  Specify current severity: Severity is graded according to the degree of hypoxemia and hypercarbia present dur- ing sleep and evidence of end organ impairment due to these abnormalities (e.g., right- sided heart failure). The presence of blood gas abnormalities during wakefulness is an indicator of greater severity. Subtypes Regarding obesity hypoventilation disorder, the prevalence of obesity hypoventilation in the general population is not known but is thought to be increasing in association with the increased prevalence of obesity and extreme obesity. Diagnostic Features Sleep-related hypoventilation can occur independently or, more frequently, comorbid with medical or neurological disorders, medication use, or substance use disorder. Al- though symptoms are not mandatory to make this diagnosis, individuals often report excessive daytime sleepiness, frequent arousals and awakenings during sleep, morning headaches, and insomnia complaints. Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with sleep-related hypoventilation can present with sleep-related complaints of insomnia or sleepiness. Episodes of orthopnea can occur in individuals with diaphragm weakness. Headaches upon awakening may be present. During sleep, episodes of shallow breathing may be observed, and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea or central sleep apnea may coexist. Consequences of ventilatory insufficiency, including pulmonary hyperten- sion, cor pulmonale (right heart failure), polycythemia, and neurocognitive dysfunction, 388 Sleep-Wake Disorders can be present. With progression of ventilatory insufficiency, blood gas abnormalities ex- tend into wakefulness. Features of the medical condition causing sleep-related hypoven- tilation can also be present. Episodes of hypoventilation may be associated with frequent arousals or bradytachycardia. Individuals may complain of excessive sleepiness and in- somnia or morning headaches or may present with findings of neurocognitive dysfunction or depression. Hypoventilation may not be present during wakefulness. Prevalence Idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation in adults is very uncommon. The prevalence of congenital central alveolar hypoventilation is unknown, but the disorder is rare. Comor- bid sleep-related hypoventilation (i.e., hypoventilation comorbid with other conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], neuromuscular disorders, or obe- sity) is more common. Development and Course Idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation is thought to be a slowly progressive disorder of respiratory impairment. When this disorder occurs comorbidly with other disorders (e.g., COPD, neuromuscular disorders, obesity), disease severity reflects the severity of the un- derlying condition, and the disorder progresses as the condition worsens. Complications such as pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, cardiac dysrhythmias, polycythemia, neurocognitive dysfunction, and worsening respiratory failure can develop with increas- ing severity of blood gas abnormalities. Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation usually manifests at birth with shallow, erratic, or absent breathing. This disorder can also manifest during infancy, childhood, and adulthood because of variable penetrance of the PHOX2B mutation. Children with congenital central alveolar hypoventilation are more likely to have disorders of the auto- nomic nervous system, Hirschsprung’s disease, neural crest tumors, and characteristic box- shaped face (i.e., the face is short relative to its width). Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Ventilatory drive can be reduced in individuals using central nervous system depressants, including benzodiazepines, opiates, and alcohol. Genetic and physiological. Idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation is associated with reduced ventilatory drive due to a blunted chemoresponsiveness to CO2 (reduced respi- ratory drive; i.e., “won’t breathe”), reflecting underlying neurological deficits in centers governing the control of ventilation. More commonly, sleep-related hypoventilation is co- morbid with another medical condition, such as a pulmonary disorder, a neuromuscular or chest wall disorder, or hypothyroidism, or with use of medications (e.g., benzodiaze- pines, opiates). In these conditions, the hypoventilation may be a consequence of in- creased work of breathing and/or impairment of respiratory muscle function (i.e., “can’t breathe”) or reduced respiratory drive (i.e., “won’t breathe”). Neuromuscular disorders influence breathing through impairment of respiratory mo- tor innervation or respiratory muscle function. They include conditions such as amyo- trophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord injury, diaphragmatic paralysis, myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, toxic or metabolic myopathies, postpolio syndrome, and Char- cot-Marie-Tooth syndrome. Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation is a genetic disorder attributable to muta- tions of PHOX2B, a gene that is crucial for the development of the embryonic autonomic nervous system and neural crest derivatives. Children with congenital central alveolar hy- poventilation show blunted ventilatory responses to hypercapnia, especially in non–rapid eye movement sleep. Sleep-Related Hypoventilation 389 Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Gender distributions for sleep-related hypoventilation occurring in association with co- morbid conditions reflect the gender distributions of the comorbid conditions. For exam- ple, COPD is more frequently present in males and with increasing age. Diagnostic Markers Sleep-related hypoventilation is diagnosed using polysomnography showing sleep-related hypoxemia and hypercapnia that is not better explained by another breathing-related sleep disorder. The documentation of increased arterial pCO2 levels to greater than 55 mmHg during sleep or a 10 mmHg or greater increase in pCO2 levels (to a level that also exceeds 50 mmHg) during sleep in comparison to awake supine values, for 10 minutes or longer, is the gold standard for diagnosis. However, obtaining arterial blood gas determinations dur- ing sleep is impractical, and non-invasive measures of pCO2 have not been adequately val- idated during sleep and are not widely used during polysomnography in adults. Prolonged and sustained decreases in oxygen saturation (oxygen saturation of less than 90% for more than 5 minutes with a nadir of at least 85%, or oxygen saturation of less than 90% for at least 30% of sleep time) in the absence of evidence of upper airway obstruction are often used as an indication of sleep-related hypoventilation; however, this finding is not specific, as there are other potential causes of hypoxemia, such as that due to lung disease. Functional Consequences of Sleep-Related Hypoventilation The consequences of sleep-related hypoventilation are related to the effects of chronic ex- posure to hypercapnia and hypoxemia. These blood gas derangements cause vasocon- striction of the pulmonary vasculature leading to pulmonary hypertension, which, if severe, can result in right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale). Hypoxemia can lead to dys- function of organs such as the brain, blood, and heart, leading to outcomes such as cog- nitive dysfunction, polycythemia, and cardiac arrhythmias. Hypercapnia can depress ventilatory drive, leading to progressive respiratory failure. Differential Diagnosis Other medical conditions affecting ventilation. In adults, the idiopathic variety of sleep- related hypoventilation is very uncommon and is determined by excluding the presence of lung diseases, skeletal malformations, neuromuscular disorders, and other medical and neurological disorders or medications that affect ventilation. Sleep-related hypoventila- tion must be distinguished from other causes of sleep-related hypoxemia, such as that due to lung disease. Other breathing-related sleep disorders. Sleep-related hypoventilation can be distin- guished from obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and central sleep apnea based on clinical features and findings on polysomnography. Sleep-related hypoventilation typically shows more sustained periods of oxygen desaturation rather that the periodic episodes seen in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and central sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea hy- popnea and central sleep apnea also show a pattern of discrete episodes of repeated air- flow decreases that can be absent in sleep-related hypoventilation. Comorbidity Sleep-related hypoventilation often occurs in association with a pulmonary disorder (e.g., in- terstitial lung disease, COPD), with a neuromuscular or chest wall disorder (e.g., muscular dystrophies, post-polio syndrome, cervical spinal cord injury, obesity, kyphoscoliosis), or, 390 Sleep-Wake Disorders most relevant to the mental health provider, with medication use (e.g., benzodiazepines, opi- ates). Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation often occurs in association with autonomic dysfunction and may occur in association with Hirschsprung’s disease. COPD, a disorder of lower airway obstruction usually associated with cigarette smoking, can result in sleep- related hypoventilation and hypoxemia. The presence of coexisting obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is thought to exacerbate hypoxemia and hypercapnia during sleep and wakeful- ness. The relationship between congenital central alveolar hypoventilation and idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation is unclear; in some individuals, idiopathic sleep-related hy- poventilation may represent cases of late-onset congenital central alveolar hypoventilation. Relationship to International Classification of Sleep Disorders The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), combines sleep- related hypoventilation and sleep-related hypoxemia under the category of sleep-related hypoventilation/hypoxemic syndromes. This approach to classification reflects the fre- quent co-occurrence of disorders that lead to hypoventilation and hypoxemia. In contrast, the classification used in DSM-5 reflects evidence that there are distinct sleep-related pathogenetic processes leading to hypoventilation.", "provenance": {"source_file": "sleep_wake_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 6, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.544327"}}

Nonetheless, as many as 50% of individuals with sleep apnea may also report\ninsomnia symptoms, a feature that is more common among females and older adults.\nNarcolepsy.\nNarcolepsy may cause insomnia complaints but is distinguished from in-\nsomnia disorder by the predominance of symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, cat-\naplexy, sleep paralysis, and sleep-related hallucinations.\nParasomnias.\nParasomnias are characterized by a complaint of unusual behavior or events\nduring sleep that may lead to intermittent awakenings and difficulty resuming sleep.\nHowever, it is these behavioral events, rather than the insomnia per se, that dominate the\nclinical picture. \n368\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nSubstance/medication-induced sleep disorder, insomnia type.\nSubstance/medication-\ninduced sleep disorder, insomnia type, is distinguished from insomnia disorder by the fact\nthat a substance (i.e., a drug of abuse, a medication, or exposure to a toxin) is judged to be\netiologically related to the insomnia (see “Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disor-\nder” later in this chapter). For example, insomnia occurring only in the context of heavy\ncoffee consumption would be diagnosed as caffeine-induced sleep disorder, insomnia\ntype, with onset during intoxication.\nComorbidity\nInsomnia is a common comorbidity of many medical conditions, including diabetes, cor-\nonary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arthritis, fibromyalgia, and\nother chronic pain conditions. The risk relationship appears to be bidirectional: insomnia\nincreases the risk of medical conditions, and medical problems increase the risk of insom-\nnia. The direction of the relationship is not always clear and may change over time; for this\nreason, comorbid insomnia is the preferred terminology in the presence of coexisting in-\nsomnia with another medical condition (or mental disorder).\nIndividuals with insomnia disorder frequently have a comorbid mental disorder, par-\nticularly bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders. Persistent insomnia represents a risk\nfactor or an early symptom of subsequent bipolar, depressive, anxiety, and substance use\ndisorders. Individuals with insomnia may misuse medications or alcohol to help with\nnighttime sleep, anxiolytics to combat tension or anxiety, and caffeine or other stimulants\nto combat excessive fatigue. In addition to worsening the insomnia, this type of substance\nuse may in some cases progress to a substance use disorder.\nRelationship to International Classification of \nSleep Disorders\nThere are several distinct insomnia phenotypes relating to the perceived source of the in-\nsomnia that are recognized by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition\n(ICSD-2). These include psychophysiological insomnia, idiopathic insomnia, sleep-state mispercep-\ntion, and inadequate sleep hygiene. Despite their clinical appeal and heuristic value, there is\nlimited evidence to support these distinct phenotypes.\nHypersomnolence Disorder\nDiagnostic Criteria\n307.44 (F51.11)\nA. Self-reported excessive sleepiness (hypersomnolence) despite a main sleep period\nlasting at least 7 hours, with at least one of the following symptoms: \n1. Recurrent periods of sleep or lapses into sleep within the same day.\n2. A prolonged main sleep episode of more than 9 hours per day that is nonrestorative\n(i.e., unrefreshing).\n3. Difficulty being fully awake after abrupt awakening.\nB. The hypersomnolence occurs at least three times per week, for at least 3 months.\nC. The hypersomnolence is accompanied by significant distress or impairment in cogni-\ntive, social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. \nD. The hypersomnolence is not better explained by and does not occur exclusively during\nthe course of another sleep disorder (e.g., narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disor-\nder, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, or a parasomnia).\nE. The hypersomnolence is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance\n(e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication).\nHypersomnolence Disorder\n369\nF. Coexisting mental and medical disorders do not adequately explain the predominant\ncomplaint of hypersomnolence.\nSpecify if:\nWith mental disorder, including substance use disorders\nWith medical condition\nWith another sleep disorder\nCoding note: The code 307.44 (F51.11) applies to all three specifiers. Code also the\nrelevant associated mental disorder, medical condition, or other sleep disorder im-\nmediately after the code for hypersomnolence disorder in order to indicate the associ-\nation.\nSpecify if:\nAcute: Duration of less than 1 month.\nSubacute: Duration of 1–3 months.\nPersistent: Duration of more than 3 months.\nSpecify current severity:\nSpecify severity based on degree of difficulty maintaining daytime alertness as manifested\nby the occurrence of multiple attacks of irresistible sleepiness within any given day occur-\nring, for example, while sedentary, driving, visiting with friends, or working. \nMild: Difficulty maintaining daytime alertness 1–2 days/week.\nModerate: Difficulty maintaining daytime alertness 3–4 days/week.\nSevere: Difficulty maintaining daytime alertness 5–7 days/week.\nDiagnostic Features\nHypersomnolence is a broad diagnostic term and includes symptoms of excessive quantity\nof sleep (e.g., extended nocturnal sleep or involuntary daytime sleep), deteriorated quality\nof wakefulness (i.e., sleep propensity during wakefulness as shown by difficulty awaken-\ning or inability to remain awake when required), and sleep inertia (i.e., a period of im-\npaired performance and reduced vigilance following awakening from the regular sleep\nepisode or from a nap) (Criterion A). Individuals with this disorder fall asleep quickly and\nhave a good sleep efficiency (>90%). They may have difficulty waking up in the morning,\nsometimes appearing confused, combative, or ataxic. This prolonged impairment of alert-\nness at the sleep-wake transition is often referred to as sleep inertia (i.e., sleep drunkenness).\nIt can also occur upon awakening from a daytime nap. During that period, the individual\nappears awake, but there is a decline in motor dexterity, behavior may be very inappro-\npriate, and memory deficits, disorientation in time and space, and feelings of grogginess\nmay occur. This period may last some minutes to hours. \nThe persistent need for sleep can lead to automatic behavior (usually of a very routine,\nlow-complexity type) that the individual carries out with little or no subsequent recall. For\nexample, individuals may find themselves having driven several miles from where they\nthought they were, unaware of the “automatic” driving they did in the preceding minutes.\nFor some individuals with hypersomnolence disorder, the major sleep episode (for most\nindividuals, nocturnal sleep) has a duration of 9 hours or more. However, the sleep is often\nnonrestorative and is followed by difficulty awakening in the morning. For other individ-\nuals with hypersomnolence disorder, the major sleep episode is of normal nocturnal sleep\nduration (6–9 hours). In these cases, the excessive sleepiness is characterized by several un-\nintentional daytime naps. These daytime naps tend to be relatively long (often lasting 1 hour\nor more), are experienced as nonrestorative (i.e., unrefreshing), and do not lead to improved\nalertness. Individuals with hypersomnolence have daytime naps nearly everyday regard-\nless of the nocturnal sleep duration. Subjective sleep quality may or may not be reported as\ngood. Individuals typically feel sleepiness developing over a period of time, rather than\n370\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nexperiencing a sudden sleep “attack.” Unintentional sleep episodes typically occur in low-\nstimulation and low-activity situations (e.g., while attending lectures, reading, watching\ntelevision, or driving long distances), but in more severe cases they can manifest in high-\nattention situations such as at work, in meetings, or at social gatherings.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nNonrestorative sleep, automatic behavior, difficulties awakening in the morning, and\nsleep inertia, although common in hypersomnolence disorder, may also be seen in a variety\nof conditions, including narcolepsy. Approximately 80% of individuals with hyper-\nsomnolence report that their sleep is nonrestorative, and as many have difficulties awak-\nening in the morning. Sleep inertia, though less common (i.e., observed in 36%–50% of\nindividuals with hypersomnolence disorder), is highly specific to hypersomnolence. Short\nnaps (i.e., duration of less than 30 minutes) are often unrefreshing. Individuals with hy-\npersomnolence often appear sleepy and may even fall asleep in the clinician’s waiting\narea. \nA subset of individuals with hypersomnolence disorder have a family history of hy-\npersomnolence and also have symptoms of autonomic nervous system dysfunction, in-\ncluding recurrent vascular-type headaches, reactivity of the peripheral vascular system\n(Raynaud’s phenomenon), and fainting.\nPrevalence\nApproximately 5%–10% of individuals who consult in sleep disorders clinics with com-\nplaints of daytime sleepiness are diagnosed as having hypersomnolence disorder. It is es-\ntimated that about 1% of the European and U.S. general population has episodes of sleep\ninertia. Hypersomnolence occurs with relatively equal frequency in males and females.\nDevelopment and Course\nHypersomnolence disorder has a persistent course, with a progressive evolution in the se-\nverity of symptoms. In most extreme cases, sleep episodes can last up to 20 hours. How-\never, the average nighttime sleep duration is around 9½ hours. While many individuals\nwith hypersomnolence are able to reduce their sleep time during working days, weekend\nand holiday sleep is greatly increased (by up to 3 hours). Awakenings are very difficult\nand accompanied by sleep inertia episodes in nearly 40% of cases. Hypersomnolence fully\nmanifests in most cases in late adolescence or early adulthood, with a mean age at onset of\n17–24 years. Individuals with hypersomnolence disorder are diagnosed, on average, 10–15\nyears after the appearance of the first symptoms. Pediatric cases are rare. \nHypersomnolence has a progressive onset, with symptoms beginning between ages 15\nand 25 years, with a gradual progression over weeks to months. For most individuals, the\ncourse is then persistent and stable, unless treatment is initiated. The development of other\nsleep disorders (e.g., breathing-related sleep disorder) may worsen the degree of sleepi-\nness. Although hyperactivity may be one of the presenting signs of daytime sleepiness in\nchildren, voluntary napping increases with age. This normal phenomenon is distinct from\nhypersomnolence.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nEnvironmental.\nHypersomnolence can be increased temporarily by psychological stress\nand alcohol use, but they have not been documented as environmental precipitating\nfactors. Viral infections have been reported to have preceded or accompanied hyper-\nsomnolence in about 10% of cases. Viral infections, such as HIV pneumonia, infectious\nmononucleosis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome, can also evolve into hypersomnolence within\nHypersomnolence Disorder\n371\nmonths after the infection. Hypersomnolence can also appear within 6–18 months follow-\ning a head trauma. \nGenetic and physiological.\nHypersomnolence may be familial, with an autosomal-\ndominant mode of inheritance. \nDiagnostic Markers\nNocturnal polysomnography demonstrates a normal to prolonged sleep duration, short\nsleep latency, and normal to increased sleep continuity. The distribution of rapid eye\nmovement (REM) sleep is also normal. Sleep efficiency is mostly greater than 90%. Some\nindividuals with hypersomnolence disorder have increased amounts of slow-wave sleep.\nThe multiple sleep latency test documents sleep tendency, typically indicated by mean\nsleep latency values of less than 8 minutes. In hypersomnolence disorder, the mean sleep\nlatency is typically less than 10 minutes and frequently 8 minutes or less. Sleep-onset REM\nperiods (SOREMPs; i.e., the occurrence of REM sleep within 20 minutes of sleep onset)\nmay be present but occur less than two times in four to five nap opportunities. \nFunctional Consequences of Hypersomnolence Disorder\nThe low level of alertness that occurs while an individual fights the need for sleep can lead\nto reduced efficiency, diminished concentration, and poor memory during daytime activ-\nities. Hypersomnolence can lead to significant distress and dysfunction in work and social\nrelationships. Prolonged nocturnal sleep and difficulty awakening can result in difficulty\nin meeting morning obligations, such as arriving at work on time. Unintentional daytime\nsleep episodes can be embarrassing and even dangerous, if, for instance, the individual is\ndriving or operating machinery when the episode occurs. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nNormative variation in sleep.\n“Normal” sleep duration varies considerably in the general\npopulation. “Long sleepers” (i.e., individuals who require a greater than average amount\nof sleep) do not have excessive sleepiness, sleep inertia, or automatic behavior when they\nobtain their required amount of nocturnal sleep. Sleep is reported to be refreshing. If social\nor occupational demands lead to shorter nocturnal sleep, daytime symptoms may appear.\nIn hypersomnolence disorder, by contrast, symptoms of excessive sleepiness occur regard-\nless of nocturnal sleep duration. An inadequate amount of nocturnal sleep, or behaviorally\ninduced insufficient sleep syndrome, can produce symptoms of daytime sleepiness very similar\nto those of hypersomnolence. An average sleep duration of fewer than 7 hours per night\nstrongly suggests inadequate nocturnal sleep, and an average of more than 9–10 hours of\nsleep per 24-hour period suggests hypersomnolence. Individuals with inadequate noctur-\nnal sleep typically “catch up” with longer sleep durations on days when they are free from\nsocial or occupational demands or on vacations. Unlike hypersomnolence, insufficient\nnocturnal sleep is unlikely to persist unabated for decades. A diagnosis of hypersomno-\nlence disorder should not be made if there is a question regarding the adequacy of noctur-\nnal sleep duration. A diagnostic and therapeutic trial of sleep extension for 10–14 days can\noften clarify the diagnosis.\nPoor sleep quality and fatigue.\nHypersomnolence disorder should be distinguished\nfrom excessive sleepiness related to insufficient sleep quantity or quality and fatigue (i.e.,\ntiredness not necessarily relieved by increased sleep and unrelated to sleep quantity or\nquality). Excessive sleepiness and fatigue are difficult to differentiate and may overlap\nconsiderably. \nBreathing-related sleep disorders.\nIndividuals with hypersomnolence and breathing-\nrelated sleep disorders may have similar patterns of excessive sleepiness. Breathing-\n372\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nrelated sleep disorders are suggested by a history of loud snoring, pauses in breathing\nduring sleep, brain injury, or cardiovascular disease and by the presence of obesity, oro-\npharyngeal anatomical abnormalities, hypertension, or heart failure on physical examina-\ntion. Polysomnographic studies can confirm the presence of apneic events in breathing-\nrelated sleep disorder (and their absence in hypersomnolence disorder).\nCircadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders.\nCircadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders are\noften characterized by daytime sleepiness. A history of an abnormal sleep-wake schedule\n(with shifted or irregular hours) is present in individuals with a circadian rhythm sleep-\nwake disorder. \nParasomnias.\nParasomnias rarely produce the prolonged, undisturbed nocturnal sleep\nor daytime sleepiness characteristic of hypersomnolence disorder.\nOther mental disorders.\nHypersomnolence disorder must be distinguished from mental\ndisorders that include hypersomnolence as an essential or associated feature. In particular,\ncomplaints of daytime sleepiness may occur in a major depressive episode, with atypical fea-\ntures, and in the depressed phase of bipolar disorder. Assessment for other mental disorders is\nessential before a diagnosis of hypersomnolence disorder is considered. A diagnosis of hyper-\nsomnolence disorder can be made in the presence of another current or past mental disorder. \nComorbidity\nHypersomnolence can be associated with depressive disorders, bipolar disorders (during a\ndepressive episode), and major depressive disorder, with seasonal pattern. Many individu-\nals with hypersomnolence disorder have symptoms of depression that may meet criteria for\na depressive disorder. This presentation may be related to the psychosocial consequences of\npersistent increased sleep need. Individuals with hypersomnolence disorder are also at\nrisk for substance-related disorders, particularly related to self-medication with stimulants.\nThis general lack of specificity may contribute to very heterogeneous profiles among indi-\nviduals whose symptoms meet the same diagnostic criteria for hypersomnolence disorder.\nNeurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and mul-\ntiple system atrophy, may also be associated with hypersomnolence. \nRelationship to International Classification of \nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), differentiates nine\nsubtypes of “hypersomnias of central origin,” including recurrent hypersomnia (Kleine-\nLevin syndrome).\nNarcolepsy\nDiagnostic Criteria\nA. Recurrent periods of an irrepressible need to sleep, lapsing into sleep, or napping oc-\ncurring within the same day. These must have been occurring at least three times per\nweek over the past 3 months. \nB. The presence of at least one of the following:\n1. Episodes of cataplexy, defined as either (a) or (b), occurring at least a few times\nper month: \na. In individuals with long-standing disease, brief (seconds to minutes) episodes\nof sudden bilateral loss of muscle tone with maintained consciousness that are\nprecipitated by laughter or joking.\nNarcolepsy\n373\nb. In children or in individuals within 6 months of onset, spontaneous grimaces or\njaw-opening episodes with tongue thrusting or a global hypotonia, without any\nobvious emotional triggers.\n2. Hypocretin deficiency, as measured using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1\nimmunoreactivity values (less than or equal to one-third of values obtained in\nhealthy subjects tested using the same assay, or less than or equal to 110 pg/mL).\nLow CSF levels of hypocretin-1 must not be observed in the context of acute brain\ninjury, inflammation, or infection.\n3. Nocturnal sleep polysomnography showing rapid eye movement (REM) sleep la-\ntency less than or equal to 15 minutes, or a multiple sleep latency test showing a\nmean sleep latency less than or equal to 8 minutes and two or more sleep-onset\nREM periods.\nSpecify whether:\n347.00 (G47.419) Narcolepsy without cataplexy but with hypocretin deficiency: Cri-\nterion B requirements of low CSF hypocretin-1 levels and positive polysomnography/\nmultiple sleep latency test are met, but no cataplexy is present (Criterion B1 not met).\n347.01 (G47.411) Narcolepsy with cataplexy but without hypocretin deficiency:\nIn this rare subtype (less than 5% of narcolepsy cases), Criterion B requirements of\ncataplexy and positive polysomnography/multiple sleep latency test are met, but CSF\nhypocretin-1 levels are normal (Criterion B2 not met).\n347.00 (G47.419) Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, deafness, and narco-\nlepsy: This subtype is caused by exon 21 DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase-1 mu-\ntations and is characterized by late-onset (age 30–40 years) narcolepsy (with low or\nintermediate CSF hypocretin-1 levels), deafness, cerebellar ataxia, and eventually de-\nmentia. \n347.00 (G47.419) Autosomal dominant narcolepsy, obesity, and type 2 diabetes:\nNarcolepsy, obesity, and type 2 diabetes and low CSF hypocretin-1 levels have been\ndescribed in rare cases and are associated with a mutation in the myelin oligodendro-\ncyte glycoprotein gene.\n347.10 (G47.429) Narcolepsy secondary to another medical condition: This sub-\ntype is for narcolepsy that develops secondary to medical conditions that cause infec-\ntious (e.g., Whipple’s disease, sarcoidosis), traumatic, or tumoral destruction of\nhypocretin neurons.\nCoding note (for ICD-9-CM code 347.10 only): Code first the underlying medical con-\ndition (e.g., 040.2 Whipple’s disease; 347.10 narcolepsy secondary to Whipple’s dis-\nease).\nSpecify current severity:\nMild: Infrequent cataplexy (less than once per week), need for naps only once or twice\nper day, and less disturbed nocturnal sleep.\nModerate: Cataplexy once daily or every few days, disturbed nocturnal sleep, and\nneed for multiple naps daily.\nSevere: Drug-resistant cataplexy with multiple attacks daily, nearly constant sleepi-\nness, and disturbed nocturnal sleep (i.e., movements, insomnia, and vivid dreaming).\nSubtypes\nIn narcolepsy without cataplexy but with hypocretin deficiency, unclear “cataplexy-like”\nsymptoms may be reported (e.g., the symptoms are not triggered by emotions and are un-\nusually long lasting). In extremely rare cases, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of hypocre-\ntin-1 are low, and polysomnographic/multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) results are\nnegative: repeating the test is advised before establishing the subtype diagnosis. In narco-\n374\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nlepsy with cataplexy but without hypocretin deficiency, test results for human leukocyte\nantigen (HLA) DQB1*06:02 may be negative. Seizures, falls of other origin, and conversion\ndisorder (functional neurological symptom disorder) should be excluded. In narcolepsy\nsecondary to infectious (e.g., Whipple’s disease, sarcoidosis), traumatic, or tumoral de-\nstruction of hypocretin neurons, test results for HLA DQB1*06:02 may be positive and may\nresult from the insult triggering the autoimmune process. In other cases, the destruction of\nhypocretin neurons may be secondary to trauma or hypothalamic surgery. Head trauma\nor infections of the central nervous system can, however, produce transitory decreases in\nCSF hypocretin-1 levels without hypocretin cell loss, complicating the diagnosis.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential features of sleepiness in narcolepsy are recurrent daytime naps or lapses into\nsleep. Sleepiness typically occurs daily but must occur at a minimum three times a week\nfor at least 3 months (Criterion A). Narcolepsy generally produces cataplexy, which most\ncommonly presents as brief episodes (seconds to minutes) of sudden, bilateral loss of mus-\ncle tone precipitated by emotions, typically laughing and joking. Muscles affected may\ninclude those of the neck, jaw, arms, legs, or whole body, resulting in head bobbing, jaw\ndropping, or complete falls. Individuals are awake and aware during cataplexy. To meet\nCriterion B1(a), cataplexy must be triggered by laughter or joking and must occur at least\na few times per month when the condition is untreated or in the past.\nCataplexy should not be confused with “weakness” occurring in the context of athletic\nactivities (physiological) or exclusively after unusual emotional triggers such as stress or\nanxiety (suggesting possible psychopathology). Episodes lasting hours or days, or those not\ntriggered by emotions, are unlikely to be cataplexy, nor is rolling on the floor while laugh-\ning hysterically.\nIn children close to onset, genuine cataplexy can be atypical, affecting primarily the\nface, causing grimaces or jaw opening with tongue thrusting (“cataplectic faces”). Alter-\nnatively, cataplexy may present as low-grade continuous hypotonia, yielding a wobbling\nwalk. In these cases, Criterion B1(b) can be met in children or in individuals within 6 months\nof a rapid onset.\nNarcolepsy-cataplexy nearly always results from the loss of hypothalamic hypocretin\n(orexin)–producing cells, causing hypocretin deficiency (less than or equal to one-third of\ncontrol values, or 110 pg/mL in most laboratories). Cell loss is likely autoimmune, and ap-\nproximately 99% of affected individuals carry HLA-DQB1*06:02 (vs. 12%–38% of control\nsubjects). Thus, checking for the presence of DQB1*06:02 prior to a lumbar puncture for eval-\nuation of CSF hypocretin-1 immunoreactivity may be useful. Rarely, low CSF levels of hypo-\ncretin-1 occur without cataplexy, notably in youths who may develop cataplexy later. CSF\nhypocretin-1 measurement represents the gold standard, excepting associated severe con-\nditions (neurological, inflammatory, infectious, trauma) that can interfere with the assay.\nA nocturnal polysomnographic sleep study followed by an MSLT can also be used to\nconfirm the diagnosis (Criterion B3). These tests must be performed after the individual\nhas stopped all psychotropic medications, following 2 weeks of adequate sleep time (as\ndocumented with sleep diaries, actigraphy). Short rapid eye movement (REM) latency\n(sleep-onset REM period, REM latency less than or equal to 15 minutes) during polysom-\nnography is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis and meets Criterion B3. Alternatively, the\nMSLT result must be positive, showing a mean sleep latency of less than or equal to 8 min-\nutes and two or more sleep-onset REM periods in four to five naps.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis \nWhen sleepiness is severe, automatic behaviors may occur, with the individual continuing\nhis or her activities in a semi-automatic, hazelike fashion without memory or conscious-\nness. Approximately 20%–60% of individuals experience vivid hypnagogic hallucinations\nNarcolepsy\n375\nbefore or upon falling asleep or hypnopompic hallucinations just after awakening. These\nhallucinations are distinct from the less vivid, nonhallucinatory dreamlike mentation at\nsleep onset that occurs in normal sleepers. Nightmares and vivid dreaming are also fre-\nquent in narcolepsy, as is REM sleep behavior disorder. Approximately 20%–60% of indi-\nviduals experience sleep paralysis upon falling asleep or awakening, leaving them awake\nbut unable to move or speak. However, many normal sleepers also report sleep paralysis,\nespecially with stress or sleep deprivation. Nocturnal eating may occur. Obesity is com-\nmon. Nocturnal sleep disruption with frequent long or short awakenings is common and\ncan be disabling.\nIndividuals may appear sleepy or fall asleep in the waiting area or during clinical ex-\namination. During cataplexy, individuals may slump in a chair and have slurred speech or\ndrooping eyelids. If the clinician has time to check reflexes during cataplexy (most attacks\nare less than 10 seconds), reflexes are abolished—an important finding distinguishing gen-\nuine cataplexy from conversion disorder. \nPrevalence\nNarcolepsy-cataplexy affects 0.02%–0.04% of the general population in most countries.\nNarcolepsy affects both genders, with possibly a slight male preponderance. \nDevelopment and Course \nOnset is typically in children and adolescents/young adults but rarely in older adults.\nTwo peaks of onset are suggested, at ages 15–25 years and ages 30–35 years. Onset can be\nabrupt or progressive (over years). Severity is highest when onset is abrupt in children,\nand then decreases with age or with treatment, so that symptoms such as cataplexy can oc-\ncasionally disappear. Abrupt onset in young, prepubescent children can be associated\nwith obesity and premature puberty, a phenotype more frequently observed since 2009. In\nadolescents, onset is more difficult to pinpoint. Onset in adults is often unclear, with some\nindividuals reporting having had excessive sleepiness since birth. Once the disorder has\nmanifested, the course is persistent and lifelong.\nIn 90% of cases, the first symptom to manifest is sleepiness or increased sleep, followed\nby cataplexy (within 1 year in 50% of cases, within 3 years in 85%). Sleepiness, hypnagogic\nhallucinations, vivid dreaming, and REM sleep behavior disorder (excessive movements\nduring REM sleep) are early symptoms. Excessive sleep rapidly progresses to an inability\nto stay awake during the day, and to maintain good sleep at night, without a clear increase\nin total 24-hour sleep needs. In the first months, cataplexy may be atypical, especially in\nchildren. Sleep paralysis usually develops around puberty in children with prepubertal\nonset. Exacerbations of symptoms suggest lack of compliance with medications or devel-\nopment of a concurrent sleep disorder, notably sleep apnea.\nYoung children and adolescents with narcolepsy often develop aggression or behav-\nioral problems secondary to sleepiness and/or nighttime sleep disruption. Workload and\nsocial pressure increase through high school and college, reducing available sleep time at\nnight. Pregnancy does not seem to modify symptoms consistently. After retirement, indi-\nviduals typically have more opportunity for napping, reducing the need for stimulants.\nMaintaining a regular schedule benefits individuals at all ages. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nTemperamental.\nParasomnias, such as sleepwalking, bruxism, REM sleep behavior dis-\norder, and enuresis, may be more common in individuals who develop narcolepsy. Indi-\nviduals commonly report that they need more sleep than other family members. \nEnvironmental.\nGroup A streptococcal throat infection, influenza (notably pandemic\nH1N1 2009), or other winter infections are likely triggers of the autoimmune process, pro-\n376\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nducing narcolepsy a few months later. Head trauma and abrupt changes in sleep-wake\npatterns (e.g., job changes, stress) may be additional triggers. \nGenetic and physiological.\nMonozygotic twins are 25%–32% concordant for narcolepsy.\nThe prevalence of narcolepsy is 1%–2% in first-degree relatives (a 10- to 40-fold increase\noverall). Narcolepsy is strongly associated with DQB1*06:02 (99% vs. 12%–38% in control\nsubjects of various ethnic groups; 25% in the general U.S. population). DQB1*03:01 in-\ncreases, while DQB1*05:01, DQB1*06:01, and DQB1*06:03 reduce risk in the presence of\nDQB1*06:02, but the effect is small. Polymorphisms within the T-cell receptor alpha gene\nand other immune modulating genes also modulate risk slightly.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nNarcolepsy has been described in all ethnic groups and in many cultures. Among African\nAmericans, more cases present without cataplexy or with atypical cataplexy, complicating\ndiagnosis, especially in the presence of obesity and obstructive sleep apnea.\nDiagnostic Markers\nFunctional imaging suggests impaired hypothalamic responses to humorous stimuli.\nNocturnal polysomnography followed by an MSLT is used to confirm the diagnosis of\nnarcolepsy, especially when the disorder is first being diagnosed and before treatment has\nbegun, and if hypocretin deficiency has not been documented biochemically. The poly-\nsomnography/MSLT should be performed after the individual is no longer taking any\npsychotropic drugs and after regular sleep-wake patterns, without shift work or sleep de-\nprivation, have been documented.\nA sleep-onset REM period during the polysomnography (REM sleep latency less than\nor equal to 15 minutes) is highly specific (approximately 1% positive in control subjects)\nbut moderately sensitive (approximately 50%). A positive MSLT result displays an aver-\nage sleep latency of less than or equal to 8 minutes, and sleep-onset REM periods in two or\nmore naps on a four- or five-nap test. The MSLT result is positive in 90%–95% of individ-\nuals with narcolepsy versus 2%–4% of control subjects or individuals with other sleep dis-\norders. Additional polysomnographic findings often include frequent arousals, decreased\nsleep efficiency, and increased stage 1 sleep. Periodic limb movements (found in about\n40% of individuals with narcolepsy) and sleep apnea are often noted.\nHypocretin deficiency is demonstrated by measuring CSF hypocretin-1 immunoreac-\ntivity. The test is particularly useful in individuals with suspected conversion disorder\nand those without typical cataplexy, or in treatment-refractory cases. The diagnostic value\nof the test is not affected by medications, sleep deprivation, or circadian time, but the find-\nings are uninterpretable when the individual is severely ill with a concurrent infection or\nhead trauma or is comatose. CSF cytology, protein, and glucose are within normal range\neven when sampled within weeks of rapid onset. CSF hypocretin-1 in these incipient cases\nis typically already very diminished or undetectable.\nFunctional Consequences of Narcolepsy \nDriving and working are impaired, and individuals with narcolepsy should avoid jobs\nthat place themselves (e.g., working with machinery) or others (e.g., bus driver, pilot) in\ndanger. Once the narcolepsy is controlled with therapy, patients can usually drive, al-\nthough rarely long distances alone. Untreated individuals are also at risk for social isola-\ntion and accidental injury to themselves or others. Social relations may suffer as these\nindividuals strive to avert cataplexy by exerting control over emotions. \nDifferential Diagnosis \nOther hypersomnias.\nHypersomnolence and narcolepsy are similar with respect to the\ndegree of daytime sleepiness, age at onset, and stable course over time but can be distin-\nNarcolepsy\n377\nguished based on distinctive clinical and laboratory features. Individuals with hypersom-\nnolence typically have longer and less disrupted nocturnal sleep, greater difficulty\nawakening, more persistent daytime sleepiness (as opposed to more discrete “sleep at-\ntacks” in narcolepsy), longer and less refreshing daytime sleep episodes, and little or no\ndreaming during daytime naps. By contrast, individuals with narcolepsy have cataplexy\nand recurrent intrusions of elements of REM sleep into the transition between sleep and\nwakefulness (e.g., sleep-related hallucinations and sleep paralysis). The MSLT typically\ndemonstrates shorter sleep latencies (i.e., greater physiological sleepiness) as well as the\npresence of multiple sleep-onset REM periods in individuals with narcolepsy.\nSleep deprivation and insufficient nocturnal sleep.\nSleep deprivation and insufficient\nnocturnal sleep are common in adolescents and shift workers. In adolescents, difficulties\nfalling asleep at night are common, causing sleep deprivation. The MSLT result may be\npositive if conducted while the individual is sleep deprived or while his or her sleep is\nphase delayed. \nSleep apnea syndromes.\nSleep apneas are especially likely in the presence of obesity.\nBecause obstructive sleep apnea is more frequent than narcolepsy, cataplexy may be over-\nlooked (or absent), and the individual is assumed to have obstructive sleep apnea unre-\nsponsive to usual therapies. \nMajor depressive disorder.\nNarcolepsy or hypersomnia may be associated or confused\nwith depression. Cataplexy is not present in depression. The MSLT results are most often\nnormal, and there is dissociation between subjective and objective sleepiness, as measured\nby the mean sleep latency during the MSLT.\nConversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).\nAtypical features,\nsuch as long-lasting cataplexy or unusual triggers, may be present in conversion disorder\n(functional neurological symptom disorder). Individuals may report sleeping and dream-\ning, yet the MSLT does not show the characteristic sleep-onset REM period. Full-blown,\nlong-lasting pseudocataplexy may occur during consultation, allowing the examining\nphysician enough time to verify reflexes, which remain intact. \nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or other behavioral problems.\nIn children and\nadolescents, sleepiness can cause behavioral problems, including aggressiveness and in-\nattention, leading to a misdiagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nSeizures.\nIn young children, cataplexy can be misdiagnosed as seizures. Seizures are not\ncommonly triggered by emotions, and when they are, the trigger is not usually laughing or\njoking. During a seizure, individuals are more likely to hurt themselves when falling. Sei-\nzures characterized by isolated atonia are rarely seen in isolation of other seizures, and\nthey also have signatures on the electroencephalogram. \nChorea and movement disorders.\nIn young children, cataplexy can be misdiagnosed as\nchorea or pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal\ninfections, especially in the context of a strep throat infection and high antistreptolysin O\nantibody levels. Some children may have an overlapping movement disorder close to on-\nset of the cataplexy.\nSchizophrenia.\nIn the presence of florid and vivid hypnagogic hallucinations, individuals\nmay think these experiences are real—a feature that suggests schizophrenia. Similarly,\nwith stimulant treatment, persecutory delusions may develop. If cataplexy is present, the\nclinician should first assume that these symptoms are secondary to narcolepsy before con-\nsidering a co-occurring diagnosis of schizophrenia. \nComorbidity\nNarcolepsy can co-occur with bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders, and in rare cases\nwith schizophrenia. Narcolepsy is also associated with increased body mass index or obe-\n378\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nsity, especially when the narcolepsy is untreated. Rapid weight gain is common in young\nchildren with a sudden disease onset. Comorbid sleep apnea should be considered if there\nis a sudden aggravation of preexisting narcolepsy.\nRelationship to International Classification of \nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), differentiates five\nsubtypes of narcolepsy.\nBreathing-Related Sleep Disorders\nThe breathing-related sleep disorders category encompasses three relatively distinct dis-\norders: obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, central sleep apnea, and sleep-related hypo-\nventilation. \nObstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea\nDiagnostic Criteria\n327.23 (G47.33)\nA. Either (1) or (2): \n1. Evidence by polysomnography of at least five obstructive apneas or hypopneas per\nhour of sleep and either of the following sleep symptoms:\na. Nocturnal breathing disturbances: snoring, snorting/gasping, or breathing\npauses during sleep.\nb. Daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or unrefreshing sleep despite sufficient opportuni-\nties to sleep that is not better explained by another mental disorder (including a\nsleep disorder) and is not attributable to another medical condition.\n2. Evidence by polysomnography of 15 or more obstructive apneas and/or hypopneas\nper hour of sleep regardless of accompanying symptoms.\nSpecify current severity:\nMild: Apnea hypopnea index is less than 15.\nModerate: Apnea hypopnea index is 15–30.\nSevere: Apnea hypopnea index is greater than 30.\nSpecifiers\nDisease severity is measured by a count of the number of apneas plus hypopneas per hour\nof sleep (apnea hypopnea index) using polysomnography or other overnight monitoring.\nOverall severity is also informed by levels of nocturnal desaturation and sleep fragmen-\ntation (measured by brain cortical arousal frequency and sleep stages) and degree of as-\nsociated symptoms and daytime impairment. However, the exact number and thresholds\nmay vary according to the specific measurement techniques used, and these numbers may\nchange over time. Regardless of the apnea hypopnea index (count) per se, the disorder is\nconsidered to be more severe when apneas and hypopneas are accompanied by significant\noxygen hemoglobin desaturation (e.g., when more than 10% of the sleep time is spent at\ndesaturation levels of less than 90%) or when sleep is severely fragmented as shown by an\nObstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea\n379\nelevated arousal index (arousal index greater than 30) or reduced stages in deep sleep (e.g.,\npercentage stage N3 [slow-wave sleep] less than 5%).\nDiagnostic Features\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is the most common breathing-related sleep disorder.\nIt is characterized by repeated episodes of upper (pharyngeal) airway obstruction (apneas\nand hypopneas) during sleep. Apnea refers to the total absence of airflow, and hypopnea re-\nfers to a reduction in airflow. Each apnea or hypopnea represents a reduction in breathing\nof at least 10 seconds in duration in adults or two missed breaths in children and is typi-\ncally associated with drops in oxygen saturation of 3% or greater and/or an electroenceph-\nalographic arousal. Both sleep-related (nocturnal) and wake-time symptoms are common.\nThe cardinal symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea are snoring and daytime\nsleepiness. \nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea in adults is diagnosed on the basis of polysom-\nnographic findings and symptoms. The diagnosis is based on symptoms of 1) nocturnal\nbreathing disturbances (i.e., snoring, snorting/gasping, breathing pauses during sleep), or\n2) daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or unrefreshing sleep despite sufficient opportunities to\nsleep that are not better explained by another mental disorder and not attributable to an-\nother medical condition, along with 3) evidence by polysomnography of five or more ob-\nstructive apneas or hypopneas per hour of sleep (Criterion A1). Diagnosis can be made in\nthe absence of these symptoms if there is evidence by polysomnography of 15 or more ob-\nstructive apneas and/or hypopneas per hour of sleep (Criterion A2). \nSpecific attention to disturbed sleep occurring in association with snoring or breathing\npauses and physical findings that increase risk of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea (e.g.,\ncentral obesity, crowded pharyngeal airway, elevated blood pressure) is needed to reduce\nthe chance of misdiagnosing this treatable condition.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nBecause of the frequency of nocturnal awakenings that occur with obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea, individuals may report symptoms of insomnia. Other common, though non-\nspecific, symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea are heartburn, nocturia, morning\nheadaches, dry mouth, erectile dysfunction, and reduced libido. Rarely, individuals may\ncomplain of difficulty breathing while lying supine or sleeping. Hypertension may occur\nin more than 60% of individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea.\nPrevalence\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is a very common disorder, affecting at least 1%–2% of\nchildren, 2%–15% of middle-age adults, and more than 20% of older individuals. In the\ngeneral community, prevalence rates of undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea\nmay be very high in elderly individuals. Since the disorder is strongly associated with obe-\nsity, increases in obesity rates are likely to be accompanied by an increased prevalence of\nthis disorder. Prevalence may be particularly high among males, older adults, and certain\nracial/ethnic groups. In adults, the male-to-female ratio of obstructive sleep apnea hypop-\nnea ranges from 2:1 to 4:1. Gender differences decline in older age, possibly because of an\nincreased prevalence in females after menopause. There is no gender difference among\nprepubertal children.\nDevelopment and Course\nThe age distribution of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea likely follows a J-shaped distri-\nbution. There is a peak in children ages 3–8 years when the nasopharynx may be compro-\nmised by a relatively large mass of tonsillar tissue compared with the size of the upper\n380\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nairway. With growth of the airway and regression of lymphoid tissue during later child-\nhood, there is reduction in prevalence. Then, as obesity prevalence increases in midlife and\nfemales enter menopause, obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea again increases. The course\nin older age is unclear; the disorder may level off after age 65 years, but in other individ-\nuals, prevalence may increase with aging. Because there is some age dependency of the oc-\ncurrence of apneas and hypopneas, polysomnographic results must be interpreted in light\nof other clinical data. In particular, significant clinical symptoms of insomnia or hyper-\nsomnia should be investigated regardless of the individual’s age.\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea usually has an insidious onset, gradual progression,\nand persistent course. Typically the loud snoring has been present for many years, often since\nchildhood, but an increase in its severity may lead the individual to seek evaluation. Weight\ngain may precipitate an increase in symptoms. Although obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea\ncan occur at any age, it most commonly manifests among individuals ages 40–60 years. Over\n4–5 years, the average apnea hypopnea index increases in adults and older individuals by ap-\nproximately two apneas/hypopneas per hour. The apnea hypopnea index is increased and in-\ncident obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is greater among individuals who are older, who are\nmale, or who have a higher baseline body mass index (BMI) or increase their BMI over time.\nSpontaneous resolution of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea has been reported with weight\nloss, particularly after bariatric surgery. In children, seasonal variation in obstructive sleep ap-\nnea hypopnea has been observed, as has improvement with overall growth.\nIn young children, the signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea may be\nmore subtle than in adults, making diagnosis more difficult to establish. Polysomnography is\nuseful in confirming diagnosis. Evidence of fragmentation of sleep on the polysomnogram\nmay not be as apparent as in studies of older individuals, possibly because of the high homeo-\nstatic drive in young individuals. Symptoms such as snoring are usually parent-reported and\nthus have reduced sensitivity. Agitated arousals and unusual sleep postures, such as sleeping\non the hands and knees, may occur. Nocturnal enuresis also may occur and should raise the\nsuspicion of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea if it recurs in a child who was previously dry at\nnight. Children may also manifest excessive daytime sleepiness, although this is not as com-\nmon or pronounced as in adults. Daytime mouth breathing, difficulty in swallowing, and poor\nspeech articulation are also common features in children. Children younger than 5 years more\noften present with nighttime symptoms, such as observed apneas or labored breathing, than\nwith behavioral symptoms (i.e., the nighttime symptoms are more noticeable and more often\nbring the child to clinical attention). In children older than 5 years, daytime symptoms such as\nsleepiness and behavioral problems (e.g., impulsivity and hyperactivity), attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder, learning difficulties, and morning headaches are more often the focus\nof concern. Children with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea also may present with failure to\nthrive and developmental delays. In young children, obesity is a less common risk factor,\nwhile delayed growth and “failure to thrive” may be present.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nGenetic and physiological.\nThe major risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea\nare obesity and male gender. Others include maxillary-mandibular retrognathia or micro-\ngnathia, positive family history of sleep apnea, genetic syndromes that reduce upper\nairway patency (e.g., Down’s syndrome, Treacher Collin’s syndrome), adenotonsillar hy-\npertrophy (especially in young children), menopause (in females), and various endocrine\nsyndromes (e.g., acromegaly). Compared with premenopausal females, males are at in-\ncreased risk for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, possibly reflecting the influences of sex\nhormones on ventilatory control and body fat distribution, as well as because of gender\ndifferences in airway structure. Medications for mental disorders and medical conditions\nthat tend to induce somnolence may worsen the course of apnea symptoms if these med-\nications are not managed carefully.\nObstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea\n381\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea has a strong genetic basis, as evidenced by the sig-\nnificant familial aggregation of the apnea hypopnea index. The prevalence of obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea is approximately twice as high among the first-degree relatives of\nprobands with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea as compared with members of control\nfamilies. One-third of the variance in the apnea hypopnea index is explained by shared fa-\nmilial factors. Although genetic markers with diagnostic or prognostic value are not yet\navailable for use, eliciting a family history of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea should in-\ncrease the clinical suspicion for the disorder.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nThere is a potential for sleepiness and fatigue to be reported differently across cultures. In\nsome groups, snoring may be considered a sign of health and thus may not trigger con-\ncerns. Individuals of Asian ancestry may be at increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea despite relatively low BMI, possibly reflecting the influence of craniofacial risk\nfactors that narrow the nasopharynx.\nGender-Related Issues \nFemales may more commonly report fatigue rather than sleepiness and may underreport\nsnoring. \nDiagnostic Markers\nPolysomnography provides quantitative data on frequency of sleep-related respiratory\ndisturbances and associated changes in oxygen saturation and sleep continuity. Polysom-\nnographic findings in children differ from those in adults in that children demonstrate\nlabored breathing, partial obstructive hypoventilation with cyclical desaturations, hyper-\ncapnia and paradoxical movements. Apnea hypopnea index levels as low as 2 are used to\ndefine thresholds of abnormality in children.\nArterial blood gas measurements while the individual is awake are usually normal, but\nsome individuals can have waking hypoxemia or hypercapnia. This pattern should alert the\nclinician to the possibility of coexisting lung disease or hypoventilation. Imaging procedures\nmay reveal narrowing of the upper airway. Cardiac testing may show evidence of impaired\nventricular function. Individuals with severe nocturnal oxygen desaturation may also have el-\nevated hemoglobin or hematocrit values. Validated sleep measures (e.g., multiple sleep la-\ntency test [MSLT], maintenance of wakefulness test) may identify sleepiness.\nFunctional Consequences of \nObstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea\nMore than 50% of individuals with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea\nreport symptoms of daytime sleepiness. A twofold increased risk of occupational accidents\nhas been reported in association with symptoms of snoring and sleepiness. Motor vehicle\ncrashes also have been reported to be as much as sevenfold higher among individuals with\nelevated apnea hypopnea index values. Clinicians should be cognizant of state govern-\nment requirements for reporting this disorder, especially in relationship to commercial\ndrivers. Reduced scores on measures of health-related quality of life are common in individ-\nuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, with the largest decrements observed in the\nphysical and vitality subscales.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nPrimary snoring and other sleep disorders.\nIndividuals with obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea must be differentiated from individuals with primary snoring (i.e., otherwise\n382\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nasymptomatic individuals who snore and do not have abnormalities on overnight polysom-\nnography). Individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea may additionally report\nnocturnal gasping and choking. The presence of sleepiness or other daytime symptoms\nnot explained by other etiologies suggests the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea hypop-\nnea, but this differentiation requires polysomnography. Definitive differential diagnosis\nbetween hypersomnia, central sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoventilation, and obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea also requires polysomnographic studies.\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea must be differentiated from other causes of sleepi-\nness, such as narcolepsy, hypersomnia, and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea can be differentiated from narcolepsy by the absence of cataplexy,\nsleep-related hallucinations, and sleep paralysis and by the presence of loud snoring,\ngasping during sleep, or observed apneas in sleep. Daytime sleep episodes in narcolepsy\nare characteristically shorter, more refreshing, and more often associated with dreaming.\nObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea shows characteristic apneas and hypopneas and oxy-\ngen desaturation during nocturnal polysomnographic studies. Narcolepsy results in mul-\ntiple sleep-onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods during the MSLT. Narcolepsy, like\nobstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, may be associated with obesity, and some individuals\nhave concurrent narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. A diagnosis of narco-\nlepsy does not exclude the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, as the two con-\nditions may co-occur.\nInsomnia disorder.\nFor individuals complaining of difficulty initiating or maintaining\nsleep or early-morning awakenings, insomnia disorder can be differentiated from obstruc-\ntive sleep apnea hypopnea by the absence of snoring and the absence of the history, signs,\nand symptoms characteristic of the latter disorder. However, insomnia and obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea may coexist, and if so, both disorders may need to be addressed\nconcurrently to improve sleep.\nPanic attacks.\nNocturnal panic attacks may include symptoms of gasping or choking\nduring sleep that may be difficult to distinguish clinically from obstructive sleep apnea hy-\npopnea. However, the lower frequency of episodes, intense autonomic arousal, and lack of\nexcessive sleepiness differentiate nocturnal panic attacks from obstructive sleep apnea hy-\npopnea. Polysomnography in individuals with nocturnal panic attacks does not reveal the\ntypical pattern of apneas or oxygen desaturation characteristic of obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea. Individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea do not provide a history of\ndaytime panic attacks. \nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in chil-\ndren may include symptoms of inattention, academic impairment, hyperactivity, and in-\nternalizing behaviors, all of which may also be symptoms of childhood obstructive sleep\napnea hypopnea. The presence of other symptoms and signs of childhood obstructive\nsleep apnea hypopnea (e.g., labored breathing or snoring during sleep and adenotonsillar\nhypertrophy) would suggest the presence of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Obstruc-\ntive sleep apnea hypopnea and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may commonly\nco-occur, and there may be causal links between them; therefore, risk factors such as en-\nlarged tonsils, obesity, or a family history of sleep apnea may help alert the clinician to\ntheir co-occurrence.\nSubstance/medication-induced insomnia or hypersomnia.\nSubstance use and substance\nwithdrawal (including medications) can produce insomnia or hypersomnia. A careful his-\ntory is usually sufficient to identify the relevant substance/medication, and follow-up\nshows improvement of the sleep disturbance after discontinuation of the substance/med-\nication. In other cases, the use of a substance/medication (e.g., alcohol, barbiturates, ben-\nzodiazepines, tobacco) has been shown to exacerbate obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea.\nAn individual with symptoms and signs consistent with obstructive sleep apnea hypop-\nCentral Sleep Apnea\n383\nnea should receive that diagnosis, even in the presence of concurrent substance use that is\nexacerbating the condition.\nComorbidity\nSystemic hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, diabetes, and increased\nmortality are consistently associated with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Risk esti-\nmates vary from 30% to as much as 300% for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea. Evidence of pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure (e.g., cor pulmo-\nnale, ankle edema, hepatic congestion) are rare in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and\nwhen present indicate either very severe disease or associated hypoventilation or cardio-\npulmonary comorbidities. Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea also may occur with in-\ncreased frequency in association with a number of medical or neurological conditions (e.g.,\ncerebrovascular disease, Parkinson’s disease). Physical findings reflect the co-occurrence of\nthese conditions.\nAs many as one-third of individuals referred for evaluation of obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea report symptoms of depression, with as many of 10% having depression scores\nconsistent with moderate to severe depression. Severity of obstructive sleep apnea hypop-\nnea, as measured by the apnea hypopnea index, has been found to be correlated with se-\nverity of symptoms of depression. This association may be stronger in males than in\nfemales.\nRelationship to International Classification of \nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), differentiates 11 sub-\ntypes of “sleep-related breathing disorders,” including primary central sleep apnea, ob-\nstructive sleep apnea, and sleep-related hypoventilation.\nCentral Sleep Apnea\nDiagnostic Criteria\nA. Evidence by polysomnography of five or more central apneas per hour of sleep.\nB. The disorder is not better explained by another current sleep disorder.\nSpecify whether:\n327.21 (G47.31) Idiopathic central sleep apnea: Characterized by repeated epi-\nsodes of apneas and hypopneas during sleep caused by variability in respiratory effort\nbut without evidence of airway obstruction.\n786.04 (R06.3) Cheyne-Stokes breathing: A pattern of periodic crescendo-\ndecrescendo variation in tidal volume that results in central apneas and hypopneas at\na frequency of at least five events per hour, accompanied by frequent arousal.\n780.57 (G47.37) Central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use: The pathogenesis\nof this subtype is attributed to the effects of opioids on the respiratory rhythm genera-\ntors in the medulla as well as the differential effects on hypoxic versus hypercapnic re-\nspiratory drive.\nCoding note (for 780.57 [G47.37] code only): When an opioid use disorder is present, first\ncode the opioid use disorder: 305.50 (F11.10) mild opioid use disorder or 304.00 (F11.20)\nmoderate or severe opioid use disorder; then code 780.57 (G47.37) central sleep apnea\ncomorbid with opioid use. When an opioid use disorder is not present (e.g., after a one-\ntime heavy use of the substance), code only 780.57 (G47.37) central sleep apnea comor-\nbid with opioid use.\n384\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nNote: See the section “Diagnostic Features” in text.\nSpecify current severity:\nSeverity of central sleep apnea is graded according to the frequency of the breathing\ndisturbances as well as the extent of associated oxygen desaturation and sleep frag-\nmentation that occur as a consequence of repetitive respiratory disturbances.\nSubtypes\nIdiopathic central sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes breathing are characterized by increased\ngain of the ventilatory control system, also referred to as high loop gain, which leads to in-\nstability in ventilation and PaCO2 levels. This instability is termed periodic breathing and\ncan be recognized by hyperventilation alternating with hypoventilation. Individuals with\nthese disorders typically have pCO2 levels while awake that are slightly hypocapneic or\nnormocapneic. Central sleep apnea may also manifest during initiation of treatment of ob-\nstructive sleep apnea hypopnea or may occur in association with obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea syndrome (termed complex sleep apnea). The occurrence of central sleep apnea in\nassociation with obstructive sleep apnea is also considered to be due to high loop gain. In\ncontrast, the pathogenesis of central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use has been at-\ntributed to the effects of opioids on the respiratory rhythm generators in the medulla as\nwell as to its differential effects on hypoxic versus hypercapneic respiratory drive. These\nindividuals may have elevated pCO2 levels while awake. Individuals receiving chronic\nmethadone maintenance therapy have been noted to have increased somnolence and de-\npression, although the role of breathing disorders associated with opioid medication in caus-\ning these problems has not been studied. \nSpecifiers\nAn increase in the central apnea index (i.e., number of central apneas per hour of sleep) re-\nflects an increase in severity of central sleep apnea. Sleep continuity and quality may be\nmarkedly impaired with reductions in restorative stages of non–rapid eye movement (REM)\nsleep (i.e., decreased slow-wave sleep [stage N3]). In individuals with severe Cheyne-\nStokes breathing, the pattern can also be observed during resting wakefulness, a finding\nthat is thought to be a poor prognostic marker for mortality. \nDiagnostic Features\nCentral sleep apnea disorders are characterized by repeated episodes of apneas and hy-\npopneas during sleep caused by variability in respiratory effort. These are disorders of\nventilatory control in which respiratory events occur in a periodic or intermittent pattern.\nIdiopathic central sleep apnea is characterized by sleepiness, insomnia, and awakenings due\nto dyspnea in association with five or more central apneas per hour of sleep. Central sleep\napnea occurring in individuals with heart failure, stroke, or renal failure typically have a\nbreathing pattern called Cheyne-Stokes breathing, which is characterized by a pattern of\nperiodic crescendo-decrescendo variation in tidal volume that results in central apneas\nand hypopneas occurring at a frequency of at least five events per hour that are accompa-\nnied by frequent arousals. Central and obstructive sleep apneas may coexist; the ratio of\ncentral to obstructive apneas/hypopneas may be used to identify which condition is pre-\ndominant.\nAlterations in neuromuscular control of breathing can occur in association with med-\nications or substances used in individuals with mental health conditions, which can cause\nor exacerbate impairments of respiratory rhythm and ventilation. Individuals taking these\nmedications have a sleep-related breathing disorder that could contribute to sleep distur-\nbances and symptoms such as sleepiness, confusion, and depression. Specifically, chronic\nCentral Sleep Apnea\n385\nuse of long-acting opioid medications is often associated with impairment of respiratory con-\ntrol leading to central sleep apnea.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with central sleep apnea hypopneas can manifest with sleepiness or insomnia.\nThere can be complaints of sleep fragmentation, including awakening with dyspnea.\nSome individuals are asymptomatic. Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea can coexist with\nCheyne-Stokes breathing, and thus snoring and abruptly terminating apneas may be ob-\nserved during sleep. \nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of idiopathic central sleep apnea is unknown but thought to be rare. The\nprevalence of Cheyne-Stokes breathing is high in individuals with depressed cardiac ven-\ntricular ejection fraction. In individuals with an ejection fraction of less than 45%, the prev-\nalence has been reported to be 20% or higher. The male-to-female ratio for prevalence is\neven more highly skewed toward males than for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Prev-\nalence increases with age, and most patients are older than 60 years. Cheyne-Stokes breath-\ning occurs in approximately 20% of individuals with acute stroke. Central sleep apnea\ncomorbid with opioid use occurs in approximately 30% of individuals taking chronic opi-\noids for nonmalignant pain and similarly in individuals receiving methadone mainte-\nnance therapy. \nDevelopment and Course\nThe onset of Cheyne-Stokes breathing appears tied to the development of heart failure. The\nCheyne-Stokes breathing pattern is associated with oscillations in heart rate, blood pres-\nsure and oxygen desaturation, and elevated sympathetic nervous system activity that can\npromote progression of heart failure. The clinical significance of Cheyne-Stokes breathing\nin the setting of stroke is not known, but Cheyne-Stokes breathing may be a transient find-\ning that resolves with time after acute stroke. Central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid\nuse has been documented with chronic use (i.e., several months). \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nGenetic and physiological.\nCheyne-Stokes breathing is frequently present in individu-\nals with heart failure. The coexistence of atrial fibrillation further increases risk, as do older\nage and male gender. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is also seen in association with acute stroke\nand possibly renal failure. The underlying ventilatory instability in the setting of heart fail-\nure has been attributed to increased ventilatory chemosensitivity and hyperventilation\ndue to pulmonary vascular congestion and circulatory delay. Central sleep apnea is seen\nin individuals taking long-acting opioids.\nDiagnostic Markers\nPhysical findings seen in individuals with a Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern relate to its\nrisk factors. Findings consistent with heart failure, such as jugular venous distension, S3\nheart sound, lung crackles, and lower extremity edema, may be present. Polysomnogra-\nphy is used to characterize the breathing characteristics of each breathing-related sleep\ndisorder subtype. Central sleep apneas are recorded when periods of breathing cessation\nfor longer than 10 seconds occur. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is characterized by a pattern of\nperiodic crescendo-decrescendo variation in tidal volume that results in central apneas\nand hypopneas occurring at a frequency of at least five events per hour that are accompa-\nnied by frequent arousals. The cycle length of Cheyne-Stokes breathing (or time from end\nof one central apnea to the end of the next apnea) is about 60 seconds.\n386\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nFunctional Consequences of Central Sleep Apnea\nIdiopathic central sleep apnea has been reported to cause symptoms of disrupted sleep, in-\ncluding insomnia and sleepiness. Cheyne-Stokes breathing with comorbid heart failure\nhas been associated with excessive sleepiness, fatigue, and insomnia, although many in-\ndividuals may be asymptomatic. Coexistence of heart failure and Cheyne-Stokes breath-\ning may be associated with increased cardiac arrhythmias and increased mortality or\ncardiac transplantation. Individuals with central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use\nmay present with symptoms of sleepiness or insomnia.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nIdiopathic central sleep apnea must be distinguished from other breathing-related sleep\ndisorders, other sleep disorders, and medical conditions and mental disorders that cause\nsleep fragmentation, sleepiness, and fatigue. This is achieved using polysomnography.\nOther breathing-related sleep disorders and sleep disorders.\nCentral sleep apnea can\nbe distinguished from obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea by the presence of at least five\ncentral apneas per hour of sleep. These conditions may co-occur, but central sleep apnea is\nconsidered to predominate when the ratio of central to obstructive respiratory events ex-\nceeds 50%.\nCheyne-Stokes breathing can be distinguished from other mental disorders, including\nother sleep disorders, and other medical conditions that cause sleep fragmentation, sleep-\niness, and fatigue based on the presence of a predisposing condition (e.g., heart failure or\nstroke) and signs and polysomnographic evidence of the characteristic breathing pattern.\nPolysomnographic respiratory findings can help distinguish Cheyne-Stokes breathing\nfrom insomnia due to other medical conditions. High-altitude periodic breathing has a\npattern that resembles Cheyne-Stokes breathing but has a shorter cycle time, occurs only\nat high altitude, and is not associated with heart failure. \nCentral sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use can be differentiated from other types of\nbreathing-related sleep disorders based on the use of long-acting opioid medications in\nconjunction with polysomnographic evidence of central apneas and periodic or ataxic\nbreathing. It can be distinguished from insomnia due to drug or substance use based on\npolysomnographic evidence of central sleep apnea.\nComorbidity\nCentral sleep apnea disorders are frequently present in users of long-acting opioids, such\nas methadone. Individuals taking these medications have a sleep-related breathing disor-\nder that could contribute to sleep disturbances and symptoms such as sleepiness, confu-\nsion, and depression. While the individual is asleep, breathing patterns such as central\napneas, periodic apneas, and ataxic breathing may be observed. Obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea may coexist with central sleep apnea, and features consistent with this condi-\ntion can also be present (see “Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea” earlier in this chapter).\nCheyne-Stokes breathing is more commonly observed in association with conditions that\ninclude heart failure, stroke, and renal failure and is seen more frequently in individuals\nwith atrial fibrillation. Individuals with Cheyne-Stokes breathing are more likely to be\nolder, to be male, and to have lower weight than individuals with obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea.\nSleep-Related Hypoventilation\n387\nSleep-Related Hypoventilation\nDiagnostic Criteria\nA. Polysomnograpy demonstrates episodes of decreased respiration associated with el-\nevated CO2 levels. (Note: In the absence of objective measurement of CO2, persistent\nlow levels of hemoglobin oxygen saturation unassociated with apneic/hypopneic\nevents may indicate hypoventilation.)\nB. The disturbance is not better explained by another current sleep disorder.\nSpecify whether:\n327.24 (G47.34) Idiopathic hypoventilation: This subtype is not attributable to any\nreadily identified condition.\n327.25 (G47.35) Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation: This subtype is a rare\ncongenital disorder in which the individual typically presents in the perinatal period with\nshallow breathing, or cyanosis and apnea during sleep.\n327.26 (G47.36) Comorbid sleep-related hypoventilation: This subtype occurs as a\nconsequence of a medical condition, such as a pulmonary disorder (e.g., interstitial\nlung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or a neuromuscular or chest wall\ndisorder (e.g., muscular dystrophies, postpolio syndrome, cervical spinal cord injury,\nkyphoscoliosis), or medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, opiates). It also occurs with\nobesity (obesity hypoventilation disorder), where it reflects a combination of increased\nwork of breathing due to reduced chest wall compliance and ventilation-perfusion mis-\nmatch and variably reduced ventilatory drive. Such individuals usually are character-\nized by body mass index of greater than 30 and hypercapnia during wakefulness (with\na pCO2 of greater than 45), without other evidence of hypoventilation.  \nSpecify current severity:\nSeverity is graded according to the degree of hypoxemia and hypercarbia present dur-\ning sleep and evidence of end organ impairment due to these abnormalities (e.g., right-\nsided heart failure). The presence of blood gas abnormalities during wakefulness is an\nindicator of greater severity.\nSubtypes\nRegarding obesity hypoventilation disorder, the prevalence of obesity hypoventilation in\nthe general population is not known but is thought to be increasing in association with the\nincreased prevalence of obesity and extreme obesity.\nDiagnostic Features\nSleep-related hypoventilation can occur independently or, more frequently, comorbid\nwith medical or neurological disorders, medication use, or substance use disorder. Al-\nthough symptoms are not mandatory to make this diagnosis, individuals often report\nexcessive daytime sleepiness, frequent arousals and awakenings during sleep, morning\nheadaches, and insomnia complaints. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with sleep-related hypoventilation can present with sleep-related complaints\nof insomnia or sleepiness. Episodes of orthopnea can occur in individuals with diaphragm\nweakness. Headaches upon awakening may be present. During sleep, episodes of shallow\nbreathing may be observed, and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea or central sleep apnea\nmay coexist. Consequences of ventilatory insufficiency, including pulmonary hyperten-\nsion, cor pulmonale (right heart failure), polycythemia, and neurocognitive dysfunction,\n388\nSleep-Wake Disorders\ncan be present. With progression of ventilatory insufficiency, blood gas abnormalities ex-\ntend into wakefulness. Features of the medical condition causing sleep-related hypoven-\ntilation can also be present. Episodes of hypoventilation may be associated with frequent\narousals or bradytachycardia. Individuals may complain of excessive sleepiness and in-\nsomnia or morning headaches or may present with findings of neurocognitive dysfunction\nor depression. Hypoventilation may not be present during wakefulness.\nPrevalence\nIdiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation in adults is very uncommon. The prevalence of\ncongenital central alveolar hypoventilation is unknown, but the disorder is rare. Comor-\nbid sleep-related hypoventilation (i.e., hypoventilation comorbid with other conditions,\nsuch as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], neuromuscular disorders, or obe-\nsity) is more common.\nDevelopment and Course\nIdiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation is thought to be a slowly progressive disorder of\nrespiratory impairment. When this disorder occurs comorbidly with other disorders (e.g.,\nCOPD, neuromuscular disorders, obesity), disease severity reflects the severity of the un-\nderlying condition, and the disorder progresses as the condition worsens. Complications\nsuch as pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, cardiac dysrhythmias, polycythemia,\nneurocognitive dysfunction, and worsening respiratory failure can develop with increas-\ning severity of blood gas abnormalities. \nCongenital central alveolar hypoventilation usually manifests at birth with shallow,\nerratic, or absent breathing. This disorder can also manifest during infancy, childhood,\nand adulthood because of variable penetrance of the PHOX2B mutation. Children with\ncongenital central alveolar hypoventilation are more likely to have disorders of the auto-\nnomic nervous system, Hirschsprung’s disease, neural crest tumors, and characteristic box-\nshaped face (i.e., the face is short relative to its width).\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nEnvironmental.\nVentilatory drive can be reduced in individuals using central nervous\nsystem depressants, including benzodiazepines, opiates, and alcohol. \nGenetic and physiological.\nIdiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation is associated with\nreduced ventilatory drive due to a blunted chemoresponsiveness to CO2 (reduced respi-\nratory drive; i.e., “won’t breathe”), reflecting underlying neurological deficits in centers\ngoverning the control of ventilation. More commonly, sleep-related hypoventilation is co-\nmorbid with another medical condition, such as a pulmonary disorder, a neuromuscular\nor chest wall disorder, or hypothyroidism, or with use of medications (e.g., benzodiaze-\npines, opiates). In these conditions, the hypoventilation may be a consequence of in-\ncreased work of breathing and/or impairment of respiratory muscle function (i.e., “can’t\nbreathe”) or reduced respiratory drive (i.e., “won’t breathe”).\nNeuromuscular disorders influence breathing through impairment of respiratory mo-\ntor innervation or respiratory muscle function. They include conditions such as amyo-\ntrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord injury, diaphragmatic paralysis, myasthenia gravis,\nLambert-Eaton syndrome, toxic or metabolic myopathies, postpolio syndrome, and Char-\ncot-Marie-Tooth syndrome. \nCongenital central alveolar hypoventilation is a genetic disorder attributable to muta-\ntions of PHOX2B, a gene that is crucial for the development of the embryonic autonomic\nnervous system and neural crest derivatives. Children with congenital central alveolar hy-\npoventilation show blunted ventilatory responses to hypercapnia, especially in non–rapid\neye movement sleep.\nSleep-Related Hypoventilation\n389\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nGender distributions for sleep-related hypoventilation occurring in association with co-\nmorbid conditions reflect the gender distributions of the comorbid conditions. For exam-\nple, COPD is more frequently present in males and with increasing age. \nDiagnostic Markers \nSleep-related hypoventilation is diagnosed using polysomnography showing sleep-related\nhypoxemia and hypercapnia that is not better explained by another breathing-related sleep\ndisorder. The documentation of increased arterial pCO2 levels to greater than 55 mmHg\nduring sleep or a 10 mmHg or greater increase in pCO2 levels (to a level that also exceeds\n50 mmHg) during sleep in comparison to awake supine values, for 10 minutes or longer, is\nthe gold standard for diagnosis. However, obtaining arterial blood gas determinations dur-\ning sleep is impractical, and non-invasive measures of pCO2 have not been adequately val-\nidated during sleep and are not widely used during polysomnography in adults. Prolonged\nand sustained decreases in oxygen saturation (oxygen saturation of less than 90% for more\nthan 5 minutes with a nadir of at least 85%, or oxygen saturation of less than 90% for at least\n30% of sleep time) in the absence of evidence of upper airway obstruction are often used as\nan indication of sleep-related hypoventilation; however, this finding is not specific, as there\nare other potential causes of hypoxemia, such as that due to lung disease.\nFunctional Consequences of \nSleep-Related Hypoventilation\nThe consequences of sleep-related hypoventilation are related to the effects of chronic ex-\nposure to hypercapnia and hypoxemia. These blood gas derangements cause vasocon-\nstriction of the pulmonary vasculature leading to pulmonary hypertension, which, if\nsevere, can result in right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale). Hypoxemia can lead to dys-\nfunction of organs such as the brain, blood, and heart, leading to outcomes such as cog-\nnitive dysfunction, polycythemia, and cardiac arrhythmias. Hypercapnia can depress\nventilatory drive, leading to progressive respiratory failure. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther medical conditions affecting ventilation.\nIn adults, the idiopathic variety of sleep-\nrelated hypoventilation is very uncommon and is determined by excluding the presence of\nlung diseases, skeletal malformations, neuromuscular disorders, and other medical and\nneurological disorders or medications that affect ventilation. Sleep-related hypoventila-\ntion must be distinguished from other causes of sleep-related hypoxemia, such as that due\nto lung disease.\nOther breathing-related sleep disorders.\nSleep-related hypoventilation can be distin-\nguished from obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and central sleep apnea based on clinical\nfeatures and findings on polysomnography. Sleep-related hypoventilation typically shows\nmore sustained periods of oxygen desaturation rather that the periodic episodes seen in\nobstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and central sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea hy-\npopnea and central sleep apnea also show a pattern of discrete episodes of repeated air-\nflow decreases that can be absent in sleep-related hypoventilation.\nComorbidity \nSleep-related hypoventilation often occurs in association with a pulmonary disorder (e.g., in-\nterstitial lung disease, COPD), with a neuromuscular or chest wall disorder (e.g., muscular\ndystrophies, post-polio syndrome, cervical spinal cord injury, obesity, kyphoscoliosis), or,\n390\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nmost relevant to the mental health provider, with medication use (e.g., benzodiazepines, opi-\nates). Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation often occurs in association with autonomic\ndysfunction and may occur in association with Hirschsprung’s disease. COPD, a disorder of\nlower airway obstruction usually associated with cigarette smoking, can result in sleep-\nrelated hypoventilation and hypoxemia. The presence of coexisting obstructive sleep apnea\nhypopnea is thought to exacerbate hypoxemia and hypercapnia during sleep and wakeful-\nness. The relationship between congenital central alveolar hypoventilation and idiopathic\nsleep-related hypoventilation is unclear; in some individuals, idiopathic sleep-related hy-\npoventilation may represent cases of late-onset congenital central alveolar hypoventilation.\nRelationship to International Classification of \nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), combines sleep-\nrelated hypoventilation and sleep-related hypoxemia under the category of sleep-related\nhypoventilation/hypoxemic syndromes. This approach to classification reflects the fre-\nquent co-occurrence of disorders that lead to hypoventilation and hypoxemia. In contrast,\nthe classification used in DSM-5 reflects evidence that there are distinct sleep-related\npathogenetic processes leading to hypoventilation.\nCircadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders\nDiagnostic Criteria\nA. A persistent or recurrent pattern of sleep disruption that is primarily due to an alteration\nof the circadian system or to a misalignment between the endogenous circadian\nrhythm and the sleep–wake schedule required by an individual’s physical environment\nor social or professional schedule. \nB. The sleep disruption leads to excessive sleepiness or insomnia, or both.\nC. The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-\ncupational, and other important areas of functioning.\nCoding note: For ICD-9-CM, code 307.45 for all subtypes. For ICD-10-CM, code is based\non subtype.\nSpecify whether:\n307.45 (G47.21) Delayed sleep phase type: A pattern of delayed sleep onset and\nawakening times, with an inability to fall asleep and awaken at a desired or convention-\nally acceptable earlier time.\nSpecify if:\nFamilial: A family history of delayed sleep phase is present.\nSpecify if:\nOverlapping with non-24-hour sleep-wake type: Delayed sleep phase type\nmay overlap with another circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, non-24-hour\nsleep-wake type. \n307.45 (G47.22) Advanced sleep phase type: A pattern of advanced sleep onset and\nawakening times, with an inability to remain awake or asleep until the desired or con-\nventionally acceptable later sleep or wake times.\nSpecify if:\nFamilial: A family history of advanced sleep phase is present. \n307.45 (G47.23) Irregular sleep-wake type: A temporally disorganized sleep-wake\npattern, such that the timing of sleep and wake periods is variable throughout the 24-\nhour period.\nCircadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders\n391\n307.45 (G47.24) Non-24-hour sleep-wake type: A pattern of sleep-wake cycles that\nis not synchronized to the 24-hour environment, with a consistent daily drift (usually to\nlater and later times) of sleep onset and wake times.\n307.45 (G47.26) Shift work type: Insomnia during the major sleep period and/or ex-\ncessive sleepiness (including inadvertent sleep) during the major awake period asso-\nciated with a shift work schedule (i.e., requiring unconventional work hours).\n307.45 (G47.20) Unspecified type\nSpecify if:\nEpisodic: Symptoms last at least 1 month but less than 3 months.\nPersistent: Symptoms last 3 months or longer.\nRecurrent: Two or more episodes occur within the space of 1 year.\nDelayed Sleep Phase Type\nDiagnostic Features\nThe delayed sleep phase type is based primarily on a history of a delay in the timing of the\nmajor sleep period (usually more than 2 hours) in relation to the desired sleep and wake-\nup time, resulting in symptoms of insomnia and excessive sleepiness. When allowed to set\ntheir own schedule, individuals with delayed sleep phase type exhibit normal sleep qual-\nity and duration for age. Symptoms of sleep-onset insomnia, difficulty waking in the\nmorning, and excessive early day sleepiness are prominent.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nCommon associated features of delayed sleep phase type include a history of mental dis-\norders or a concurrent mental disorder. Extreme and prolonged difficulty awakening with\nmorning confusion is also common. Psychophysiological insomnia may develop as a re-\nsult of maladaptive behaviors that impair sleep and increase arousal because of repeated\nattempts to fall asleep at an earlier time.\nPrevalence\nPrevalence of delayed sleep phase type in the general population is approximately 0.17%\nbut appears to be greater than 7% in adolescents. Although the prevalence of familial de-\nlayed sleep phase type has not been established, a family history of delayed sleep phase is\npresent in individuals with delayed sleep phase type. \nDevelopment and Course\nCourse is persistent, lasting longer than 3 months, with intermittent exacerbations through-\nout adulthood. Although age at onset is variable, symptoms begin typically in adolescence\nand early adulthood and persist for several months to years before diagnosis is estab-\nlished. Severity may decrease with age. Relapse of symptoms is common.\nClinical expression may vary across the lifespan depending on social, school, and work\nobligations. Exacerbation is usually triggered by a change in work or school schedule that\nrequires an early rise time. Individuals who can alter their work schedules to accommo-\ndate the delayed circadian sleep and wake timing can experience remission of symptoms. \nIncreased prevalence in adolescence may be a consequence of both physiological and be-\nhavioral factors. Hormonal changes may be involved specifically, as delayed sleep phase is as-\nsociated with the onset of puberty. Thus, delayed sleep phase type in adolescents should be\ndifferentiated from the common delay in the timing of circadian rhythms in this age group. In\nthe familial form, the course is persistent and may not improve significantly with age.\n392\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nGenetic and physiological.\nPredisposing factors may include a longer than average cir-\ncadian period, changes in light sensitivity, and impaired homeostatic sleep drive. Some in-\ndividuals with delayed sleep phase type may be hypersensitive to evening light, which\ncan serve as a delay signal to the circadian clock, or they may be hyposensitive to morning\nlight such that its phase-advancing effects are reduced. Genetic factors may play a role in\nthe pathogenesis of familial and sporadic forms of delayed sleep phase type, including\nmutations in circadian genes (e.g., PER3, CKIe).\nDiagnostic Markers\nConfirmation of the diagnosis includes a complete history and use of a sleep diary or actigra-\nphy (i.e., a wrist-worn motion detector that monitors motor activity for prolonged periods and\ncan be used as a proxy for sleep-wake patterns for at least 7 days). The period covered should\ninclude weekends, when social and occupational obligations are less strict, to ensure that the\nindividual exhibits a consistently delayed sleep-wake pattern. Biomarkers such as salivary\ndim light melatonin onset should be obtained only when the diagnosis is unclear.\nFunctional Consequences of Delayed Sleep Phase Type\nExcessive early day sleepiness is prominent. Extreme and prolonged difficulty awakening\nwith morning confusion (i.e., sleep inertia) is also common. The severity of insomnia and\nexcessive sleepiness symptoms varies substantially among individuals and largely de-\npends on the occupational and social demands on the individual. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nNormative variations in sleep.\nDelayed sleep phase type must be distinguished from\n“normal” sleep patterns in which an individual has a late schedule that does not cause\npersonal, social, or occupational distress (most commonly seen in adolescents and young\nadults).\nOther sleep disorders.\nInsomnia disorder and other circadian rhythm sleep-wake dis-\norders should be included in the differential. Excessive sleepiness may also be caused by\nother sleep disturbances, such as breathing-related sleep disorders, insomnias, sleep-\nrelated movement disorders, and medical, neurological, and mental disorders. Overnight\npolysomnography may help in evaluating for other comorbid sleep disorders, such as\nsleep apnea. The circadian nature of delayed sleep phase type, however, should differen-\ntiate it from other disorders with similar complaints.\nComorbidity\nDelayed sleep phase type is strongly associated with depression, personality disorder, and\nsomatic symptom disorder or illness anxiety disorder. In addition, comorbid sleep disor-\nders, such as insomnia disorder, restless legs syndrome, and sleep apnea, as well as depres-\nsive and bipolar disorders and anxiety disorders, can exacerbate symptoms of insomnia\nand excessive sleepiness. Delayed sleep phase type may overlap with another circadian\nrhythm sleep-wake disorder, non-24-hour sleep-wake type. Sighted individuals with non-\n24-hour sleep-wake type disorder commonly also have a history of delayed circadian sleep\nphase. \nCircadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders\n393\nAdvanced Sleep Phase Type\nSpecifiers \nAdvanced sleep phase type may be documented with the specified “familial.” Although\nthe prevalence of familial advanced sleep phase type has not been established, a family\nhistory of advanced sleep phase is present in individuals with advanced sleep phase type.\nIn this type, specific mutations demonstrate an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.\nIn the familial form, onset of symptoms may occur earlier (during childhood and early\nadulthood), the course is persistent, and the severity of symptoms may increase with age.\nDiagnostic Features\nAdvanced sleep phase type is characterized by sleep-wake times that are several hours\nearlier than desired or conventional times. Diagnosis is based primarily on a history of an\nadvance in the timing of the major sleep period (usually more than 2 hours) in relation to\nthe desired sleep and wake-up time, with symptoms of early morning insomnia and ex-\ncessive daytime sleepiness. When allowed to set their schedule, individuals with ad-\nvanced sleep phase type will exhibit normal sleep quality and duration for age. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with advanced sleep phase type are “morning types,” having earlier sleep-\nwake times, with the timing of circadian biomarkers such as melatonin and core body tem-\nperature rhythms occurring 2–4 hours earlier than normal. When required to keep a con-\nventional schedule requiring a delay of bedtime, these individuals will continue to have an\nearly rise time, leading to persistent sleep deprivation and daytime sleepiness. Use of hyp-\nnotics or alcohol to combat sleep-maintenance insomnia and stimulants to reduce daytime\nsleepiness may lead to substance abuse in these individuals. \nPrevalence\nThe estimated prevalence of advanced sleep phase type is approximately 1% in middle-\nage adults. Sleep-wake times and circadian phase advance in older individuals, probably\naccounting for increased prevalence in this population.\nDevelopment and Course\nOnset is usually in late adulthood. In the familial form, onset can be earlier. The course is typ-\nically persistent, lasting more than 3 months, but the severity may increase depending on work\nand social schedules. The advanced sleep phase type is more common in older adults. \nClinical expression may vary across the lifespan depending on social, school, and work\nobligations. Individuals who can alter their work schedules to accommodate the advanced\ncircadian sleep and wake timing can experience remission of symptoms. Increasing age\ntends to advance the sleep phase, however, it is unclear whether the common age-associ-\nated advanced sleep phase type is due solely to a change in circadian timing (as seen in the\nfamilial form) or also to age-related changes in the homeostatic regulation of sleep, result-\ning in earlier awakening. Severity, remission, and relapse of symptoms suggest lack of ad-\nherence to behavioral and environmental treatments designed to control sleep and wake\nstructure and light exposure.\n394\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nEnvironmental.\nDecreased late afternoon/early evening exposure to light and/or expo-\nsure to early morning light due to early morning awakening can increase the risk of ad-\nvanced sleep phase type by advancing circadian rhythms. By going to bed early, these\nindividuals are not exposed to light in the phase delay region of the curve, resulting in per-\npetuation of advanced phase. In familial advanced sleep phase type, a shortening of the\nendogenous circadian period can result in an advanced sleep phase, although circadian pe-\nriod does not appear to systematically decrease with age. \nGenetic and physiological.\nAdvanced sleep phase type has demonstrated an autoso-\nmal dominant mode of inheritance, including a PER2 gene mutation causing hypophos-\nphorylation of the PER2 protein and a missense mutation in CKI.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nAfrican Americans may have a shorter circadian period and larger magnitude phase ad-\nvances to light than do Caucasians, possibly increasing the risk for development of ad-\nvanced sleep phase type in this population.\nDiagnostic Markers\nA sleep diary and actigraphy may be used as diagnostic markers, as described earlier for\ndelayed sleep phase type. \nFunctional Consequences of Advanced Sleep Phase Type\nExcessive sleepiness associated with advanced sleep phase can have a negative effect on\ncognitive performance, social interaction, and safety. Use of wake-promoting agents to\ncombat sleepiness or sedatives for early morning awakening may increase potential for\nsubstance abuse.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther sleep disorders.\nBehavioral factors such as irregular sleep schedules, voluntary\nearly awakening, and exposure to light in the early morning should be considered, partic-\nularly in older adults. Careful attention should be paid to rule out other sleep-wake dis-\norders, such as insomnia disorder, and other mental disorders and medical conditions that\ncan cause early morning awakening. \nDepressive and bipolar disorders.\nBecause early morning awakening, fatigue, and sleep-\niness are prominent features of major depressive disorder, depressive and bipolar disor-\nders must also be considered. \nComorbidity\nMedical conditions and mental disorders with the symptom of early morning awakening,\nsuch as insomnia, can co-occur with the advance sleep phase type. \nIrregular Sleep-Wake Type\nDiagnostic Features\nThe diagnosis of irregular sleep-wake type is based primarily on a history of symptoms of\ninsomnia at night (during the usual sleep period) and excessive sleepiness (napping) dur-\ning the day. Irregular sleep-wake type is characterized by a lack of discernable sleep-wake\nCircadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders\n395\ncircadian rhythm. There is no major sleep period, and sleep is fragmented into at least\nthree periods during the 24-hour day. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with irregular sleep-wake type typically present with insomnia or excessive\nsleepiness, depending on the time of day. Sleep and wake periods across 24 hours are frag-\nmented, although the longest sleep period tends to occur between 2:00 A.M. and 6:00 A.M.\nand is usually less than 4 hours. A history of isolation or reclusion may occur in association\nwith the disorder and contribute to the symptoms via a lack of external stimuli to help en-\ntrain a normal pattern. Individuals or their caregivers report frequent naps throughout the\nday. Irregular sleep-wake type is most commonly associated with neurodegenerative dis-\norders, such as major neurocognitive disorder, and many neurodevelopmental disorders\nin children. \nPrevalence\nPrevalence of irregular sleep-wake type in the general population is unknown. \nDevelopment and Course\nThe course of irregular sleep-wake type is persistent. Age at onset is variable, but the dis-\norder is more common in older adults. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nTemperamental.\nNeurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s\ndisease, and Huntington’s disease, and neurodevelopmental disorders in children in-\ncrease the risk for irregular sleep-wake type. \nEnvironmental.\nDecreased exposure to environmental light and structured daytime ac-\ntivity can be associated with a low-amplitude circadian rhythm. Hospitalized individuals\nare especially prone to such weak external entraining stimuli, and even outside the hospi-\ntal setting, individuals with major neurocognitive disorder (i.e., dementia) are exposed to\nsignificantly less bright light. \nDiagnostic Markers\nA detailed sleep history and a sleep diary (by a caregiver) or actigraphy help confirm the\nirregular sleep-wake pattern.\nFunctional Consequences of \nIrregular Sleep-Wake Type\nLack of a clearly discernible major sleep and wake period in irregular sleep-wake type re-\nsults in insomnia or excessive sleepiness, depending on the time of day. Disruption of the\ncaregiver’s sleep also often occurs and is an important consideration.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nNormative variations in sleep.\nIrregular sleep-wake type should be distinguished from\na voluntary irregular sleep-wake schedule and poor sleep hygiene, which can result in in-\nsomnia and excessive sleepiness. \nOther medical conditions and mental disorders.\nOther causes of insomnia and daytime\nsleepiness, including comorbid medical conditions and mental disorders or medication,\nshould be considered. \n396\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nComorbidity\nIrregular sleep-wake type is often comorbid with neurodegenerative and neurodevelop-\nmental disorders, such as major neurocognitive disorder, intellectual disability (intellec-\ntual developmental disorder), and traumatic brain injury. It is also comorbid with other\nmedical conditions and mental disorders in which there is social isolation and/or lack of\nlight and structured activities. \nNon-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Type\nDiagnostic Features\nThe diagnosis of non-24-hour sleep-wake type is based primarily on a history of symp-\ntoms of insomnia or excessive sleepiness related to abnormal synchronization between the\n24-hour light-dark cycle and the endogenous circadian rhythm. Individuals typically pre-\nsent with periods of insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or both, which alternate with short\nasymptomatic periods. Starting with the asymptomatic period, when the individual’s\nsleep phase is aligned to the external environment, sleep latency will gradually increase\nand the individual will complain of sleep-onset insomnia. As the sleep phase continues to\ndrift so that sleep time is now in the daytime, the individual will have trouble staying\nawake during the day and will complain of sleepiness. Because the circadian period is not\naligned to the external 24-hour environment, symptoms will depend on when an individ-\nual tries to sleep in relation to the circadian rhythm of sleep propensity. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nNon-24-hour sleep-wake type is most common among blind or visually impaired individ-\nuals who have decreased light perception. In sighted individuals, there is often a history of\ndelayed sleep phase and of decreased exposure to light and structured social and physical\nactivity. Sighted individuals with non-24-hour sleep-wake type also demonstrate in-\ncreased sleep duration.\nPrevalence\nPrevalence of non-24-hour sleep-wake type in the general population is unclear, but the\ndisorder appears rare in sighted individuals. The prevalence in blind individuals is esti-\nmated to be 50%.\nDevelopment and Course\nCourse of non-24-hour sleep-wake type is persistent, with intermittent remission and ex-\nacerbations due to changes in work and social schedules throughout the lifespan. Age at\nonset is variable, depending on the onset of visual impairment. In sighted individuals, be-\ncause of the overlap with delayed sleep phase type, non-24-hour sleep-wake type may de-\nvelop in adolescence or early adulthood. Remission and relapse of symptoms in blind and\nsighted individuals largely depend on adherence to treatments designed to control sleep\nand wake structure and light exposure.\nClinical expression may vary across the lifespan depending on social, school, and work\nobligations. In adolescents and adults, irregular sleep-wake schedules and exposure to\nlight or lack of light at critical times of the day can exacerbate the effects of sleep loss and\ndisrupt circadian entrainment. Consequently, symptoms of insomnia, daytime sleepiness,\nand school, professional, and interpersonal functioning may worsen.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nEnvironmental.\nIn sighted individuals, decreased exposure or sensitivity to light and so-\ncial and physical activity cues may contribute to a free-running circadian rhythm. With the\nCircadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders\n397\nhigh frequency of mental disorders involving social isolation and cases of non-24-hour\nsleep-wake type developing after a change in sleep habits (e.g., night shift work, job loss),\nbehavioral factors in combination with physiological tendency may precipitate and per-\npetuate this disorder in sighted individuals. Hospitalized individuals with neurological and\npsychiatric disorders can become insensitive to social cues, predisposing them to the de-\nvelopment of non-24-hour sleep-wake type.\nGenetic and physiological.\nBlindness is a risk factor for non-24-hour sleep-wake type.\nNon-24-hour sleep-wake type has been associated with traumatic brain injury.\nDiagnostic Markers\nDiagnosis is confirmed by history and sleep diary or actigraphy for an extended period.\nSequential measurement of phase markers (e.g., melatonin) can help determine circadian\nphase in both sighted and blind individuals.\nFunctional Consequences of \nNon-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Type\nComplaints of insomnia (sleep onset and sleep maintenance), excessive sleepiness, or both\nare prominent. The unpredictability of sleep and wake times (typically a daily delay drift)\nresults in an inability to attend school or maintain a steady job and may increase potential\nfor social isolation. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nCircadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders.\nIn sighted individuals, non-24-hour sleep-wake\ntype should be differentiated from delayed sleep phase type, as individuals with delayed\nsleep phase type may display a similar progressive delay in sleep period for several days. \nDepressive disorders.\nDepressive symptoms and depressive disorders may result in\nsimilar circadian dysregulation and symptoms. \nComorbidity\nBlindness is often comorbid with non-24-hour sleep-wake type, as are depressive and bi-\npolar disorders with social isolation.\nShift Work Type\nDiagnostic Features\nDiagnosis is primarily based on a history of the individual working outside of the normal\n8:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. daytime window (particularly at night) on a regularly scheduled (i.e.,\nnon-overtime) basis. Symptoms of excessive sleepiness at work, and impaired sleep at\nhome, on a persistent basis are prominent. Presence of both sets of symptoms are usually\nrequired for a diagnosis of shift work type. Typically, when the individual reverts to a day-\nwork routine, symptoms resolve. Although the etiology is slightly different, individuals\nwho travel across many time zones on a very frequent basis may experience effects similar\nto those experienced by individuals with shift work type who work rotating shifts. \nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of shift work type is unclear, but the disorder is estimated to affect 5%–10%\nof the night worker population (16%–20% of the workforce). Prevalence rises with advance-\nment into middle-age and beyond (Drake et al. 2004).\n398\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nDevelopment and Course\nShift work type can appear in individuals of any age but is more prevalent in individuals\nolder than 50 years and typically worsens with the passage of time if the disruptive work\nhours persist. Although older adults may show similar rates of circadian phase adjust-\nment to a change in routine as do younger adults, they appear to experience significantly\nmore sleep disruption as a consequence of the circadian phase shift.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nTemperamental.\nPredisposing factors include a morning-type disposition, a need for\nlong (i.e., more than 8 hours) sleep durations in order to feel well rested, and strong com-\npeting social and domestic needs (e.g., parents of young children). Individuals who are able\nto commit to a nocturnal lifestyle, with few competing day-oriented demands, appear at\nlower risk for shift work type. \nGenetic and physiological.\nBecause shift workers are more likely than day workers to\nbe obese, obstructive sleep apnea may be present and may exacerbate the symptoms.\nDiagnostic Markers\nA history and sleep diary or actigraphy may be useful in diagnosis, as discussed earlier for\ndelayed sleep phase type. \nFunctional Consequences of Shift Work Type \nIndividuals with shift work type not only may perform poorly at work but also appear to\nbe at risk for accidents both at work and on the drive home. They may also be at risk for\npoor mental health (e.g., alcohol use disorder, substance use disorder, depression) and\nphysical health (e.g., gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer).\nIndividuals with a history of bipolar disorder are particularly vulnerable to shift work\ntype–related episodes of mania resulting from missed nights of sleep. Shift work type of-\nten results in interpersonal problems. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nNormative variations in sleep with shift work.\nThe diagnosis of shift work type, as op-\nposed to the “normal” difficulties of shift work, must depend to some extent on the sever-\nity of symptoms and/or level of distress experienced by the individual. Presence of shift\nwork type symptoms even when the individual is able to live on a day-oriented routine for\nseveral weeks at a time may suggest the presence of other sleep disorders, such as sleep ap-\nnea, insomnia, and narcolepsy, which should be ruled out. \nComorbidity\nShift work type has been associated with increased alcohol use disorder, other substance\nuse disorders, and depression. A variety of physical health disorders (e.g., gastrointestinal\ndisorders, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer) have been found to be associated with\nprolonged exposure to shift work.\nRelationship to International Classification of \nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), differentiates nine\ncircadian rhythm sleep disorders, including jet lag type.\nNon–Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal Disorders\n399\nParasomnias \nParasomnias are disorders characterized by abnormal behavioral, experiential, or physio-\nlogical events occurring in association with sleep, specific sleep stages, or sleep-wake tran-\nsitions.

The maximum duration of an event is unknown. The eyes\nare typically open during these events. Many individuals exhibit both subtypes of arousals\non different occasions, which underscores the unitary underlying pathophysiology. The\nsubtypes reflect varying degrees of simultaneous occurrence of wakefulness and NREM\nsleep, resulting in complex behaviors arising from sleep with varying degrees of conscious\nawareness, motor activity, and autonomic activation.\nThe essential feature of sleepwalking is repeated episodes of complex motor behavior\ninitiated during sleep, including rising from bed and walking about (Criterion A1). Sleep-\nwalking episodes begin during any stage of NREM sleep, most commonly during slow-\nwave sleep and therefore most often occurring during the first third of the night. During\nepisodes, the individual has reduced alertness and responsiveness, a blank stare, and rel-\native unresponsiveness to communication with others or efforts by others to awaken the\nindividual. If awakened during the episode (or on awakening the following morning), the\nindividual has limited recall for the episode. After the episode, there may initially be a brief\nperiod of confusion or difficulty orienting, followed by full recovery of cognitive function\nand appropriate behavior. \nThe essential feature of sleep terrors is the repeated occurrence of precipitous awaken-\nings from sleep, usually beginning with a panicky scream or cry (Criterion A2). Sleep ter-\nrors usually begin during the first third of the major sleep episode and last 1–10 minutes,\nbut they may last considerably longer, particularly in children. The episodes are accom-\npanied by impressive autonomic arousal and behavioral manifestations of intense fear.\nDuring an episode, the individual is difficult to awaken or comfort. If the individual awak-\nens after the sleep terror, little or none of the dream, or only fragmentary, single images,\nare recalled. During a typical episode of sleep terrors, the individual abruptly sits up in\nbed screaming or crying, with a frightened expression and autonomic signs of intense anx-\niety (e.g., tachycardia, rapid breathing, sweating, dilation of the pupils). The individual\nmay be inconsolable and is usually unresponsive to the efforts of others to awaken or com-\nfort him or her. Sleep terrors are also called “night terrors” or “pavor nocturnus.”\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nSleepwalking episodes can include a wide variety of behaviors. Episodes may begin with\nconfusion: the individual may simply sit up in bed, look about, or pick at the blanket or\nsheet. This behavior then becomes progressively complex. The individual may actually\nleave the bed and walk into closets, out of the room, and even out of buildings. Individuals\nmay use the bathroom, eat, talk, or engage in more complex behaviors. Running and fran-\ntic attempts to escape some apparent threat can also occur. Most behaviors during sleep-\nwalking episodes are routine and of low complexity. However, cases of unlocking doors\nand even operating machinery (driving an automobile) have been reported. Sleepwalking\ncan also include inappropriate behavior (e.g., commonly, urinating in a closet or waste-\nbasket). Most episodes last for several minutes to a half hour but may be more protracted.\nInasmuch as sleep is a state of relative analgesia, painful injuries sustained during sleep-\nwalking may not be appreciated until awakening after the fact.\nThere are two “specialized” forms of sleepwalking: sleep-related eating behavior and\nsleep-related sexual behavior (sexsomnia or sleep sex). Individuals with sleep-related eating\nexperience unwanted recurrent episodes of eating with varying degrees of amnesia, rang-\ning from no awareness to full awareness without the ability to not eat. During these epi-\nsodes, inappropriate foods may be ingested. Individuals with sleep-related eating disorder\nmay find evidence of their eating only the next morning. In sexsomnia, varying degrees of\nNon–Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal Disorders\n401\nsexual activity (e.g., masturbation, fondling, groping, sexual intercourse) occur as complex\nbehaviors arising from sleep without conscious awareness. This condition is more common\nin males and may result in serious interpersonal relationship problems or medicolegal\nconsequences.\nDuring a typical episode of sleep terrors, there is often a sense of overwhelming dread,\nwith a compulsion to escape. Although fragmentary vivid dream images may occur, a story-\nlike dream sequence (as in nightmares) is not reported. Most commonly, the individual does\nnot awaken fully, but returns to sleep and has amnesia for the episode on awakening the next\nmorning. Usually only one episode will occur on any one night. Occasionally several episodes\nmay occur at intervals throughout the night. These events rarely arise during daytime naps. \nPrevalence\nIsolated or infrequent NREM sleep arousal disorders are very common in the general pop-\nulation. From 10% to 30% of children have had at least one episode of sleepwalking, and\n2%–3% sleepwalk often. The prevalence of sleepwalking disorder, marked by repeated ep-\nisodes and impairment or distress, is much lower, probably in the range of 1%–5%. The\nprevalence of sleepwalking episodes (not sleepwalking disorder) is 1.0%–7.0% among\nadults, with weekly to monthly episodes occurring in 0.5%–0.7%. The lifetime prevalence\nof sleepwalking in adults is 29.2%, with a past-year prevalence of sleepwalking of 3.6%.\nThe prevalence of sleep terrors in the general population is unknown. The prevalence\nof sleep terror episodes (as opposed to sleep terror disorder, in which there is recurrence\nand distress or impairment) is approximately 36.9% at 18 months of age, 19.7% at 30 months\nof age, and 2.2% in adults. \nDevelopment and Course\nNREM sleep arousal disorders occur most commonly in childhood and diminish in fre-\nquency with increasing age. The onset of sleepwalking in adults with no prior history of\nsleepwalking as children should prompt a search for specific etiologies, such as obstruc-\ntive sleep apnea, nocturnal seizures, or effect of medication. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nEnvironmental.\nSedative use, sleep deprivation, sleep-wake schedule disruptions, fa-\ntigue, and physical or emotional stress increase the likelihood of episodes. Fever and sleep\ndeprivation can produce an increased frequency of NREM sleep arousal disorders. \nGenetic and physiological.\nA family history for sleepwalking or sleep terrors may oc-\ncur in up to 80% of individuals who sleepwalk. The risk for sleepwalking is further in-\ncreased (to as much as 60% of offspring) when both parents have a history of the disorder.\nIndividuals with sleep terrors frequently have a positive family history of either sleep\nterrors or sleepwalking, with as high as a 10-fold increase in the prevalence of the disorder\namong first-degree biological relatives. Sleep terrors are much more common in monozy-\ngotic twins as compared with dizygotic twins. The exact mode of inheritance is unknown.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nViolent or sexual activity during sleepwalking episodes is more likely to occur in adults.\nEating during sleepwalking episodes is more commonly seen in females. Sleepwalking oc-\ncurs more often in females during childhood but more often in males during adulthood. \nOlder children and adults provide a more detailed recollection of fearful images asso-\nciated with sleep terrors than do younger children, who are more likely to have complete\namnesia or report only a vague sense of fear. Among children, sleep terrors are more com-\nmon in males than in females. Among adults, the sex ratio is even.\n402\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nDiagnostic Markers\nNREM sleep arousal disorders arise from any stage of NREM sleep but most commonly\nfrom deep NREM sleep (slow-wave sleep). They are most likely to appear in the first third\nof the night and do not commonly occur during daytime naps. During the episode, the\npolysomnogram may be obscured with movement artifact. In the absence of such artifact,\nthe electroencephalogram typically shows theta or alpha frequency activity during the ep-\nisode, indicating partial or incomplete arousal. \nPolysomnography in conjunction with audiovisual monitoring can be used to document\nepisodes of sleepwalking. In the absence of actually capturing an event during a polysomno-\ngraphic recording, there are no polysomnographic features that can serve as a marker for\nsleepwalking. Sleep deprivation may increase the likelihood of capturing an event. As a group,\nindividuals who sleepwalk show instability of deep NREM sleep, but the overlap in findings\nwith individuals who do not sleepwalk is great enough to preclude use of this indicator in es-\ntablishing a diagnosis. Unlike arousals from REM sleep associated with nightmares, in which\nthere is an increase in heart rate and respiration prior to the arousal, the NREM sleep arousals\nof sleep terrors begin precipitously from sleep, without anticipatory autonomic changes. The\narousals are associated with impressive autonomic activity, with doubling or tripling of\nthe heart rate. The pathophysiology is poorly understood, but there appears to be instability in\nthe deeper stages of NREM sleep. Absent capturing an event during a formal sleep study,\nthere are no reliable polysomnographic indicators of the tendency to experience sleep terrors.\nFunctional Consequences of \nNon-REM Sleep Arousal Disorders\nFor the diagnosis of a NREM sleep arousal disorder to be made, the individual or house-\nhold members must experience clinically significant distress or impairment, although pa-\nrasomnia symptoms may occur occasionally in nonclinical populations and would be\nsubthreshold for the diagnosis. Embarrassment concerning the episodes can impair social\nrelationships. Social isolation or occupational difficulties can result. The determination of a\n“disorder” depends on a number of factors, which may vary on an individual basis and\nwill depend on the frequency of events, potential for violence or injurious behaviors, em-\nbarrassment, or disruption/distress of other household members. Severity determination\nis best made based on the nature or consequence of the behaviors rather than simply on fre-\nquency. Uncommonly, NREM sleep arousal disorders may result in serious injury to the\nindividual or to someone trying to console the individual. Injuries to others are confined to\nthose in close proximity; individuals are not “sought out.” Typically, sleepwalking in both\nchildren and adults is not associated with significant mental disorders. For individuals\nwith sleep-related eating behaviors, unknowingly preparing or eating food during the\nsleep period may create problems such as poor diabetes control, weight gain, injury (cuts\nand burns), or consequences of eating dangerous or toxic inedibles. NREM sleep arousal\ndisorders may rarely result in violent or injurious behaviors with forensic implications.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nNightmare disorder.\nIn contrast to individuals with NREM sleep arousal disorders, in-\ndividuals with nightmare disorder typically awaken easily and completely, report vivid\nstorylike dreams accompanying the episodes, and tend to have episodes later in the night.\nNREM sleep arousal disorders occur during NREM sleep, whereas nightmares usually oc-\ncur during REM sleep. Parents of children with NREM sleep arousal disorders may mis-\ninterpret reports of fragmentary imagery as nightmares.\nBreathing-related sleep disorders.\nBreathing disorders during sleep can also produce\nconfusional arousals with subsequent amnesia. However, breathing-related sleep disor-\nders are also characterized by characteristic symptoms of snoring, breathing pauses, and\nNon–Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal Disorders\n403\ndaytime sleepiness. In some individuals, a breathing-related sleep disorder may precipi-\ntate episodes of sleepwalking.\nREM sleep behavior disorder.\nREM sleep behavior disorder may be difficult to distin-\nguish from NREM sleep arousal disorders. REM sleep behavior disorder is characterized\nby episodes of prominent, complex movements, often involving personal injury arising\nfrom sleep. In contrast to NREM sleep arousal disorders, REM sleep behavior disorder oc-\ncurs during REM sleep. Individuals with REM sleep behavior disorder awaken easily and\nreport more detailed and vivid dream content than do individuals with NREM sleep arousal\ndisorders. They often report that they “act out dreams.” \nParasomnia overlap syndrome.\nParasomnia overlap syndrome consists of clinical and\npolysomnographic features of both sleepwalking and REM sleep behavior disorder.\nSleep-related seizures.\nSome types of seizures can produce episodes of very unusual\nbehaviors that occur predominantly or exclusively during sleep. Nocturnal seizures may\nclosely mimic NREM sleep arousal disorders but tend to be more stereotypic in nature, oc-\ncur multiple times nightly, and be more likely to occur from daytime naps. The presence of\nsleep-related seizures does not preclude the presence of NREM sleep arousal disorders.\nSleep-related seizures should be classified as a form of epilepsy.\nAlcohol-induced blackouts.\nAlcohol-induced blackouts may be associated with extremely\ncomplex behaviors in the absence of other suggestions of intoxication. They do not involve\nthe loss of consciousness but rather reflect an isolated disruption of memory for events\nduring a drinking episode. By history, these behaviors may be indistinguishable from those\nseen in NREM sleep arousal disorders.\nDissociative amnesia, with dissociative fugue.\nDissociative fugue may be extremely\ndifficult to distinguish from sleepwalking. Unlike all other parasomnias, nocturnal disso-\nciative fugue arises from a period of wakefulness during sleep, rather than precipitously\nfrom sleep without intervening wakefulness. A history of recurrent childhood physical or\nsexual abuse is usually present (but may be difficult to obtain).\nMalingering or other voluntary behavior occurring during wakefulness.\nAs with disso-\nciative fugue, malingering or other voluntary behavior occurring during wakefulness\narises from wakefulness.\nPanic disorder.\nPanic attacks may also cause abrupt awakenings from deep NREM sleep\naccompanied by fearfulness, but these episodes produce rapid and complete awakening with-\nout the confusion, amnesia, or motor activity typical of NREM sleep arousal disorders. \nMedication-induced complex behaviors.\nBehaviors similar to those in NREM sleep\narousal disorders can be induced by use of, or withdrawal from, substances or medica-\ntions (e.g., benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics, opiates, cocaine, nic-\notine, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, chloral hydrate). Such behaviors may arise\nfrom the sleep period and may be extremely complex. The underlying pathophysiology\nappears to be a relatively isolated amnesia. In such cases, substance/medication-induced\nsleep disorder, parasomnia type, should be diagnosed (see “Substance/Medication-\nInduced Sleep Disorder” later in this chapter).\nNight eating syndrome.\nThe sleep-related eating disorder form of sleepwalking is to be\ndifferentiated from night eating syndrome, in which there is a delay in the circadian rhythm\nof food ingestion and an association with insomnia and/or depression. \nComorbidity\nIn adults, there is an association between sleepwalking and major depressive episodes and\nobsessive-compulsive disorder. Children or adults with sleep terrors may have elevated\nscores for depression and anxiety on personality inventories. \n404\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nRelationship to International Classification of \nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition, includes “confusional\narousal” as a NREM sleep arousal disorder.", "provenance": {"source_file": "sleep_wake_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 8, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.545324"}}

They arise\nNightmare Disorder\n405\nalmost exclusively during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and can thus occur through-\nout sleep but are more likely in the second half of the major sleep episode when dreaming\nis longer and more intense. Factors that increase early-night REM intensity, such as sleep\nfragmentation or deprivation, jet lag, and REM-sensitive medications, might facilitate\nnightmares earlier in the night, including at sleep onset.\nNightmares usually terminate with awakening and rapid return of full alertness. How-\never, the dysphoric emotions may persist into wakefulness and contribute to difficulty re-\nturning to sleep and lasting daytime distress. Some nightmares, known as “bad dreams,”\nmay not induce awakening and are recalled only later. If nightmares occur during sleep-\nonset REM periods (hypnagogic), the dysphoric emotion is frequently accompanied by a\nsense of being both awake and unable to move voluntarily (isolated sleep paralysis). \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nMild autonomic arousal, including sweating, tachycardia, and tachypnea, may character-\nize nightmares. Body movements and vocalizations are not characteristic because of REM\nsleep–related loss of skeletal muscle tone, but such behaviors may occur under situations\nof emotional stress or sleep fragmentation and in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nWhen talking or emoting occurs, it is typically a brief event terminating the nightmare. \nIndividuals with frequent nightmares are at substantially greater risk for suicidal ide-\nation and suicide attempts, even when gender and mental illness are taken into account. \nPrevalence\nPrevalence of nightmares increases through childhood into adolescence. From 1.3% to\n3.9% of parents report that their preschool children have nightmares “often” or “always”.\nPrevalence increases from ages 10 to 13 for both males and females but continues to in-\ncrease to ages 20–29 for females (while decreasing for males), when it can be twice as high\nfor females as for males. Prevalence decreases steadily with age for both sexes, but the gen-\nder difference remains. Among adults, prevalence of nightmares at least monthly is 6%,\nwhereas prevalence for frequent nightmares is 1%–2%. Estimates often combine idio-\npathic and posttraumatic nightmares indiscriminately.\nDevelopment and Course\nNightmares often begin between ages 3 and 6 years but reach a peak prevalence and se-\nverity in late adolescence or early adulthood. Nightmares most likely appear in children\nexposed to acute or chronic psychosocial stressors and thus may not resolve spontane-\nously. In a minority, frequent nightmares persist into adulthood, becoming virtually a life-\nlong disturbance. Although specific nightmare content may reflect the individual’s age,\nthe essential features of the disorder are the same across age groups. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nTemperamental.\nIndividuals who experience nightmares report more frequent past ad-\nverse events, but not necessarily trauma, and often display personality disturbances or\npsychiatric diagnosis. \nEnvironmental.\nSleep deprivation or fragmentation, and irregular sleep-wake schedules\nthat alter the timing, intensity, or quantity of REM sleep, can put individuals at risk for\nnightmares.\nGenetic and physiological.\nTwin studies have identified genetic effects on the disposi-\ntion to nightmares and their co-occurrence with other parasomnias (e.g., sleeptalking). \nCourse modifiers.\nAdaptive parental bedside behaviors, such as soothing the child fol-\nlowing nightmares, may protect against developing chronic nightmares. \n406\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nThe significance attributed to nightmares may vary by culture, and sensitivity to such be-\nliefs may facilitate disclosure.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nAdult females report having nightmares more frequently than do adult males. Nightmare\ncontent differs by sex, with adult females tending to report themes of sexual harassment or\nof loved ones disappearing/dying, and adult males tending to report themes of physical\naggression or war/terror. \nDiagnostic Markers\nPolysomnographic studies demonstrate abrupt awakenings from REM sleep, usually during\nthe second half of the night, prior to report of a nightmare. Heart, respiratory, and eye move-\nment rates may quicken or increase in variability before awakening. Nightmares following\ntraumatic events may also arise during non-REM (NREM), particularly stage 2, sleep. The typ-\nical sleep of individuals with nightmares is mildly impaired (e.g., reduced efficiency, less slow-\nwave sleep, more awakenings), with more frequent periodic leg movements in sleep and rel-\native sympathetic nervous system activation after REM sleep deprivation. \nFunctional Consequences of Nightmare Disorder\nNightmares cause more significant subjective distress than demonstrable social or occu-\npational impairment. However, if awakenings are frequent or result in sleep avoidance,\nindividuals may experience excessive daytime sleepiness, poor concentration, depression,\nanxiety, or irritability. Frequent childhood nightmares (e.g., several per week), may cause\nsignificant distress to parents and child.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nSleep terror disorder.\nBoth nightmare disorder and sleep terror disorder include awak-\nenings or partial awakenings with fearfulness and autonomic activation, but the two dis-\norders are differentiable. Nightmares typically occur later in the night, during REM sleep,\nand produce vivid, storylike, and clearly recalled dreams; mild autonomic arousal; and\ncomplete awakenings. Sleep terrors typically arise in the first third of the night during\nstage 3 or 4 NREM sleep and produce either no dream recall or images without an elabo-\nrate storylike quality. The terrors lead to partial awakenings that leave the individual con-\nfused, disoriented, and only partially responsive and with substantial autonomic arousal.\nThere is usually amnesia for the event in the morning. \nREM sleep behavior disorder.\nThe presence of complex motor activity during fright-\nening dreams should prompt further evaluation for REM sleep behavior disorder, which\noccurs more typically among late middle-age males and, unlike nightmare disorder, is as-\nsociated with often violent dream enactments and a history of nocturnal injuries. The\ndream disturbance of REM sleep behavior disorder is described by patients as nightmares\nbut is controlled by appropriate medication. \nBereavement.\nDysphoric dreams may occur during bereavement but typically involve\nloss and sadness and are followed by self-reflection and insight, rather than distress, on\nawakening. \nNarcolepsy.\nNightmares are a frequent complaint in narcolepsy, but the presence of ex-\ncessive sleepiness and cataplexy differentiates this condition from nightmare disorder. \nNocturnal seizures.\nSeizures may rarely manifest as nightmares and should be evalu-\nated with polysomnography and continuous video electroencephalography. Nocturnal\nseizures usually involve stereotypical motor activity. Associated nightmares, if recalled,\nRapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder\n407\nare often repetitive in nature or reflect epileptogenic features such as the content of diurnal\nauras (e.g., unmotivated dread), phosphenes, or ictal imagery. Disorders of arousal, espe-\ncially confusional arousals, may also be present.\nBreathing-related sleep disorders.\nBreathing-related sleep disorders can lead to awaken-\nings with autonomic arousal, but these are not usually accompanied by recall of nightmares. \nPanic disorder.\nAttacks arising during sleep can produce abrupt awakenings with au-\ntonomic arousal and fearfulness, but nightmares are typically not reported and symptoms\nare similar to panic attacks arising during wakefulness. \nSleep-related dissociative disorders.\nIndividuals may recall actual physical or emo-\ntional trauma as a “dream” during electroencephalography-documented awakenings.\nMedication or substance use.\nNumerous substances/medications can precipitate night-\nmares, including dopaminergics; beta-adrenergic antagonists and other antihypertensives;\namphetamine, cocaine, and other stimulants; antidepressants; smoking cessation aids;\nand melatonin. Withdrawal of REM sleep–suppressant medications (e.g., antidepressants)\nand alcohol can produce REM sleep rebound accompanied by nightmares. If nightmares\nare sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention, a diagnosis of substance/\nmedication-induced sleep disorder should be considered. \nComorbidity\nNightmares may be comorbid with several medical conditions, including coronary heart\ndisease, cancer, parkinsonism, and pain, and can accompany medical treatments, such as he-\nmodialysis, or withdrawal from medications or substances of abuse. Nightmares frequently\nare comorbid with other mental disorders, including PTSD; insomnia disorder; schizophrenia;\npsychosis; mood, anxiety, adjustment, and personality disorders; and grief during be-\nreavement. A concurrent nightmare disorder diagnosis should only be considered when in-\ndependent clinical attention is warranted (i.e., Criteria A–C are met). Otherwise, no separate\ndiagnosis is necessary. These conditions should be listed under the appropriate comorbid\ncategory specifier. However, nightmare disorder may be diagnosed as a separate disorder in\nindividuals with PTSD if the nightmares are temporally unrelated to PTSD (i.e., preceding\nother PTSD symptoms or persisting after other PTSD symptoms have resolved).\nNightmares are normally characteristic of REM sleep behavior disorder, PTSD, and acute\nstress disorder, but nightmare disorder may be independently coded if nightmares preceded\nthe condition and their frequency or severity necessitates independent clinical attention. The\nlatter may be determined by asking whether nightmares were a problem before onset of the\nother disorder and whether they continued after other symptoms had remitted. \nRelationship to International Classification of \nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), presents similar di-\nagnostic criteria for nightmare disorder.", "provenance": {"source_file": "sleep_wake_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 9, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.545324"}}

The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a\ndrug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.\nG. Coexisting mental and medical disorders do not explain the episodes.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder is repeated\nepisodes of arousal, often associated with vocalizations and/or complex motor behaviors\narising from REM sleep (Criterion A). These behaviors often reflect motor responses to the\ncontent of action-filled or violent dreams of being attacked or trying to escape from a\nthreatening situation, which may be termed dream enacting behaviors. The vocalizations are\noften loud, emotion-filled, and profane. These behaviors may be very bothersome to the\nindividual and the bed partner and may result in significant injury (e.g., falling, jumping,\nor flying out of bed; running, punching, thrusting, hitting, or kicking). Upon awakening,\nthe individual is immediately awake, alert, and oriented (Criterion C) and is often able to\nrecall dream mentation, which closely correlates with the observed behavior. The eyes\ntypically remain closed during these events. The diagnosis of REM sleep behavior disor-\nder requires clinically significant distress or impairment (Criterion E); this determination\nwill depend on a number of factors, including the frequency of events, the potential for vi-\nolence or injurious behaviors, embarrassment, and distress in other household members. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nSeverity determination is best made based on the nature or consequence of the behavior\nrather than simply on frequency. Although the behaviors are typically prominent and vi-\nolent, lesser behaviors may also occur. \nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of REM sleep behavior disorder is approximately 0.38%–0.5% in the gen-\neral population. Prevalence in patients with psychiatric disorders may be greater, possibly\nrelated to medications prescribed for the psychiatric disorder.\nDevelopment and Course\nThe onset of REM sleep behavior disorder may be gradual or rapid, and the course is usu-\nally progressive. REM sleep behavior disorder associated with neurodegenerative disor-\nders may improve as the underlying neurodegenerative disorder progresses. Because of\nthe very high association with the later appearance of an underlying neurodegenerative\ndisorder, most notably one of the synucleinopathies (Parkinson’s disease, multiple system\natrophy, or major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies), the neurological\nstatus of individuals with REM sleep behavior disorder should be closely monitored.\nREM sleep behavior disorder overwhelmingly affects males older than 50 years, but in-\ncreasingly this disorder is being identified in females and in younger individuals. Symp-\nRapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder\n409\ntoms in young individuals, particularly young females, should raise the possibility of\nnarcolepsy or medication-induced REM sleep behavior disorder. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nGenetic and physiological.\nMany widely prescribed medications, including tricyclic\nantidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reup-\ntake inhibitors, and beta-blockers, may result in polysomnographic evidence of REM sleep\nwithout atonia and in frank REM sleep behavior disorder. It is not known whether the\nmedications per se result in REM sleep behavior disorder or they unmask an underlying\npredisposition.\nDiagnostic Markers\nAssociated laboratory findings from polysomnography indicate increased tonic and/or\nphasic electromyographic activity during REM sleep that is normally associated with mus-\ncle atonia. The increased muscle activity variably affects different muscle groups, mandating\nmore extensive electromyographic monitoring than is employed in conventional sleep stud-\nies. For this reason, it is suggested that electromyographic monitoring include the submen-\ntalis, bilateral extensor digitorum, and bilateral anterior tibialis muscle groups. Continuous\nvideo monitoring is mandatory. Other polysomnographic findings may include very fre-\nquent periodic and aperiodic extremity electromyography activity during non-REM\n(NREM) sleep. This polysomnography observation, termed REM sleep without atonia, is pres-\nent in virtually all cases of REM sleep behavior disorder but may also be an asymptomatic\npolysomnographic finding. Clinical dream-enacting behaviors coupled with the polysom-\nnographic finding of REM without atonia is necessary for the diagnosis of REM sleep behav-\nior disorder. REM sleep without atonia without a clinical history of dream-enacting\nbehaviors is simply an asymptomatic polysomnographic observation. It is not known\nwhether isolated REM sleep without atonia is a precursor to REM sleep behavior disorder.\nFunctional Consequences of \nRapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder\nREM sleep behavior disorder may occur in isolated occasions in otherwise unaffected in-\ndividuals. Embarrassment concerning the episodes can impair social relationships. Indi-\nviduals may avoid situations in which others might become aware of the disturbance,\nvisiting friends overnight, or sleeping with bed partners. Social isolation or occupational\ndifficulties can result. Uncommonly, REM sleep behavior disorder may result in serious\ninjury to the victim or to the bed partner.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther parasomnias.\nConfusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors can easily be\nconfused with REM sleep behavior disorder. In general, these disorders occur in younger\nindividuals. Unlike REM sleep behavior disorder, they arise from deep NREM sleep and\ntherefore tend to occur in the early portion of the sleep period. Awakening from a confu-\nsional arousal is associated with confusion, disorientation, and incomplete recall of dream\nmentation accompanying the behavior. Polysomnographic monitoring in the disorders of\narousal reveals normal REM atonia.\nNocturnal seizures.\nNocturnal seizures may perfectly mimic REM sleep behavior disor-\nder, but the behaviors are generally more stereotyped. Polysomnographic monitoring em-\nploying a full electroencephalographic seizure montage may differentiate the two. REM\nsleep without atonia is not present on polysomnographic monitoring.\n410\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nObstructive sleep apnea.\nObstructive sleep apnea may result in behaviors indistin-\nguishable from REM sleep behavior disorder. Polysomnographic monitoring is necessary\nto differentiate between the two. In this case, the symptoms resolve following effective\ntreatment of the obstructive sleep apnea, and REM sleep without atonia is not present on\npolysomnography monitoring.\nOther specified dissociative disorder (sleep-related psychogenic dissociative disorder).\nUnlike virtually all other parasomnias, which arise precipitously from NREM or REM\nsleep, psychogenic dissociative behaviors arise from a period of well-defined wakefulness\nduring the sleep period. Unlike REM sleep behavior disorder, this condition is more prev-\nalent in young females.\nMalingering.\nMany cases of malingering in which the individual reports problematic\nsleep movements perfectly mimic the clinical features of REM sleep behavior disorder,\nand polysomnographic documentation is mandatory.\nComorbidity\nREM sleep behavior disorder is present concurrently in approximately 30% of patients\nwith narcolepsy. When it occurs in narcolepsy, the demographics reflect the younger age\nrange of narcolepsy, with equal frequency in males and females. Based on findings from\nindividuals presenting to sleep clinics, most individuals (>50%) with initially “idiopathic”\nREM sleep behavior disorder will eventually develop a neurodegenerative disease—most\nnotably, one of the synucleinopathies (Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy, or\nmajor or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies). REM sleep behavior disorder\noften predates any other sign of these disorders by many years (often more than a decade).\nRelationship to International Classification of \nSleep Disorders\nREM sleep behavior disorder is virtually identical to REM sleep behavior disorder in the\nInternational Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2).", "provenance": {"source_file": "sleep_wake_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 10, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.546322"}}

The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a drug of abuse or\nmedication (e.g., akathisia).\nRestless Legs Syndrome\n411\nDiagnostic Features\nRestless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor, neurological sleep disorder characterized\nby a desire to move the legs or arms, usually associated with uncomfortable sensations\ntypically described as creeping, crawling, tingling, burning, or itching (Criterion A). The\ndiagnosis of RLS is based primarily on patient self-report and history. Symptoms are\nworse when the individual is at rest, and frequent movements of the legs occur in an effort\nto relieve the uncomfortable sensations. Symptoms are worse in the evening or night, and\nin some individuals they occur only in the evening or night. Evening worsening occurs in-\ndependently of any differences in activity. It is important to differentiate RLS from other\nconditions such as positional discomfort and leg cramps (Criterion D).\nThe symptoms of RLS can delay sleep onset and awaken the individual from sleep and\nare associated with significant sleep fragmentation. The relief obtained from moving the\nlegs may no longer be apparent in severe cases. RLS is associated with daytime sleepiness\nand is frequently accompanied by significant clinical distress or functional impairment.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nPeriodic leg movements in sleep (PLMS) can serve as corroborating evidence for RLS, with\nup to 90% of individuals diagnosed with RLS demonstrating PLMS when recordings are\ntaken over multiple nights. Periodic leg movements during wakefulness are supportive of\nan RLS diagnosis. Reports of difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep and of excessive\ndaytime sleepiness may also support the diagnosis of RLS. Additional supportive features\ninclude a family history of RLS among first-degree relatives and a reduction in symptoms,\nat least initially, with dopaminergic treatment. \nPrevalence \nPrevalence rates of RLS vary widely when broad criteria are utilized but range from 2% to\n7.2% when more defined criteria are employed. When frequency of symptoms is at least\nthree times per week with moderate or severe distress, the prevalence rate is 1.6%; when\nfrequency of symptoms is a minimum of one time per week, the prevalence rate is 4.5%.\nFemales are 1.5–2 times more likely than males to have RLS. RLS also increases with age.\nThe prevalence of RLS may be lower in Asian populations. \nDevelopment and Course\nThe onset of RLS typically occurs in the second or third decade. Approximately 40% of in-\ndividuals diagnosed with RLS during adulthood report having experienced symptoms\nbefore age 20 years, and 20% report having experienced symptoms before age 10 years.\nPrevalence rates of RLS increase steadily with age until about age 60 years, with symptoms\nremaining stable or decreasing slightly in older age groups. Compared with nonfamilial\ncases, familial RLS usually has a younger age at onset and a slower progressive course. The\nclinical course of RLS differs by age at onset. When onset occurs before age 45, there is of-\nten a slow progression of symptoms. In late-onset RLS, rapid progression is typical, and\naggravating factors are common. Symptoms of RLS appear similar across the lifespan, re-\nmaining stable or decreasing slightly in older age groups.\nDiagnosis of RLS in children can be difficult because of the self-report component.\nWhile Criterion A for adults assumes that the description of “urge to move” is by the pa-\ntient, pediatric diagnosis requires a description in the child’s own words rather than by a\nparent or caretaker. Typically children age 6 years or older are able to provide detailed, ad-\nequate descriptors of RLS. However, children rarely use or understand the word “urge,”\nreporting instead that their legs “have to” or “got to” move. Also, potentially related to\nprolonged periods of sitting during class, two-thirds of children and adolescents report\ndaytime leg sensations. Thus, for diagnostic Criterion A3, it is important to compare equal\n412\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nduration of sitting or lying down in the day to sitting or lying down in the evening or night.\nNocturnal worsening tends to persist even in the context of pediatric RLS. As with RLS in\nadults, there is a significant negative impact on sleep, mood, cognition, and function. Im-\npairment in children and adolescents is manifested more often in behavioral and educa-\ntional domains. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nGenetic and physiological.\nPredisposing factors include female gender, advancing\nage, genetic risk variants, and family history of RLS. Precipitating factors are often time-\nlimited, such as iron deficiency, with most individuals resuming normal sleep patterns\nafter the initial triggering event has disappeared. Genetic risk variants also play a role in\nRLS secondary to such disorders as uremia, suggesting that individuals with a genetic sus-\nceptibility develop RLS in the presence of further risk factors. RLS has a strong familial\ncomponent. \nThere are defined pathophysiological pathways subserving RLS. Genome-wide asso-\nciation studies have found that RLS is significantly associated with common genetic vari-\nants in intronic or intergenic regions in MEIS1, BTBD9, and MAP2K5 on chromosomes 2p,\n6p, and 15q, respectively. The association of these three variants with RLS has been inde-\npendently replicated. BTBD9 confers a very large (80%) excessive risk when even a single\nallele is present. Because of the high frequency of this variant in individuals of European\ndescent, the population attributable risk (PAR) approximates 50%. At-risk alleles associ-\nated with MEIS1 and BTBD9 are less common in individuals of African or Asian descent,\nperhaps suggesting lower risk for RLS in these populations. \nPathophysiological mechanisms in RLS also include disturbances in the central dopa-\nminergic system and disturbances in iron metabolism. The endogenous opiate system\nmay also be involved. Treatment effects of dopaminergic drugs (primarily D2 and D3 non-\nergot agonists) provide further support that RLS is grounded in dysfunctional central\ndopaminergic pathways. While the effective treatment of RLS has also been shown to sig-\nnificantly reduce depressive symptoms, serotonergic antidepressants can induce or aggra-\nvate RLS in some individuals. \nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nAlthough RLS is more prevalent in females than in males, there are no diagnostic differ-\nences according to gender. However, the prevalence of RLS during pregnancy is two to\nthree times greater than in the general population. RLS associated with pregnancy peaks\nduring the third trimester and improves or resolves in most cases soon after delivery. The\ngender difference in prevalence of RLS is explained at least in part by parity, with nullipa-\nrous females being at the same risk of RLS as age-matched males.\nDiagnostic Markers\nPolysomnography demonstrates significant abnormalities in RLS, commonly increased\nlatency to sleep, and higher arousal index. Polysomnography with a preceding immobili-\nzation test may provide an indicator of the motor sign of RLS, periodic limb movements,\nunder standard conditions of sleep and during quiet resting, both of which can provoke RLS\nsymptoms.\nFunctional Consequences of Restless Legs Syndrome\nForms of RLS severe enough to significantly impair functioning or associated with mental dis-\norders, including depression and anxiety, occur in approximately 2%–3% of the population. \nAlthough the impact of milder symptoms is less well characterized, individuals with\nRLS complain of disruption in at least one activity of daily living, with up to 50% reporting\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder\n413\na negative impact on mood, and 47.6% reporting a lack of energy. The most common conse-\nquences of RLS are sleep disturbance, including reduced sleep time, sleep fragmentation,\nand overall disturbance; depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and post-\ntraumatic stress disorder; and quality-of-life impairments. RLS can result in daytime sleep-\niness or fatigue and is frequently accompanied by significant distress or impairment in\naffective, social, occupational, educational, academic, behavioral, or cognitive functioning. \nDifferential Diagnosis \nThe most important conditions in the differential diagnosis of RLS are leg cramps, posi-\ntional discomfort, arthralgias/arthritis, myalgias, positional ischemia (numbness), leg\nedema, peripheral neuropathy, radiculopathy, and habitual foot tapping. “Knotting” of\nthe muscle (cramps), relief with a single postural shift, limitation to joints, soreness to pal-\npation (myalgias), and other abnormalities on physical examination are not characteristic\nof RLS. Unlike RLS, nocturnal leg cramps do not typically present with the desire to move\nthe limbs nor are there frequent limb movements. Less common conditions to be differen-\ntiated from RLS include neuroleptic-induced akathisia, myelopathy, symptomatic venous\ninsufficiency, peripheral artery disease, eczema, other orthopedic problems, and anxiety-\ninduced restlessness. Worsening at night and periodic limb movements are more common\nin RLS than in medication-induced akathisia or peripheral neuropathy. \nWhile is it important that RLS symptoms not be solely accounted for by another medical\nor behavioral condition, it should also be appreciated that any of these similar conditions can\noccur in an individual with RLS. This necessitates a separate focus on each possible condi-\ntion in the diagnostic process and when assessing impact. For cases in which the diagnosis of\nRLS is not certain, evaluation for the supportive features of RLS, particularly PLMS or a fam-\nily history of RLS, may be helpful. Clinical features, such as response to a dopaminergic\nagent and positive family history for RLS, can help with the differential diagnosis.\nComorbidity\nDepressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and attentional disorders are commonly comor-\nbid with RLS and are discussed in the section “Functional Consequences of Restless Legs\nSyndrome.” The main medical disorder comorbid with RLS is cardiovascular disease.\nThere may be an association with numerous other medical disorders, including hyperten-\nsion, narcolepsy, migraine, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, peripheral neuropathy,\nobstructive sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, fibromyalgia, osteoporosis, obesity, thyroid\ndisease, and cancer. Iron deficiency, pregnancy, and chronic renal failure are also comor-\nbid with RLS.\nRelationship to International Classification of \nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), presents similar diag-\nnostic criteria for RLS but does not contain a criterion specifying frequency or duration of\nsymptoms.", "provenance": {"source_file": "sleep_wake_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 11, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.546322"}}

Such evidence of an independent sleep disorder could include\nthe following:\nThe symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms\npersist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of\nacute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the\nexistence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced sleep disorder\n(e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes).\nD. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.\nE. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning.\nNote: This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or\nsubstance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical\npicture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.\nCoding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medica-\ntion]-induced sleep disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM\ncode depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for\nthe same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the sub-\nstance-induced sleep disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should\nrecord “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced sleep disorder (e.g.,\n“mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced sleep disorder”). If a moderate or severe\nsubstance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sleep disorder, the 4th po-\nsition character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder”\nor “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance\nuse disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy\nuse of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record\nonly the substance-induced sleep disorder. A moderate or severe tobacco use disorder is\nrequired in order to code a tobacco-induced sleep disorder; it is not permissible to code a\ncomorbid mild tobacco use disorder or no tobacco use disorder with a tobacco-induced\nsleep disorder.\nSpecify whether:\nInsomnia type: Characterized by difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep, frequent\nnocturnal awakenings, or nonrestorative sleep.\nDaytime sleepiness type: Characterized by predominant complaint of excessive\nsleepiness/fatigue during waking hours or, less commonly, a long sleep period.\nParasomnia type: Characterized by abnormal behavioral events during sleep.\nMixed type: Characterized by a substance/medication-induced sleep problem charac-\nterized by multiple types of sleep symptoms, but no symptom clearly predominates.\nSpecify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders” for di-\nagnoses associated with substance class):\nWith onset during intoxication: This specifier should be used if criteria are met for\nintoxication with the substance/medication and symptoms developed during the intox-\nication period.\nWith onset during discontinuation/withdrawal: This specifier should be used if cri-\nteria are met for discontinuation/withdrawal from the substance/medication and symp-\ntoms developed during, or shortly after, discontinuation of the substance/medication.\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder\n415\nRecording Procedures\nICD-9-CM.\nThe name of the substance/medication-induced sleep disorder begins with\nthe specific substance (e.g., cocaine, bupropion) that is presumed to be causing the sleep\ndisturbance. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set,\nwhich is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g.,\nbupropion), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a sub-\nstance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown,\nthe category “unknown substance” should be used.\nThe name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during in-\ntoxication, onset during discontinuation/withdrawal), followed by the subtype designa-\ntion (i.e., insomnia type, daytime sleepiness type, parasomnia type, mixed type). Unlike\nthe recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance-induced disorder\nand substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code\nis given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of insomnia occurring\nduring withdrawal in a man with a severe lorazepam use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.85\nlorazepam-induced sleep disorder, with onset during withdrawal, insomnia type. An ad-\nditional diagnosis of 304.10 severe lorazepam use disorder is also given. When more than\none substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of the sleep distur-\nbance, each should be listed separately (e.g., 292.85 alcohol-induced sleep disorder, with\nonset during intoxication, insomnia type; 292.85 cocaine-induced sleep disorder, with on-\nset during intoxication, insomnia type). \nICD-10-CM.\nThe name of the substance/medication-induced sleep disorder begins with the\nspecific substance (e.g., cocaine, bupropion) that is presumed to be causing the sleep distur-\nbance.

For sub-\nstances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., bupropion), the code for “other substance”\nshould be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the\nspecific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used.\nWhen recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any)\nis listed first, followed by the word “with,” followed by the name of the substance-induced\nsleep disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset\nICD-10-CM\nICD-9-CM\nWith use \ndisorder, \nmild\nWith use \ndisorder, \nmoderate \nor severe\nWithout \nuse \ndisorder\nAlcohol\n291.82\nF10.182\nF10.282\nF10.982\nCaffeine\n292.85\nF15.182\nF15.282\nF15.982\nCannabis\n292.85\nF12.188\nF12.288\nF12.988\nOpioid\n292.85\nF11.182\nF11.282\nF11.982\nSedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic\n292.85\nF13.182\nF13.282\nF13.982\nAmphetamine (or other \nstimulant)\n292.85\nF15.182\nF15.282\nF15.982\nCocaine\n292.85\nF14.182\nF14.282\nF14.982\nTobacco\n292.85\nNA\nF17.208\nNA\nOther (or unknown) substance\n292.85\nF19.182\nF19.282\nF19.982\n416\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nduring discontinuation/withdrawal), followed by the subtype designation (i.e., insomnia\ntype, daytime sleepiness type, parasomnia type, mixed type). For example, in the case of\ninsomnia occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe lorazepam use disorder, the\ndiagnosis is F13.282 severe lorazepam use disorder with lorazepam-induced sleep disor-\nder, with onset during withdrawal, insomnia type. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid\nsevere lorazepam use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced sleep disorder occurs\nwithout a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., with medication use), no accompanying\nsubstance use disorder is noted (e.g., F19.982 bupropion-induced sleep disorder, with on-\nset during medication use, insomnia type). When more than one substance is judged to\nplay a significant role in the development of the sleep disturbance, each should be listed\nseparately (e.g., F10.282 severe alcohol use disorder with alcohol-induced sleep disorder,\nwith onset during intoxication, insomnia type; F14.282 severe cocaine use disorder with\ncocaine-induced sleep disorder, with onset during intoxication, insomnia type).\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of substance/medication-induced sleep disorder is a prominent sleep\ndisturbance that is sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention (Criterion A)\nand that is judged to be primarily associated with the pharmacological effects of a substance\n(i.e., a drug of abuse, a medication, toxin exposure) (Criterion B). Depending on the sub-\nstance involved, one of four types of sleep disturbances is reported. Insomnia type and day-\ntime sleepiness type are most common, while parasomnia type is seen less often. The mixed\ntype is noted when more than one type of sleep disturbance–related symptom is present and\nnone predominates. The disturbance must not be better explained by another sleep disorder\n(Criterion C). A substance/medication-induced sleep disorder is distinguished from insom-\nnia disorder or a disorder associated with excessive daytime sleepiness by considering onset\nand course. For drugs of abuse, there must be evidence of intoxication or withdrawal from\nthe history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. Substance/medication-induced\nsleep disorder arises only in association with intoxication or discontinuation/withdrawal\nstates, whereas other sleep disorders may precede the onset of substance use or occur during\ntimes of sustained abstinence. As discontinuation/withdrawal states for some substances\ncan be protracted, onset of the sleep disturbance can occur 4 weeks after cessation of sub-\nstance use, and the disturbance may have features atypical of other sleep disorders (e.g.,\natypical age at onset or course). The diagnosis is not made if the sleep disturbance occurs\nonly during a delirium (Criterion D). The symptoms must cause clinically significant dis-\ntress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Crite-\nrion E). This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or\nsubstance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical\npicture and when the symptoms warrant independent clinical attention. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nDuring periods of substance/medication use, intoxication, or withdrawal, individuals fre-\nquently complain of dysphoric mood, including depression and anxiety, irritability, cog-\nnitive impairment, inability to concentrate, and fatigue. \nProminent and severe sleep disturbances can occur in association with intoxication\nwith the following classes of substances: alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; opioids; sedatives,\nhypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulants (including cocaine); and other (or unknown) sub-\nstances. Prominent and severe sleep disturbances can occur in association with withdrawal\nfrom the following classes of substances: alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; opioids; sedatives,\nhypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulant (including cocaine); tobacco; and other (or unknown)\nsubstances. Some medications that invoke sleep disturbances include adrenergic agonists\nand antagonists, dopamine agonists and antagonists, cholinergic agonists and antagonists,\nserotonergic agonists and antagonists, antihistamines, and corticosteroids.\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder\n417\nAlcohol.\nAlcohol-induced sleep disorder typically occurs as insomnia type. During\nacute intoxication, alcohol produces an immediate sedative effect depending on dose, ac-\ncompanied by increased stages 3 and 4 non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and re-\nduced rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Following these initial effects, there may be\nincreased wakefulness, restless sleep, and vivid and anxiety-laden dreams for the remain-\ning sleep period. In parallel, stages 3 and 4 sleep are reduced, and wakefulness and REM\nsleep are increased. Alcohol can aggravate breathing-related sleep disorder. With habitual\nuse, alcohol continues to show a short-lived sedative effect in the first half of the night, fol-\nlowed by sleep continuity disruption in the second half. During alcohol withdrawal, there\nis extremely disrupted sleep continuity, and an increased amount and intensity of REM\nsleep, associated frequently with vivid dreaming, which in extreme form, constitutes part\nof alcohol withdrawal delirium. After acute withdrawal, chronic alcohol users may con-\ntinue to complain of light, fragmented sleep for weeks to years associated with a persistent\ndeficit in slow-wave sleep.\nCaffeine.\nCaffeine-induced sleep disorder produces insomnia in a dose-dependent man-\nner, with some individuals presenting with daytime sleepiness related to withdrawal. \nCannabis.\nAcute administration of cannabis may shorten sleep latency, though arous-\ning effects with increments in sleep latency also occur. Cannabis enhances slow-wave\nsleep and suppresses REM sleep after acute administration. In chronic users, tolerance to\nthe sleep-inducing and slow-wave sleep–enhancing effects develops. Upon withdrawal,\nsleep difficulties and unpleasant dreams have been reported lasting for several weeks.\nPolysomnography studies demonstrate reduced slow-wave sleep and increased REM sleep\nduring this phase.\nOpioids.\nOpioids may produce an increase in sleepiness and in subjective depth of sleep,\nand reduced REM sleep, during acute short-term use. With continued administration, tol-\nerance to the sedative effects of opioids develops and there are complaints of insomnia.\nConsistent with their respiratory depressant effects, opioids exacerbate sleep apnea.\nSedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances.\nSedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics (e.g.,\nbarbiturates, benzodiazepines receptor agonists, meprobamate, glutethimide, methypry-\nlon) have similar effects as opioids on sleep. During acute intoxication, sedative-hypnotic\ndrugs produce the expected increase in sleepiness and decrease in wakefulness. Chronic\nuse (particularly of barbiturates and the older nonbarbiturate, nonbenzodiazepine drugs)\nmay cause tolerance with subsequent return of insomnia. Daytime sleepiness may occur.\nSedative-hypnotic drugs can increase the frequency and severity of obstructive sleep ap-\nnea events. Parasomnias are associated with use of benzodiazepine receptor agonists, es-\npecially when these medications are taken at higher doses and when they are combined\nwith other sedative drugs. Abrupt discontinuation of chronic sedative, hypnotic, or anx-\niolytic use can lead to withdrawal but more commonly rebound insomnia, a condition of\nan exacerbation of insomnia upon drug discontinuation for 1–2 days reported to occur\neven with short-term use. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drugs with short durations of\naction are most likely to produce complaints of rebound insomnia, whereas those with\nlonger durations of action are more often associated with daytime sleepiness. Any sedative,\nhypnotic, or anxiolytic drug can potentially cause daytime sedation, withdrawal, or re-\nbound insomnia. \nAmphetamines and related substances and other stimulants.\nSleep disorders induced\nby amphetamine and related substances and other stimulants are characterized by insomnia\nduring intoxication and excessive sleepiness during withdrawal. During acute intoxication,\nstimulants reduce the total amount of sleep, increase sleep latency and sleep continuity distur-\nbances, and decrease REM sleep. Slow-wave sleep tends to be reduced. During withdrawal\nfrom chronic stimulant use, there is both prolonged nocturnal sleep duration and excessive\ndaytime sleepiness. Multiple sleep latency tests may show increased daytime sleepiness dur-\n418\nSleep-Wake Disorders\ning the withdrawal phase. Drugs like 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; “ec-\nstasy”) and related substances lead to restless and disturbed sleep within 48 hours of intake;\nfrequent use of these compounds is associated with persisting symptoms of anxiety, depres-\nsion, and sleep disturbances, even during longer-term abstinence.\nTobacco.\nChronic tobacco consumption is associated primarily with symptoms of insom-\nnia, decreased slow-wave sleep with a reduction of sleep efficiency, and increased daytime\nsleepiness. Withdrawal from tobacco can lead to impaired sleep. Individuals who smoke\nheavily may experience regular nocturnal awakenings caused by tobacco craving.\nOther or unknown substances/medications.\nOther substances/medications may pro-\nduce sleep disturbances, particularly medications that affect the central or autonomic\nnervous systems (e.g., adrenergic agonists and antagonists, dopamine agonists and antag-\nonists, cholinergic agonists and antagonists, serotonergic agonists and antagonists, anti-\nhistamines, corticosteroids). \nDevelopment and Course\nInsomnia in children can be identified by either a parent or the child. Often the child has a\nclear sleep disturbance associated with initiation of a medication but may not report\nsymptoms, although parents observe the sleep disturbances. The use of some illicit sub-\nstances (e.g., cannabis, ecstasy) is prevalent in adolescence and early adulthood. Insomnia\nor any other sleep disturbance encountered in this age group should prompt careful con-\nsideration of whether the sleep disturbance is due to consumption of these substances.\nHelp-seeking behavior for the sleep disturbance in these age groups is limited, and thus\ncorroborative report may be elicited from a parent, caregiver, or teacher. Older individuals\ntake more medications and are at increased risk for developing a substance/medication-\ninduced sleep disorder. They may interpret sleep disturbance as part of normal aging and\nfail to report symptoms. Individuals with major neurocognitive disorder (e.g., dementia)\nare at risk for substance/medication-induced sleep disorders but may not report symp-\ntoms, making corroborative report from caregiver(s) particularly important.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nRisk and prognostic factors involved in substance abuse/dependence or medication use\nare normative for certain age groups. They are relevant for, and likely applicable to, the\ntype of sleep disturbance encountered (see the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive\nDisorders” for descriptions of respective substance use disorders).\nTemperamental.\nSubstance use generally precipitates or accompanies insomnia in vul-\nnerable individuals. Thus, presence of insomnia in response to stress or change in sleep en-\nvironment or timing can represent a risk for developing substance/medication-induced\nsleep disorder. A similar risk may be present for individuals with other sleep disorders\n(e.g., individuals with hypersomnia who use stimulants).\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nThe consumption of substances, including prescribed medications, may depend in part on\ncultural background and specific local drug regulations. \nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nGender-specific prevalences (i.e., females affected more than males at a ratio of about 2:1) exist\nfor patterns of consumption of some substances (e.g., alcohol). The same amount and duration\nof consumption of a given substance may lead to highly different sleep-related outcomes in\nmales and females based on, for example, gender-specific differences in hepatic functioning.\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder\n419\nDiagnostic Markers\nEach of the substance/medication-induced sleep disorders produces electroencephalo-\ngraphic sleep patterns that are associated with, but cannot be considered diagnostic of, other\ndisorders. The electroencephalographic sleep profile for each substance is related to the\nstage of use, whether intake/intoxication, chronic use, or withdrawal following discontinu-\nation of the substance. All-night polysomnography can help define the severity of insomnia\ncomplaints, while the multiple sleep latency test provides information about the severity of\ndaytime sleepiness. Monitoring of nocturnal respiration and periodic limb movements with\npolysomnography may verify a substance’s impact on nocturnal breathing and motor be-\nhavior. Sleep diaries for 2 weeks and actigraphy are considered helpful in confirming the\npresence of substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. Drug screening can be of use\nwhen the individual is not aware or unwilling to relate information about substance intake.\nFunctional Consequences of \nSubstance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder\nWhile there are many functional consequences associated with sleep disorders, the only\nunique consequence for substance/medication-induced sleep disorder is increased risk\nfor relapse. The degree of sleep disturbance during alcohol withdrawal (e.g., REM sleep\nrebound predicts risk of relapse of drinking). Monitoring of sleep quality and daytime\nsleepiness during and after withdrawal may provide clinically meaningful information on\nwhether an individual is at increased risk for relapse.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nSubstance intoxication or substance withdrawal. Sleep disturbances are commonly en-\ncountered in the context of substance intoxication or substance discontinuation/with-\ndrawal. A diagnosis of substance/medication-induced sleep disorder should be made\ninstead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the\nsleep disturbance is predominant in the clinical picture and is sufficiently severe to war-\nrant independent clinical attention. \nDelirium.\nIf the substance/medication-induced sleep disturbance occurs exclusively dur-\ning the course of a delirium, it is not diagnosed separately. \nOther sleep disorders.\nA substance/medication-induced sleep disorder is distinguished\nfrom another sleep disorder if a substance/medication is judged to be etiologically related to\nthe symptoms. A substance/medication-induced sleep disorder attributed to a prescribed\nmedication for a mental disorder or medical condition must have its onset while the individual\nis receiving the medication or during discontinuation, if there is a discontinuation/with-\ndrawal syndrome associated with the medication. Once treatment is discontinued, the sleep\ndisturbance will usually remit within days to several weeks. If symptoms persist beyond\n4 weeks, other causes for the sleep disturbance–related symptoms should be considered. Not\ninfrequently, individuals with another sleep disorder use medications or drugs of abuse to\nself-medicate their symptoms (e.g., alcohol for management of insomnia). If the substance/\nmedication is judged to play a significant role in the exacerbation of the sleep disturbance, an\nadditional diagnosis of a substance/medication-induced sleep disorder may be warranted. \nSleep disorder due to another medical condition.\nSubstance/medication-induced sleep\ndisorder and sleep disorder associated with another medical condition may produce sim-\nilar symptoms of insomnia, daytime sleepiness, or a parasomnia. Many individuals with\nother medical conditions that cause sleep disturbance are treated with medications that\nmay also cause sleep disturbances. The chronology of symptoms is the most important fac-\ntor in distinguishing between these two sources of sleep symptoms. Difficulties with sleep\nthat clearly preceded the use of any medication for treatment of a medical condition would\n420\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nsuggest a diagnosis of sleep disorder associated with another medical condition. Con-\nversely, sleep symptoms that appear only after the initiation of a particular medication/\nsubstance suggest a substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. If the disturbance is\ncomorbid with another medical condition and is also exacerbated by substance use, both\ndiagnoses (i.e., sleep disorder associated with another medical condition and substance/\nmedication-induced sleep disorder) are given. When there is insufficient evidence to de-\ntermine whether the sleep disturbance is attributable to a substance/medication or to an-\nother medical condition or is primary (i.e., not due to either a substance/medication or\nanother medical condition), a diagnosis of other specified sleep-wake disorder or unspec-\nified sleep-wake disorder is indicated.\nComorbidity\nSee the “Comorbidity” sections for other sleep disorders in this chapter, including insom-\nnia, hypersomnolence, central sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoventilation, and circadian\nrhythm sleep-wake disorders, shift work type.\nRelationship to International Classification of \nSleep Disorders\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), lists sleep disorders\n“due to drug or substance” under their respective phenotypes (e.g., insomnia, hypersomnia).", "provenance": {"source_file": "sleep_wake_disorders_dsm5_output.jsonl", "line_no": 12, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T22:42:43.546322"}}
