The essential feature is absent or grossly underdeveloped at-\ntachment between the child and putative caregiving adults. Children with reactive attach-\nment disorder are believed to have the capacity to form selective attachments. However,\nbecause of limited opportunities during early development, they fail to show the behavioral\nmanifestations of selective attachments. That is, when distressed, they show no consistent\neffort to obtain comfort, support, nurturance, or protection from caregivers. Furthermore,\nwhen distressed, children with this disorder do not respond more than minimally to com-\nforting efforts of caregivers. Thus, the disorder is associated with the absence of expected\ncomfort seeking and response to comforting behaviors. As such, children with reactive\nattachment disorder show diminished or absent expression of positive emotions during\nroutine interactions with caregivers. In addition, their emotion regulation capacity is com-\npromised, and they display episodes of negative emotions of fear, sadness, or irritability\nthat are not readily explained. A diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder should not be\nmade in children who are developmentally unable to form selective attachments. For this\nreason, the child must have a developmental age of at least 9 months.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nBecause of the shared etiological association with social neglect, reactive attachment dis-\norder often co-occurs with developmental delays, especially in delays in cognition and\nlanguage. Other associated features include stereotypies and other signs of severe neglect\n(e.g., malnutrition or signs of poor care). \nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of reactive attachment disorder is unknown, but the disorder is seen rela-\ntively rarely in clinical settings. The disorder has been found in young children exposed to\nsevere neglect before being placed in foster care or raised in institutions. However, even in\npopulations of severely neglected children, the disorder is uncommon, occurring in less\nthan 10% of such children.\nReactive Attachment Disorder\n267\nDevelopment and Course\nConditions of social neglect are often present in the first months of life in children diag-\nnosed with reactive attachment disorder, even before the disorder is diagnosed. The clin-\nical features of the disorder manifest in a similar fashion between the ages of 9 months and\n5 years. That is, signs of absent-to-minimal attachment behaviors and associated emotion-\nally aberrant behaviors are evident in children throughout this age range, although differ-\ning cognitive and motor abilities may affect how these behaviors are expressed. Without\nremediation and recovery through normative caregiving environments, it appears that signs\nof the disorder may persist, at least for several years.\nIt is unclear whether reactive attachment disorder occurs in older children and, if so, how\nit differs from its presentation in young children. Because of this, the diagnosis should be\nmade with caution in children older than 5 years.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nEnvironmental.\nSerious social neglect is a diagnostic requirement for reactive attach-\nment disorder and is also the only known risk factor for the disorder. However, the ma-\njority of severely neglected children do not develop the disorder. Prognosis appears to\ndepend on the quality of the caregiving environment following serious neglect. \nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nSimilar attachment behaviors have been described in young children in many different\ncultures around the world. However, caution should be exercised in making the diagnosis\nof reactive attachment disorder in cultures in which attachment has not been studied.\nFunctional Consequences of \nReactive Attachment Disorder\nReactive attachment disorder significantly impairs young children’s abilities to relate in-\nterpersonally to adults or peers and is associated with functional impairment across many\ndomains of early childhood.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nAutism spectrum disorder.\nAberrant social behaviors manifest in young children with\nreactive attachment disorder, but they also are key features of autism spectrum disorder.\nSpecifically, young children with either condition can manifest dampened expression of\npositive emotions, cognitive and language delays, and impairments in social reciprocity.\nAs a result, reactive attachment disorder must be differentiated from autism spectrum dis-\norder. These two disorders can be distinguished based on differential histories of neglect\nand on the presence of restricted interests or ritualized behaviors, specific deficit in social\ncommunication, and selective attachment behaviors. Children with reactive attachment\ndisorder have experienced a history of severe social neglect, although it is not always pos-\nsible to obtain detailed histories about the precise nature of their experiences, especially in\ninitial evaluations. Children with autistic spectrum disorder will only rarely have a history\nof social neglect. The restricted interests and repetitive behaviors characteristic of autism\nspectrum disorder are not a feature of reactive attachment disorder. These clinical features\nmanifest as excessive adherence to rituals and routines; restricted, fixated interests; and\nunusual sensory reactions. However, it is important to note that children with either con-\ndition can exhibit stereotypic behaviors such as rocking or flapping. Children with either\ndisorder also may exhibit a range of intellectual functioning, but only children with autis-\n268\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\ntic spectrum disorder exhibit selective impairments in social communicative behaviors,\nsuch as intentional communication (i.e., impairment in communication that is deliberate,\ngoal-directed, and aimed at influencing the behavior of the recipient). Children with reac-\ntive attachment disorder show social communicative functioning comparable to their\noverall level of intellectual functioning. Finally, children with autistic spectrum disorder\nregularly show attachment behavior typical for their developmental level. In contrast,\nchildren with reactive attachment disorder do so only rarely or inconsistently, if at all.\nIntellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).\nDevelopmental delays of-\nten accompany reactive attachment disorder, but they should not be confused with the\ndisorder. Children with intellectual disability should exhibit social and emotional skills\ncomparable to their cognitive skills and do not demonstrate the profound reduction in\npositive affect and emotion regulation difficulties evident in children with reactive attach-\nment disorder. In addition, developmentally delayed children who have reached a cogni-\ntive age of 7–9 months should demonstrate selective attachments regardless of their\nchronological age. In contrast, children with reactive attachment disorder show lack of\npreferred attachment despite having attained a developmental age of at least 9 months.\nDepressive disorders.\nDepression in young children is also associated with reductions\nin positive affect. There is limited evidence, however, to suggest that children with depres-\nsive disorders have impairments in attachment. That is, young children who have been di-\nagnosed with depressive disorders still should seek and respond to comforting efforts by\ncaregivers.\nComorbidity\nConditions associated with neglect, including cognitive delays, language delays, and ste-\nreotypies, often co-occur with reactive attachment disorder. Medical conditions, such as\nsevere malnutrition, may accompany signs of the disorder. Depressive symptoms also\nmay co-occur with reactive attachment disorder."}

This overly familiar behavior violates the social boundaries of the culture. A\ndiagnosis of disinhibited social engagement disorder should not be made before children\nare developmentally able to form selective attachments. For this reason, the child must\nhave a developmental age of at least 9 months.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nBecause of the shared etiological association with social neglect, disinhibited social en-\ngagement disorder may co-occur with developmental delays, especially cognitive and lan-\nguage delays, stereotypies, and other signs of severe neglect, such as malnutrition or poor\ncare. However, signs of the disorder often persist even after these other signs of neglect are\nno longer present. Therefore, it is not uncommon for children with the disorder to present\nwith no current signs of neglect. Moreover, the condition can present in children who\nshow no signs of disordered attachment. Thus, disinhibited social engagement disorder\nmay be seen in children with a history of neglect who lack attachments or whose attach-\nments to their caregivers range from disturbed to secure. \nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of disinhibited social attachment disorder is unknown. Nevertheless, the\ndisorder appears to be rare, occurring in a minority of children, even those who have been\nseverely neglected and subsequently placed in foster care or raised in institutions. In such\nhigh-risk populations, the condition occurs in only about 20% of children. The condition is\nseen rarely in other clinical settings. \nDevelopment and Course\nConditions of social neglect are often present in the first months of life in children diag-\nnosed with disinhibited social engagement disorder, even before the disorder is diag-\nnosed. However, there is no evidence that neglect beginning after age 2 years is associated\nwith manifestations of the disorder. If neglect occurs early and signs of the disorder\nappear, clinical features of the disorder are moderately stable over time, particularly if\nconditions of neglect persist. Indiscriminate social behavior and lack of reticence with un-\nfamiliar adults in toddlerhood are accompanied by attention-seeking behaviors in pre-\nschoolers. When the disorder persists into middle childhood, clinical features manifest as\nverbal and physical overfamiliarity as well as inauthentic expression of emotions. These\nsigns appear particularly apparent when the child interacts with adults. Peer relationships\nare most affected in adolescence, with both indiscriminate behavior and conflicts appar-\nent. The disorder has not been described in adults.\n270\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\nDisinhibited social engagement disorder has been described from the second year of\nlife through adolescence. There are some differences in manifestations of the disorder\nfrom early childhood through adolescence. At the youngest ages, across many cultures,\nchildren show reticence when interacting with strangers. Young children with the disorder\nfail to show reticence to approach, engage with, and even accompany adults. In preschool\nchildren, verbal and social intrusiveness appear most prominent, often accompanied by\nattention-seeking behavior. Verbal and physical overfamiliarity continue through middle\nchildhood, accompanied by inauthentic expressions of emotion. In adolescence, indis-\ncriminate behavior extends to peers. Relative to healthy adolescents, adolescents with the\ndisorder have more “superficial” peer relationships and more peer conflicts. Adult man-\nifestations of the disorder are unknown.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nEnvironmental.\nSerious social neglect is a diagnostic requirement for disinhibited social\nengagement disorder and is also the only known risk factor for the disorder. However, the\nmajority of severely neglected children do not develop the disorder. Neurobiological vul-\nnerability may differentiate neglected children who do and do not develop the disorder.\nHowever, no clear link with any specific neurobiological factors has been established. The\ndisorder has not been identified in children who experience social neglect only after age\n2 years. Prognosis is only modestly associated with quality of the caregiving environment\nfollowing serious neglect. In many cases, the disorder persists, even in children whose\ncaregiving environment becomes markedly improved.\nCourse modifiers.\nCaregiving quality seems to moderate the course of disinhibited so-\ncial engagement disorder. Nevertheless, even after placement in normative caregiving\nenvironments, some children show persistent signs of the disorder, at least through ado-\nlescence. \nFunctional Consequences of \nDisinhibited Social Engagement Disorder\nDisinhibited social engagement disorder significantly impairs young children’s abilities to\nrelate interpersonally to adults and peers.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nAttention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder.\nBecause of social impulsivity that sometimes\naccompanies attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), it is necessary to differ-\nentiate the two disorders. Children with disinhibited social engagement disorder may be\ndistinguished from those with ADHD because the former do not show difficulties with at-\ntention or hyperactivity. \nComorbidity\nLimited research has examined the issue of disorders comorbid with disinhibited social\nengagement disorder. Conditions associated with neglect, including cognitive delays,\nlanguage delays, and stereotypies, may co-occur with disinhibited social engagement dis-\norder. In addition, children may be diagnosed with ADHD and disinhibited social engage-\nment disorder concurrently. \nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder\n271"}

Emotional re-\nactions to the traumatic event (e.g., fear, helplessness, horror) are no longer a part of\nCriterion A. The clinical presentation of PTSD varies. In some individuals, fear-based re-\nexperiencing, emotional, and behavioral symptoms may predominate. In others, anhe-\ndonic or dysphoric mood states and negative cognitions may be most distressing. In some\nother individuals, arousal and reactive-externalizing symptoms are prominent, while in\nothers, dissociative symptoms predominate. Finally, some individuals exhibit combina-\ntions of these symptom patterns. \nThe directly experienced traumatic events in Criterion A include, but are not limited\nto, exposure to war as a combatant or civilian, threatened or actual physical assault (e.g.,\nphysical attack, robbery, mugging, childhood physical abuse), threatened or actual sexual\nviolence (e.g., forced sexual penetration, alcohol\/drug-facilitated sexual penetration, abu-\nsive sexual contact, noncontact sexual abuse, sexual trafficking), being kidnapped, being\ntaken hostage, terrorist attack, torture, incarceration as a prisoner of war, natural or hu-\nman-made disasters, and severe motor vehicle accidents. For children, sexually violent\nevents may include developmentally inappropriate sexual experiences without physical\nviolence or injury. A life-threatening illness or debilitating medical condition is not neces-\nsarily considered a traumatic event. Medical incidents that qualify as traumatic events in-\nvolve sudden, catastrophic events (e.g., waking during surgery, anaphylactic shock).\nWitnessed events include, but are not limited to, observing threatened or serious injury,\nunnatural death, physical or sexual abuse of another person due to violent assault, domes-\ntic violence, accident, war or disaster, or a medical catastrophe in one’s child (e.g., a life-\nthreatening hemorrhage). Indirect exposure through learning about an event is limited to\nexperiences affecting close relatives or friends and experiences that are violent or acciden-\ntal (e.g., death due to natural causes does not qualify). Such events include violent per-\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder\n275\nsonal assault, suicide, serious accident, and serious injury. The disorder may be especially\nsevere or long-lasting when the stressor is interpersonal and intentional (e.g., torture, sex-\nual violence). \nThe traumatic event can be reexperienced in various ways. Commonly, the individual\nhas recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive recollections of the event (Criterion B1). Intrusive\nrecollections in PTSD are distinguished from depressive rumination in that they apply\nonly to involuntary and intrusive distressing memories. The emphasis is on recurrent\nmemories of the event that usually include sensory, emotional, or physiological behavioral\ncomponents. A common reexperiencing symptom is distressing dreams that replay the\nevent itself or that are representative or thematically related to the major threats involved\nin the traumatic event (Criterion B2). The individual may experience dissociative states\nthat last from a few seconds to several hours or even days, during which components of\nthe event are relived and the individual behaves as if the event were occurring at that mo-\nment (Criterion B3). Such events occur on a continuum from brief visual or other sensory\nintrusions about part of the traumatic event without loss of reality orientation, to complete\nloss of awareness of present surroundings. These episodes, often referred to as “flash-\nbacks,” are typically brief but can be associated with prolonged distress and heightened\narousal. For young children, reenactment of events related to trauma may appear in play\nor in dissociative states. Intense psychological distress (Criterion B4) or physiological re-\nactivity (Criterion B5) often occurs when the individual is exposed to triggering events that\nresemble or symbolize an aspect of the traumatic event (e.g., windy days after a hurricane;\nseeing someone who resembles one’s perpetrator). The triggering cue could be a physical\nsensation (e.g., dizziness for survivors of head trauma; rapid heartbeat for a previously\ntraumatized child), particularly for individuals with highly somatic presentations.\nStimuli associated with the trauma are persistently (e.g., always or almost always)\navoided. The individual commonly makes deliberate efforts to avoid thoughts, memories,\nfeelings, or talking about the traumatic event (e.g., utilizing distraction techniques to avoid\ninternal reminders) (Criterion C1) and to avoid activities, objects, situations, or people\nwho arouse recollections of it (Criterion C2).\nNegative alterations in cognitions or mood associated with the event begin or worsen\nafter exposure to the event. These negative alterations can take various forms, including an\ninability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event; such amnesia is typically\ndue to dissociative amnesia and is not due to head injury, alcohol, or drugs (Criterion D1).\nAnother form is persistent (i.e., always or almost always) and exaggerated negative ex-\npectations regarding important aspects of life applied to oneself, others, or the future (e.g.,\n“I have always had bad judgment”; “People in authority can’t be trusted”) that may man-\nifest as a negative change in perceived identity since the trauma (e.g., “I can’t trust anyone\never again”; Criterion D2). Individuals with PTSD may have persistent erroneous cogni-\ntions about the causes of the traumatic event that lead them to blame themselves or others\n(e.g., “It’s all my fault that my uncle abused me”) (Criterion D3). A persistent negative\nmood state (e.g., fear, horror, anger, guilt, shame) either began or worsened after exposure\nto the event (Criterion D4). The individual may experience markedly diminished interest\nor participation in previously enjoyed activities (Criterion D5), feeling detached or es-\ntranged from other people (Criterion D6), or a persistent inability to feel positive emotions\n(especially happiness, joy, satisfaction, or emotions associated with intimacy, tenderness,\nand sexuality) (Criterion D7).\nIndividuals with PTSD may be quick tempered and may even engage in aggressive\nverbal and\/or physical behavior with little or no provocation (e.g., yelling at people, get-\nting into fights, destroying objects) (Criterion E1). They may also engage in reckless or self-\ndestructive behavior such as dangerous driving, excessive alcohol or drug use, or self-\ninjurious or suicidal behavior (Criterion E2).  PTSD is often characterized by a heightened\nsensitivity to potential threats, including those that are related to the traumatic experience\n(e.g., following a motor vehicle accident, being especially sensitive to the threat potentially\n276\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\ncaused by cars or trucks) and those not related to the traumatic event (e.g., being fearful of\nsuffering a heart attack) (Criterion E3). Individuals with PTSD may be very reactive to un-\nexpected stimuli, displaying a heightened startle response, or jumpiness, to loud noises or\nunexpected movements (e.g., jumping markedly in response to a telephone ringing) (Cri-\nterion E4). Concentration difficulties, including difficulty remembering daily events (e.g.,\nforgetting one’s telephone number) or attending to focused tasks (e.g., following a conver-\nsation for a sustained period of time), are commonly reported (Criterion E5). Problems\nwith sleep onset and maintenance are common and may be associated with nightmares\nand safety concerns or with generalized elevated arousal that interferes with adequate sleep\n(Criterion E6). Some individuals also experience persistent dissociative symptoms of de-\ntachment from their bodies (depersonalization) or the world around them (derealization);\nthis is reflected in the “with dissociative symptoms” specifier.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nDevelopmental regression, such as loss of language in young children, may occur. Audi-\ntory pseudo-hallucinations, such as having the sensory experience of hearing one’s\nthoughts spoken in one or more different voices, as well as paranoid ideation, can be pres-\nent. Following prolonged, repeated, and severe traumatic events (e.g., childhood abuse,\ntorture), the individual may additionally experience difficulties in regulating emotions or\nmaintaining stable interpersonal relationships, or dissociative symptoms. When the trau-\nmatic event produces violent death, symptoms of both problematic bereavement and PTSD\nmay be present. \nPrevalence\nIn the United States, projected lifetime risk for PTSD using DSM-IV criteria at age 75 years\nis 8.7%. Twelve-month prevalence among U.S. adults is about 3.5%. Lower estimates are\nseen in Europe and most Asian, African, and Latin American countries, clustering around\n0.5%–1.0%. Although different groups have different levels of exposure to traumatic\nevents, the conditional probability of developing PTSD following a similar level of expo-\nsure may also vary across cultural groups. Rates of PTSD are higher among veterans and\nothers whose vocation increases the risk of traumatic exposure (e.g., police, firefighters,\nemergency medical personnel). Highest rates (ranging from one-third to more than one-\nhalf of those exposed) are found among survivors of rape, military combat and captivity,\nand ethnically or politically motivated internment and genocide. The prevalence of PTSD\nmay vary across development; children and adolescents, including preschool children,\ngenerally have displayed lower prevalence following exposure to serious traumatic\nevents; however, this may be because previous criteria were insufficiently developmen-\ntally informed. The prevalence of full-threshold PTSD also appears to be lower among\nolder adults compared with the general population; there is evidence that subthreshold\npresentations are more common than full PTSD in later life and that these symptoms are\nassociated with substantial clinical impairment. Compared with U.S. non-Latino whites,\nhigher rates of PTSD have been reported among U.S. Latinos, African Americans, and\nAmerican Indians, and lower rates have been reported among Asian Americans, after ad-\njustment for traumatic exposure and demographic variables.\nDevelopment and Course\nPTSD can occur at any age, beginning after the first year of life. Symptoms usually begin\nwithin the first 3 months after the trauma, although there may be a delay of months, or\neven years, before criteria for the diagnosis are met. There is abundant evidence for what\nDSM-IV called “delayed onset” but is now called “delayed expression,” with the recogni-\ntion that some symptoms typically appear immediately and that the delay is in meeting\nfull criteria.\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder\n277\nFrequently, an individual’s reaction to a trauma initially meets criteria for acute stress\ndisorder in the immediate aftermath of the trauma. The symptoms of PTSD and the rela-\ntive predominance of different symptoms may vary over time. Duration of the symptoms\nalso varies, with complete recovery within 3 months occurring in approximately one-half\nof adults, while some individuals remain symptomatic for longer than 12 months and\nsometimes for more than 50 years. Symptom recurrence and intensification may occur in\nresponse to reminders of the original trauma, ongoing life stressors, or newly experienced\ntraumatic events. For older individuals, declining health, worsening cognitive function-\ning, and social isolation may exacerbate PTSD symptoms.\nThe clinical expression of reexperiencing can vary across development. Young children\nmay report new onset of frightening dreams without content specific to the traumatic event.\nBefore age 6 years (see criteria for preschool subtype), young children are more likely to ex-\npress reexperiencing symptoms through play that refers directly or symbolically to the\ntrauma. They may not manifest fearful reactions at the time of the exposure or during reex-\nperiencing. Parents may report a wide range of emotional or behavioral changes in young\nchildren. Children may focus on imagined interventions in their play or storytelling. In ad-\ndition to avoidance, children may become preoccupied with reminders. Because of young\nchildren’s limitations in expressing thoughts or labeling emotions, negative alterations in\nmood or cognition tend to involve primarily mood changes. Children may experience co-\noccurring traumas (e.g., physical abuse, witnessing domestic violence) and in chronic cir-\ncumstances may not be able to identify onset of symptomatology. Avoidant behavior may\nbe associated with restricted play or exploratory behavior in young children; reduced par-\nticipation in new activities in school-age children; or reluctance to pursue developmental op-\nportunities in adolescents (e.g., dating, driving). Older children and adolescents may judge\nthemselves as cowardly. Adolescents may harbor beliefs of being changed in ways that\nmake them socially undesirable and estrange them from peers (e.g., “Now I’ll never fit in”)\nand lose aspirations for the future. Irritable or aggressive behavior in children and adoles-\ncents can interfere with peer relationships and school behavior. Reckless behavior may lead\nto accidental injury to self or others, thrill-seeking, or high-risk behaviors. Individuals who\ncontinue to experience PTSD into older adulthood may express fewer symptoms of hy-\nperarousal, avoidance, and negative cognitions and mood compared with younger adults\nwith PTSD, although adults exposed to traumatic events during later life may display more\navoidance, hyperarousal, sleep problems, and crying spells than do younger adults exposed\nto the same traumatic events. In older individuals, the disorder is associated with negative\nhealth perceptions, primary care utilization, and suicidal ideation.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nRisk (and protective) factors are generally divided into pretraumatic, peritraumatic, and\nposttraumatic factors. \nPretraumatic factors\nTemperamental.\nThese include childhood emotional problems by age 6 years (e.g., prior\ntraumatic exposure, externalizing or anxiety problems) and prior mental disorders (e.g.,\npanic disorder, depressive disorder, PTSD, or obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD]).\nEnvironmental.\nThese include lower socioeconomic status; lower education; exposure to\nprior trauma (especially during childhood); childhood adversity (e.g., economic depriva-\ntion, family dysfunction, parental separation or death); cultural characteristics (e.g., fatal-\nistic or self-blaming coping strategies); lower intelligence; minority racial\/ethnic status;\nand a family psychiatric history. Social support prior to event exposure is protective.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThese include female gender and younger age at the time of\ntrauma exposure (for adults). Certain genotypes may either be protective or increase risk\nof PTSD after exposure to traumatic events. \n278\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\nPeritraumatic factors\nEnvironmental.\nThese include severity (dose) of the trauma (the greater the magnitude\nof trauma, the greater the likelihood of PTSD), perceived life threat, personal injury, in-\nterpersonal violence (particularly trauma perpetrated by a caregiver or involving a wit-\nnessed threat to a caregiver in children), and, for military personnel, being a perpetrator,\nwitnessing atrocities, or killing the enemy. Finally, dissociation that occurs during the trauma\nand persists afterward is a risk factor.\nPosttraumatic factors\nTemperamental.\nThese include negative appraisals, inappropriate coping strategies,\nand development of acute stress disorder.\nEnvironmental.\nThese include subsequent exposure to repeated upsetting reminders, subse-\nquent adverse life events, and financial or other trauma-related losses. Social support (includ-\ning family stability, for children) is a protective factor that moderates outcome after trauma. \nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nThe risk of onset and severity of PTSD may differ across cultural groups as a result of vari-\nation in the type of traumatic exposure (e.g., genocide), the impact on disorder severity of\nthe meaning attributed to the traumatic event (e.g., inability to perform funerary rites after\na mass killing), the ongoing sociocultural context (e.g., residing among unpunished per-\npetrators in postconflict settings), and other cultural factors (e.g., acculturative stress in\nimmigrants). The relative risk for PTSD of particular exposures (e.g., religious persecu-\ntion) may vary across cultural groups. The clinical expression of the symptoms or symp-\ntom clusters of PTSD may vary culturally, particularly with respect to avoidance and\nnumbing symptoms, distressing dreams, and somatic symptoms (e.g., dizziness, short-\nness of breath, heat sensations).\nCultural syndromes and idioms of distress influence the expression of PTSD and the\nrange of comorbid disorders in different cultures by providing behavioral and cognitive\ntemplates that link traumatic exposures to specific symptoms. For example, panic attack\nsymptoms may be salient in PTSD among Cambodians and Latin Americans because of\nthe association of traumatic exposure with panic-like khyâl attacks and ataque de nervios.\nComprehensive evaluation of local expressions of PTSD should include assessment of cul-\ntural concepts of distress (see the chapter “Cultural Formulation” in Section III).\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nPTSD is more prevalent among females than among males across the lifespan. Females in\nthe general population experience PTSD for a longer duration than do males. At least some\nof the increased risk for PTSD in females appears to be attributable to a greater likelihood\nof exposure to traumatic events, such as rape, and other forms of interpersonal violence.\nWithin populations exposed specifically to such stressors, gender differences in risk for\nPTSD are attenuated or nonsignificant.\nSuicide Risk\nTraumatic events such as childhood abuse increase a person’s suicide risk. PTSD is associated\nwith suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, and presence of the disorder may indicate which\nindividuals with ideation eventually make a suicide plan or actually attempt suicide.\nFunctional Consequences of \nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder\nPTSD is associated with high levels of social, occupational, and physical disability, as well\nas considerable economic costs and high levels of medical utilization. Impaired function-\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder\n279\ning is exhibited across social, interpersonal, developmental, educational, physical health,\nand occupational domains. In community and veteran samples, PTSD is associated with\npoor social and family relationships, absenteeism from work, lower income, and lower ed-\nucational and occupational success.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nAdjustment disorders.\nIn adjustment disorders, the stressor can be of any severity or\ntype rather than that required by PTSD Criterion A. The diagnosis of an adjustment dis-\norder is used when the response to a stressor that meets PTSD Criterion A does not meet\nall other PTSD criteria (or criteria for another mental disorder). An adjustment disorder is\nalso diagnosed when the symptom pattern of PTSD occurs in response to a stressor that\ndoes not meet PTSD Criterion A (e.g., spouse leaving, being fired).\nOther posttraumatic disorders and conditions.\nNot all psychopathology that occurs in\nindividuals exposed to an extreme stressor should necessarily be attributed to PTSD. The\ndiagnosis requires that trauma exposure precede the onset or exacerbation of pertinent\nsymptoms. Moreover, if the symptom response pattern to the extreme stressor meets cri-\nteria for another mental disorder, these diagnoses should be given instead of, or in addi-\ntion to, PTSD. Other diagnoses and conditions are excluded if they are better explained by\nPTSD (e.g., symptoms of panic disorder that occur only after exposure to traumatic re-\nminders). If severe, symptom response patterns to the extreme stressor may warrant a sep-\narate diagnosis (e.g., dissociative amnesia). \nAcute stress disorder.\nAcute stress disorder is distinguished from PTSD because the\nsymptom pattern in acute stress disorder is restricted to a duration of 3 days to 1 month\nfollowing exposure to the traumatic event.\nAnxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nIn OCD, there are recurrent\nintrusive thoughts, but these meet the definition of an obsession. In addition, the intrusive\nthoughts are not related to an experienced traumatic event, compulsions are usually pres-\nent, and other symptoms of PTSD or acute stress disorder are typically absent. Neither the\narousal and dissociative symptoms of panic disorder nor the avoidance, irritability, and\nanxiety of generalized anxiety disorder are associated with a specific traumatic event. The\nsymptoms of separation anxiety disorder are clearly related to separation from home or\nfamily, rather than to a traumatic event.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nMajor depression may or may not be preceded by a trau-\nmatic event and should be diagnosed if other PTSD symptoms are absent. Specifically, ma-\njor depressive disorder does not include any PTSD Criterion B or C symptoms. Nor does it\ninclude a number of symptoms from PTSD Criterion D or E.\nPersonality disorders.\nInterpersonal difficulties that had their onset, or were greatly ex-\nacerbated, after exposure to a traumatic event may be an indication of PTSD, rather than a\npersonality disorder, in which such difficulties would be expected independently of any\ntraumatic exposure.\nDissociative disorders.\nDissociative amnesia, dissociative identity disorder, and de-\npersonalization-derealization disorder may or may not be preceded by exposure to a trau-\nmatic event or may or may not have co-occurring PTSD symptoms. When full PTSD criteria\nare also met, however, the PTSD “with dissociative symptoms” subtype should be considered.\nConversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).\nNew onset of somatic\nsymptoms within the context of posttraumatic distress might be an indication of PTSD\nrather than conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).\nPsychotic disorders.\nFlashbacks in PTSD must be distinguished from illusions, halluci-\nnations, and other perceptual disturbances that may occur in schizophrenia, brief psy-\nchotic disorder, and other psychotic disorders; depressive and bipolar disorders with\n280\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\npsychotic features; delirium; substance\/medication-induced disorders; and psychotic dis-\norders due to another medical condition. \nTraumatic brain injury.\nWhen a brain injury occurs in the context of a traumatic event (e.g.,\ntraumatic accident, bomb blast, acceleration\/deceleration trauma), symptoms of PTSD may\nappear. An event causing head trauma may also constitute a psychological traumatic event,\nand tramautic brain injury (TBI)–related neurocognitive symptoms are not mutually exclusive\nand may occur concurrently. Symptoms previously termed postconcussive (e.g., headaches,\ndizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, irritability, concentration deficits) can occur in brain-\ninjured and non-brain-injured populations, including individuals with PTSD. Because symp-\ntoms of PTSD and TBI-related neurocognitive symptoms can overlap, a differential diagnosis\nbetween PTSD and neurocognitive disorder symptoms attributable to TBI may be possible\nbased on the presence of symptoms that are distinctive to each presentation. Whereas reexpe-\nriencing and avoidance are characteristic of PTSD and not the effects of TBI, persistent disori-\nentation and confusion are more specific to TBI (neurocognitive effects) than to PTSD.\nComorbidity\nIndividuals with PTSD are 80% more likely than those without PTSD to have symptoms\nthat meet diagnostic criteria for at least one other mental disorder (e.g., depressive, bipo-\nlar, anxiety, or substance use disorders). Comorbid substance use disorder and conduct\ndisorder are more common among males than among females. Among U.S. military per-\nsonnel and combat veterans who have been deployed to recent wars in Afghanistan and\nIraq, co-occurrence of PTSD and mild TBI is 48%. Although most young children with\nPTSD also have at least one other diagnosis, the patterns of comorbidity are different than\nin adults, with oppositional defiant disorder and separation anxiety disorder predominat-\ning. Finally, there is considerable comorbidity between PTSD and major neurocognitive\ndisorder and some overlapping symptoms between these disorders."}

The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,\nmedication or alcohol) or another medical condition (e.g., mild traumatic brain injury)\nand is not better explained by brief psychotic disorder.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of acute stress disorder is the development of characteristic symp-\ntoms lasting from 3 days to 1 month following exposure to one or more traumatic events.\nTraumatic events that are experienced directly include, but are not limited to, exposure\nto war as a combatant or civilian, threatened or actual violent personal assault (e.g., sexual\n282\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\nviolence, physical attack, active combat, mugging, childhood physical and\/or sexual vio-\nlence, being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attack, torture), natural or human-\nmade disasters (e.g., earthquake, hurricane, airplane crash), and severe accident (e.g.,\nsevere motor vehicle, industrial accident). For children, sexually traumatic events may\ninclude inappropriate sexual experiences without violence or injury. A life-threatening\nillness or debilitating medical condition is not necessarily considered a traumatic event.\nMedical incidents that qualify as traumatic events involve sudden, catastrophic events (e.g.,\nwaking during surgery, anaphylactic shock). Stressful events that do not possess the severe\nand traumatic components of events encompassed by Criterion A may lead to an adjust-\nment disorder but not to acute stress disorder.\nThe clinical presentation of acute stress disorder may vary by individual but typically\ninvolves an anxiety response that includes some form of reexperiencing of or reactivity to\nthe traumatic event. In some individuals, a dissociative or detached presentation can pre-\ndominate, although these individuals typically will also display strong emotional or phys-\niological reactivity in response to trauma reminders. In other individuals, there can be a\nstrong anger response in which reactivity is characterized by irritable or possibly aggres-\nsive responses. The full symptom picture must be present for at least 3 days after the trau-\nmatic event and can be diagnosed only up to 1 month after the event. Symptoms that occur\nimmediately after the event but resolve in less than 3 days would not meet criteria for\nacute stress disorder.\nWitnessed events include, but are not limited to, observing threatened or serious in-\njury, unnatural death, physical or sexual violence inflicted on another individual as a re-\nsult of violent assault, severe domestic violence, severe accident, war, and disaster; it may\nalso include witnessing a medical catastrophe (e.g., a life-threatening hemorrhage) involv-\ning one’s child. Events experienced indirectly through learning about the event are limited\nto close relatives or close friends. Such events must have been violent or accidental—death\ndue to natural causes does not qualify—and include violent personal assault, suicide, se-\nrious accident, or serious injury. The disorder may be especially severe when the stressor\nis interpersonal and intentional (e.g., torture, rape). The likelihood of developing this dis-\norder may increase as the intensity of and physical proximity to the stressor increase.\nThe traumatic event can be reexperienced in various ways. Commonly, the individual\nhas recurrent and intrusive recollections of the event (Criterion B1). The recollections are\nspontaneous or triggered recurrent memories of the event that usually occur in response\nto a stimulus that is reminiscent of the traumatic experience (e.g., the sound of a backfiring\ncar triggering memories of gunshots). These intrusive memories often include sensory\n(e.g., sensing the intense heat that was perceived in a house fire), emotional (e.g., experi-\nencing the fear of believing that one was about to be stabbed), or physiological (e.g., expe-\nriencing the shortness of breath that one suffered during a near-drowning) components.\nDistressing dreams may contain themes that are representative of or thematically re-\nlated to the major threats involved in the traumatic event. (For example, in the case of a\nmotor vehicle accident survivor, the distressing dreams may involve crashing cars gener-\nally; in the case of a combat soldier, the distressing dreams may involve being harmed in\nways other than combat.)\nDissociative states may last from a few seconds to several hours, or even days, during\nwhich components of the event are relived and the individual behaves as though experi-\nencing the event at that moment. While dissociative responses are common during a trau-\nmatic event, only dissociative responses that persist beyond 3 days after trauma exposure\nare considered for the diagnosis of acute stress disorder. For young children, reenactment\nof events related to trauma may appear in play and may include dissociative moments\n(e.g., a child who survives a motor vehicle accident may repeatedly crash toy cars during\nplay in a focused and distressing manner). These episodes, often referred to as flashbacks,\nare typically brief but involve a sense that the traumatic event is occurring in the present\nrather than being remembered in the past and are associated with significant distress.\nAcute Stress Disorder\n283\nSome individuals with the disorder do not have intrusive memories of the event itself,\nbut instead experience intense psychological distress or physiological reactivity when\nthey are exposed to triggering events that resemble or symbolize an aspect of the traumatic\nevent (e.g., windy days for children after a hurricane, entering an elevator for a male or fe-\nmale who was raped in an elevator, seeing someone who resembles one’s perpetrator).\nThe triggering cue could be a physical sensation (e.g., a sense of heat for a burn victim, diz-\nziness for survivors of head trauma), particularly for individuals with highly somatic pre-\nsentations. The individual may have a persistent inability to feel positive emotions (e.g.,\nhappiness, joy, satisfaction, or emotions associated with intimacy, tenderness, or sexual-\nity) but can experience negative emotions such as fear, sadness, anger, guilt, or shame.\nAlterations in awareness can include depersonalization, a detached sense of oneself (e.g.,\nseeing oneself from the other side of the room), or derealization, having a distorted view of\none’s surroundings (e.g., perceiving that things are moving in slow motion, seeing things\nin a daze, not being aware of events that one would normally encode). Some individuals\nalso report an inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event that was\npresumably encoded. This symptom is attributable to dissociative amnesia and is not at-\ntributable to head injury, alcohol, or drugs.\nStimuli associated with the trauma are persistently avoided. The individual may refuse\nto discuss the traumatic experience or may engage in avoidance strategies to minimize\nawareness of emotional reactions (e.g., excessive alcohol use when reminded of the ex-\nperience). This behavioral avoidance may include avoiding watching news coverage of\nthe traumatic experience, refusing to return to a workplace where the trauma occurred, or\navoiding interacting with others who shared the same traumatic experience.\nIt is very common for individuals with acute stress disorder to experience problems\nwith sleep onset and maintenance, which may be associated with nightmares or with gen-\neralized elevated arousal that prevents adequate sleep. Individuals with acute stress dis-\norder may be quick tempered and may even engage in aggressive verbal and\/or physical\nbehavior with little provocation. Acute stress disorder is often characterized by a height-\nened sensitivity to potential threats, including those that are related to the traumatic ex-\nperience (e.g., a motor vehicle accident victim may be especially sensitive to the threat\npotentially caused by any cars or trucks) or those not related to the traumatic event (e.g.,\nfear of having a heart attack). Concentration difficulties, including difficulty remembering\ndaily events (e.g., forgetting one’s telephone number) or attending to focused tasks (e.g.,\nfollowing a conversation for a sustained period of time), are commonly reported. Individ-\nuals with acute stress disorder may be very reactive to unexpected stimuli, displaying a\nheightened startle response or jumpiness to loud noises or unexpected movements (e.g.,\nthe individual may jump markedly in the response to a telephone ringing). \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with acute stress disorder commonly engage in catastrophic or extremely neg-\native thoughts about their role in the traumatic event, their response to the traumatic ex-\nperience, or the likelihood of future harm. For example, an individual with acute stress\ndisorder may feel excessively guilty about not having prevented the traumatic event or\nabout not adapting to the experience more successfully. Individuals with acute stress dis-\norder may also interpret their symptoms in a catastrophic manner, such that flashback\nmemories or emotional numbing may be interpreted as a sign of diminished mental ca-\npacity. It is common for individuals with acute stress disorder to experience panic attacks\nin the initial month after trauma exposure that may be triggered by trauma reminders or\nmay apparently occur spontaneously. Additionally, individuals with acute stress disorder\nmay display chaotic or impulsive behavior. For example, individuals may drive reck-\nlessly, make irrational decisions, or gamble excessively. In children, there may be sig-\nnificant separation anxiety, possibly manifested by excessive needs for attention from\n284\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\ncaregivers. In the case of bereavement following a death that occurred in traumatic cir-\ncumstances, the symptoms of acute stress disorder can involve acute grief reactions. In\nsuch cases, reexperiencing, dissociative, and arousal symptoms may involve reactions to\nthe loss, such as intrusive memories of the circumstances of the individual’s death, disbe-\nlief that the individual has died, and anger about the death. Postconcussive symptoms\n(e.g., headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, irritability, concentration deficits),\nwhich occur frequently following mild traumatic brain injury, are also frequently seen in\nindividuals with acute stress disorder. Postconcussive symptoms are equally common in\nbrain-injured and non–brain-injured populations, and the frequent occurrence of postcon-\ncussive symptoms could be attributable to acute stress disorder symptoms. \nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of acute stress disorder in recently trauma-exposed populations (i.e.,\nwithin 1 month of trauma exposure) varies according to the nature of the event and the\ncontext in which it is assessed. In both U.S. and non-U.S. populations, acute stress disorder\ntends to be identified in less than 20% of cases following traumatic events that do not in-\nvolve interpersonal assault; 13%–21% of motor vehicle accidents, 14% of mild traumatic\nbrain injury, 19% of assault, 10% of severe burns, and 6%–12% of industrial accidents.\nHigher rates (i.e., 20%–50%) are reported following interpersonal traumatic events, in-\ncluding assault, rape, and witnessing a mass shooting. \nDevelopment and Course\nAcute stress disorder cannot be diagnosed until 3 days after a traumatic event. Although\nacute stress disorder may progress to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after 1 month,\nit may also be a transient stress response that remits within 1 month of trauma exposure\nand does not result in PTSD. Approximately half of individuals who eventually develop\nPTSD initially present with acute stress disorder. Symptom worsening during the initial\nmonth can occur, often as a result of ongoing life stressors or further traumatic events. \nThe forms of reexperiencing can vary across development. Unlike adults or adoles-\ncents, young children may report frightening dreams without content that clearly reflects\naspects of the trauma (e.g., waking in fright in the aftermath of the trauma but being unable\nto relate the content of the dream to the traumatic event). Children age 6 years and younger\nare more likely than older children to express reexperiencing symptoms through play that\nrefers directly or symbolically to the trauma. For example, a very young child who sur-\nvived a fire may draw pictures of flames. Young children also do not necessarily manifest\nfearful reactions at the time of the exposure or even during reexperiencing. Parents typi-\ncally report a range of emotional expressions, such as anger, shame, or withdrawal, and\neven excessively bright positive affect, in young children who are traumatized. Although\nchildren may avoid reminders of the trauma, they sometimes become preoccupied with\nreminders (e.g., a young child bitten by a dog may talk about dogs constantly yet avoid go-\ning outside because of fear of coming into contact with a dog). \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nTemperamental.\nRisk factors include prior mental disorder, high levels of negative af-\nfectivity (neuroticism), greater perceived severity of the traumatic event, and an avoidant\ncoping style. Catastrophic appraisals of the traumatic experience, often characterized by\nexaggerated appraisals of future harm, guilt, or hopelessness, are strongly predictive of\nacute stress disorder. \nEnvironmental.\nFirst and foremost, an individual must be exposed to a traumatic event to\nbe at risk for acute stress disorder. Risk factors for the disorder include a history of prior\ntrauma.\nAcute Stress Disorder\n285\nGenetic and physiological.\nFemales are at greater risk for developing acute stress dis-\norder.\nElevated reactivity, as reflected by acoustic startle response, prior to trauma exposure\nincreases the risk for developing acute stress disorder. \nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nThe profile of symptoms of acute stress disorder may vary cross-culturally, particularly\nwith respect to dissociative symptoms, nightmares, avoidance, and somatic symptoms\n(e.g., dizziness, shortness of breath, heat sensations). Cultural syndromes and idioms of\ndistress shape the local symptom profiles of acute stress disorder. Some cultural groups\nmay display variants of dissociative responses, such as possession or trancelike behaviors\nin the initial month after trauma exposure. Panic symptoms may be salient in acute stress\ndisorder among Cambodians because of the association of traumatic exposure with panic-\nlike khyâl attacks, and ataque de nervios among Latin Americans may also follow a traumatic\nexposure. \nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nAcute stress disorder is more prevalent among females than among males. Sex-linked neu-\nrobiological differences in stress response may contribute to females’ increased risk for\nacute stress disorder. The increased risk for the disorder in females may be attributable in\npart to a greater likelihood of exposure to the types of traumatic events with a high con-\nditional risk for acute stress disorder, such as rape and other interpersonal violence. \nFunctional Consequences of Acute Stress Disorder\nImpaired functioning in social, interpersonal, or occupational domains has been shown\nacross survivors of accidents, assault, and rape who develop acute stress disorder. The ex-\ntreme levels of anxiety that may be associated with acute stress disorder may interfere\nwith sleep, energy levels, and capacity to attend to tasks. Avoidance in acute stress dis-\norder can result in generalized withdrawal from many situations that are perceived as\npotentially threatening, which can lead to nonattendance of medical appointments, avoid-\nance of driving to important appointments, and absenteeism from work. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nAdjustment disorders.\nIn acute stress disorder, the stressor can be of any severity rather\nthan of the severity and type required by Criterion A of acute stress disorder. The diagnosis of\nan adjustment disorder is used when the response to a Criterion A event does not meet the cri-\nteria for acute stress disorder (or another specific mental disorder) and when the symptom pat-\ntern of acute stress disorder occurs in response to a stressor that does not meet Criterion A for\nexposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence (e.g., spouse leaving,\nbeing fired). For example, severe stress reactions to life-threatening illnesses that may include\nsome acute stress disorder symptoms may be more appropriately described as an adjustment\ndisorder. Some forms of acute stress response do not include acute stress disorder symptoms\nand may be characterized by anger, depression, or guilt. These responses are more appro-\npriately described as primarily an adjustment disorder. Depressive or anger responses in an\nadjustment disorder may involve rumination about the traumatic event, as opposed to invol-\nuntary and intrusive distressing memories in acute stress disorder.\nPanic disorder.\nSpontaneous panic attacks are very common in acute stress disorder.\nHowever, panic disorder is diagnosed only if panic attacks are unexpected and there is\nanxiety about future attacks or maladaptive changes in behavior associated with fear of\ndire consequences of the attacks. \n286\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\nDissociative disorders.\nSevere dissociative responses (in the absence of characteristic\nacute stress disorder symptoms) may be diagnosed as derealization\/depersonalization\ndisorder. If severe amnesia of the trauma persists in the absence of characteristic acute\nstress disorder symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative amnesia may be indicated.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder.\nAcute stress disorder is distinguished from PTSD because\nthe symptom pattern in acute stress disorder must occur within 1 month of the traumatic event\nand resolve within that 1-month period. If the symptoms persist for more than 1 month and\nmeet criteria for PTSD, the diagnosis is changed from acute stress disorder to PTSD.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nIn obsessive-compulsive disorder, there are recurrent\nintrusive thoughts, but these meet the definition of an obsession. In addition, the intrusive\nthoughts are not related to an experienced traumatic event, compulsions are usually pres-\nent, and other symptoms of acute stress disorder are typically absent.\nPsychotic disorders.\nFlashbacks in acute stress disorder must be distinguished from il-\nlusions, hallucinations, and other perceptual disturbances that may occur in schizophre-\nnia, other psychotic disorders, depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, a\ndelirium, substance\/medication-induced disorders, and psychotic disorders due to an-\nother medical condition. Acute stress disorder flashbacks are distinguished from these\nother perceptual disturbances by being directly related to the traumatic experience and by\noccurring in the absence of other psychotic or substance-induced features.\nTraumatic brain injury.\nWhen a brain injury occurs in the context of a traumatic event\n(e.g., traumatic accident, bomb blast, acceleration\/deceleration trauma), symptoms of\nacute stress disorder may appear. An event causing head trauma may also constitute a\npsychological traumatic event, and tramautic brain injury (TBI)–related neurocognitive\nsymptoms are not mutually exclusive and may occur concurrently. Symptoms previously\ntermed postconcussive (e.g., headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, irritability,\nconcentration deficits) can occur in brain-injured and non–brain injured populations, in-\ncluding individuals with acute stress disorder. Because symptoms of acute stress disorder\nand TBI-related neurocognitive symptoms can overlap, a differential diagnosis between\nacute stress disorder and neurocognitive disorder symptoms attributable to TBI may be\npossible based on the presence of symptoms that are distinctive to each presenta-\ntion. Whereas reexperiencing and avoidance are characteristic of acute stress disorder and\nnot the effects of TBI, persistent disorientation and confusion are more specific to TBI (neu-\nrocognitive effects) than to acute stress disorder. Furthermore, differential is aided by the\nfact that symptoms of acute stress disorder persist for up to only 1 month following trauma\nexposure."}

The development of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable\nstressor(s) occurring within 3 months of the onset of the stressor(s).\nB. These symptoms or behaviors are clinically significant, as evidenced by one or both of\nthe following:\n1. Marked distress that is out of proportion to the severity or intensity of the stressor,\ntaking into account the external context and the cultural factors that might influence\nsymptom severity and presentation.\n2. Significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\nC. The stress-related disturbance does not meet the criteria for another mental disorder\nand is not merely an exacerbation of a preexisting mental disorder.\nAdjustment Disorders\n287\nD. The symptoms do not represent normal bereavement.\nE. Once the stressor or its consequences have terminated, the symptoms do not persist\nfor more than an additional 6 months.\nSpecify whether:\n309.0 (F43.21) With depressed mood: Low mood, tearfulness, or feelings of hope-\nlessness are predominant.\n309.24 (F43.22) With anxiety: Nervousness, worry, jitteriness, or separation anxiety\nis predominant.\n309.28 (F43.23) With mixed anxiety and depressed mood: A combination of de-\npression and anxiety is predominant.\n309.3 (F43.24) With disturbance of conduct: Disturbance of conduct is predominant.\n309.4 (F43.25) With mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct: Both emotional\nsymptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) and a disturbance of conduct are predominant.\n309.9 (F43.20) Unspecified: For maladaptive reactions that are not classifiable as one\nof the specific subtypes of adjustment disorder.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe presence of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor\nis the essential feature of adjustment disorders (Criterion A). The stressor may be a single\nevent (e.g., a termination of a romantic relationship), or there may be multiple stressors\n(e.g., marked business difficulties and marital problems). Stressors may be recurrent (e.g.,\nassociated with seasonal business crises, unfulfilling sexual relationships) or continuous\n(e.g., a persistent painful illness with increasing disability, living in a crime-ridden neigh-\nborhood). Stressors may affect a single individual, an entire family, or a larger group or\ncommunity (e.g., a natural disaster). Some stressors may accompany specific developmen-\ntal events (e.g., going to school, leaving a parental home, reentering a parental home, get-\nting married, becoming a parent, failing to attain occupational goals, retirement). \nAdjustment disorders may be diagnosed following the death of a loved one when the\nintensity, quality, or persistence of grief reactions exceeds what normally might be ex-\npected, when cultural, religious, or age-appropriate norms are taken into account. A more\nspecific set of bereavement-related symptoms has been designated persistent complex be-\nreavement disorder.\nAdjustment disorders are associated with an increased risk of suicide attempts and\ncompleted suicide.\nPrevalence\nAdjustment disorders are common, although prevalence may vary widely as a function of\nthe population studied and the assessment methods used. The percentage of individuals\nin outpatient mental health treatment with a principal diagnosis of an adjustment disorder\nranges from approximately 5% to 20%. In a hospital psychiatric consultation setting, it is\noften the most common diagnosis, frequently reaching 50%. \nDevelopment and Course\nBy definition, the disturbance in adjustment disorders begins within 3 months of onset of\na stressor and lasts no longer than 6 months after the stressor or its consequences have\nceased. If the stressor is an acute event (e.g., being fired from a job), the onset of the dis-\nturbance is usually immediate (i.e., within a few days) and the duration is relatively brief\n(i.e., no more than a few months). If the stressor or its consequences persist, the adjustment\ndisorder may also continue to be present and become the persistent form.\n288\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nEnvironmental.\nIndividuals from disadvantaged life circumstances experience a high\nrate of stressors and may be at increased risk for adjustment disorders.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nThe context of the individual’s cultural setting should be taken into account in making the\nclinical judgment of whether the individual’s response to the stressor is maladaptive or\nwhether the associated distress is in excess of what would be expected. The nature, mean-\ning, and experience of the stressors and the evaluation of the response to the stressors may\nvary across cultures. \nFunctional Consequences of Adjustment Disorders\nThe subjective distress or impairment in functioning associated with adjustment disorders\nis frequently manifested as decreased performance at work or school and temporary\nchanges in social relationships. An adjustment disorder may complicate the course of ill-\nness in individuals who have a general medical condition (e.g., decreased compliance with\nthe recommended medical regimen; increased length of hospital stay). \nDifferential Diagnosis\nMajor depressive disorder.\nIf an individual has symptoms that meet criteria for a major\ndepressive disorder in response to a stressor, the diagnosis of an adjustment disorder is\nnot applicable. The symptom profile of major depressive disorder differentiates it from ad-\njustment disorders.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder.\nIn adjustment disorders, the\nstressor can be of any severity rather than of the severity and type required by Criterion A\nof acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In distinguishing ad-\njustment disorders from these two posttraumatic diagnoses, there are both timing and\nsymptom profile considerations. Adjustment disorders can be diagnosed immediately\nand persist up to 6 months after exposure to the traumatic event, whereas acute stress dis-\norder can only occur between 3 days and 1 month of exposure to the stressor, and PTSD\ncannot be diagnosed until at least 1 month has passed since the occurrence of the traumatic\nstressor. The required symptom profile for PTSD and acute stress disorder differentiates\nthem from the adjustment disorders. With regard to symptom profiles, an adjustment dis-\norder may be diagnosed following a traumatic event when an individual exhibits symptoms\nof either acute stress disorder or PTSD that do not meet or exceed the diagnostic threshold\nfor either disorder. An adjustment disorder should also be diagnosed for individuals who\nhave not been exposed to a traumatic event but who otherwise exhibit the full symptom pro-\nfile of either acute stress disorder or PTSD.\nPersonality disorders.\nWith regard to personality disorders, some personality features\nmay be associated with a vulnerability to situational distress that may resemble an adjust-\nment disorder. The lifetime history of personality functioning will help inform the in-\nterpretation of distressed behaviors to aid in distinguishing a long-standing personality\ndisorder from an adjustment disorder. In addition to some personality disorders incurring\nvulnerability to distress, stressors may also exacerbate personality disorder symptoms. In\nthe presence of a personality disorder, if the symptom criteria for an adjustment disorder\nare met, and the stress-related disturbance exceeds what may be attributable to maladap-\ntive personality disorder symptoms (i.e., Criterion C is met), then the diagnosis of an ad-\njustment disorder should be made.\nOther Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder\n289\nPsychological factors affecting other medical conditions.\nIn psychological factors af-\nfecting other medical conditions, specific psychological entities (e.g., psychological symp-\ntoms, behaviors, other factors) exacerbate a medical condition. These psychological\nfactors can precipitate, exacerbate, or put an individual at risk for medical illness, or they\ncan worsen an existing condition. In contrast, an adjustment disorder is a reaction to the\nstressor (e.g., having a medical illness).\nNormative stress reactions.\nWhen bad things happen, most people get upset. This is\nnot an adjustment disorder. The diagnosis should only be made when the magnitude of\nthe distress (e.g., alterations in mood, anxiety, or conduct) exceeds what would normally\nbe expected (which may vary in different cultures) or when the adverse event precipitates\nfunctional impairment.\nComorbidity\nAdjustment disorders can accompany most mental disorders and any medical disorder.\nAdjustment disorders can be diagnosed in addition to another mental disorder only if the\nlatter does not explain the particular symptoms that occur in reaction to the stressor. For\nexample, an individual may develop an adjustment disorder, with depressed mood, after\nlosing a job and at the same time have a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Or,\nan individual may have a depressive or bipolar disorder and an adjustment disorder as\nlong as the criteria for both are met. Adjustment disorders are common accompaniments\nof medical illness and may be the major psychological response to a medical disorder."}
