The clin-\nical features described below are those considered most important in making the diagno-\nsis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome based on consensus recommendations.\n710\nMedication-Induced Movement Disorders\nDiagnostic Features\nPatients have generally been exposed to a dopamine antagonist within 72 hours prior to\nsymptom development. Hyperthermia (100.4F or 38.0C on at least two occasions,\nmeasured orally), associated with profuse diaphoresis, is a distinguishing feature of neu-\nroleptic malignant syndrome, setting it apart from other neurological side effects of anti-\npsychotic medications. Extreme elevations in temperature, reflecting a breakdown in\ncentral thermoregulation, are more likely to support the diagnosis of neuroleptic malig-\nnant syndrome. Generalized rigidity, described as “lead pipe” in its most severe form and\nusually unresponsive to antiparkinsonian agents, is a cardinal feature of the disorder and\nmay be associated with other neurological symptoms (e.g., tremor, sialorrhea, akinesia,\ndystonia, trismus, myoclonus, dysarthria, dysphagia, rhabdomyolysis). Creatine kinase\nelevation of at least four times the upper limit of normal is commonly seen. Changes in\nmental status, characterized by delirium or altered consciousness ranging from stupor to\ncoma, are often an early sign. Affected individuals may appear alert but dazed and unre-\nsponsive, consistent with catatonic stupor. Autonomic activation and instability—mani-\nfested by tachycardia (rate25% above baseline), diaphoresis, blood pressure elevation\n(systolic or diastolic 25% above baseline) or fluctuation (20 mmHg diastolic change or\n25 mmHg systolic change within 24 hours), urinary incontinence, and pallor—may be\nseen at any time but provide an early clue to the diagnosis. Tachypnea (rate 50% above\nbaseline) is common, and respiratory distress—resulting from metabolic acidosis, hyper-\nmetabolism, chest wall restriction, aspiration pneumonia, or pulmonary emboli—can oc-\ncur and lead to sudden respiratory arrest.\nA workup, including laboratory investigation, to exclude other infectious, toxic, met-\nabolic, and neuropsychiatric etiologies or complications is essential (see the section “Dif-\nferential Diagnosis” later in this discussion). Although several laboratory abnormalities\nare associated with neuroleptic malignant syndrome, no single abnormality is specific to\nthe diagnosis. Individuals with neuroleptic malignant syndrome may have leukocytosis,\nmetabolic acidosis, hypoxia, decreased serum iron concentrations, and elevations in se-\nrum muscle enzymes and catecholamines. Findings from cerebrospinal fluid analysis and\nneuroimaging studies are generally normal, whereas electroencephalography shows gen-\neralized slowing. Autopsy findings in fatal cases have been nonspecific and variable, de-\npending on complications.\nDevelopment and Course\nEvidence from database studies suggests incidence rates for neuroleptic malignant syn-\ndrome of 0.01%–0.02% among individuals treated with antipsychotics. The temporal pro-\ngression of signs and symptoms provides important clues to the diagnosis and prognosis\nof neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Alteration in mental status and other neurological\nsigns typically precede systemic signs. The onset of symptoms varies from hours to days\nafter drug initiation. Some cases develop within 24 hours after drug initiation, most within\nthe first week, and virtually all cases within 30 days. Once the syndrome is diagnosed and\noral antipsychotic drugs are discontinued, neuroleptic malignant syndrome is self-limited\nin most cases. The mean recovery time after drug discontinuation is 7–10 days, with most\nindividuals recovering within 1 week and nearly all within 30 days. The duration may be\nprolonged when long-acting antipsychotics are implicated. There have been reports of in-\ndividuals in whom residual neurological signs persisted for weeks after the acute hyper-\nmetabolic symptoms resolved. Total resolution of symptoms can be obtained in most\ncases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome; however, fatality rates of 10%–20% have been\nreported when the disorder is not recognized. Although many individuals do not experi-\nence a recurrence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome when rechallenged with antipsy-\nchotic medication, some do, especially when antipsychotics are reinstituted soon after an\nepisode.\nMedication-Induced Movement Disorders\n711\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome is a potential risk in any individual after antipsychotic\ndrug administration. It is not specific to any neuropsychiatric diagnosis and may occur in\nindividuals without a diagnosable mental disorder who receive dopamine antagonists.\nClinical, systemic, and metabolic factors associated with a heightened risk of neuroleptic\nmalignant syndrome include agitation, exhaustion, dehydration, and iron deficiency. A\nprior episode associated with antipsychotics has been described in 15%–20% of index\ncases, suggesting underlying vulnerability in some patients; however, genetic findings\nbased on neurotransmitter receptor polymorphisms have not been replicated consistently.\nNearly all dopamine antagonists have been associated with neuroleptic malignant\nsyndrome, although high-potency antipsychotics pose a greater risk compared with low-\npotency agents and newer atypical antipsychotics. Partial or milder forms may be associ-\nated with newer antipsychotics, but neuroleptic malignant syndrome varies in severity\neven with older drugs. Dopamine antagonists used in medical settings (e.g., metoclopra-\nmide, prochlorperazine) have also been implicated. Parenteral administration routes,\nrapid titration rates, and higher total drug dosages have been associated with increased\nrisk; however, neuroleptic malignant syndrome usually occurs within the therapeutic dos-\nage range of antipsychotics.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome must be distinguished from other serious neurological\nor medical conditions, including central nervous system infections, inflammatory or au-\ntoimmune conditions, status epilepticus, subcortical structural lesions, and systemic con-\nditions (e.g., pheochromocytoma, thyrotoxicosis, tetanus, heat stroke).\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome also must be distinguished from similar syndromes\nresulting from the use of other substances or medications, such as serotonin syndrome;\nparkinsonian hyperthermia syndrome following abrupt discontinuation of dopamine ag-\nonists; alcohol or sedative withdrawal; malignant hyperthermia occurring during anes-\nthesia; hyperthermia associated with abuse of stimulants and hallucinogens; and atropine\npoisoning from anticholinergics.\nIn rare instances, individuals with schizophrenia or a mood disorder may present with\nmalignant catatonia, which may be indistinguishable from neuroleptic malignant syn-\ndrome. Some investigators consider neuroleptic malignant syndrome to be a drug-\ninduced form of malignant catatonia."}

Symptoms generally begin within 2–4 days and\ntypically include specific sensory, somatic, and cognitive-emotional manifestations. Fre-\nMedication-Induced Movement Disorders\n713\nquently reported sensory and somatic symptoms include flashes of lights, “electric shock”\nsensations, nausea, and hyperresponsivity to noises or lights. Nonspecific anxiety and\nfeelings of dread may also be reported. Symptoms are alleviated by restarting the same\nmedication or starting a different medication that has a similar mechanism of action—\nfor example, discontinuation symptoms after withdrawal from a serotonin-norepineph-\nrine reuptake inhibitor may be alleviated by starting a tricyclic antidepressant. To qualify\nas antidepressant discontinuation syndrome, the symptoms should not have been present\nbefore the antidepressant dosage was reduced and are not better explained by another\nmental disorder (e.g., manic or hypomanic episode, substance intoxication, substance\nwithdrawal, somatic symptom disorder).\nDiagnostic Features\nDiscontinuation symptoms may occur following treatment with tricyclic antidepressants\n(e.g., imipramine, amitriptyline, desipramine), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluox-\netine, paroxetine, sertraline), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., phenelzine, selegi-\nline, pargyline). The incidence of this syndrome depends on the dosage and half-life of the\nmedication being taken, as well as the rate at which the medication is tapered. Short-acting\nmedications that are stopped abruptly rather than tapered gradually may pose the great-\nest risk. The short-acting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine is the\nagent most commonly associated with discontinuation symptoms, but such symptoms oc-\ncur for all types of antidepressants.\nUnlike withdrawal syndromes associated with opioids, alcohol, and other substances\nof abuse, antidepressant discontinuation syndrome has no pathognomonic symptoms. In-\nstead, the symptoms tend to be vague and variable and typically begin 2–4 days after the\nlast dose of the antidepressant. For SSRIs (e.g., paroxetine), symptoms such as dizziness,\nringing in the ears, “electric shocks in the head,” an inability to sleep, and acute anxiety are\ndescribed. The antidepressant use prior to discontinuation must not have incurred hypo-\nmania or euphoria (i.e., there should be confidence that the discontinuation syndrome is\nnot the result of fluctuations in mood stability associated with the previous treatment).\nThe antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is based solely on pharmacological factors\nand is not related to the reinforcing effects of an antidepressant. Also, in the case of stim-\nulant augmentation of an antidepressant, abrupt cessation may result in stimulant with-\ndrawal symptoms (see “Stimulant Withdrawal” in the chapter “Substance-Related and\nAddictive Disorders”) rather than the antidepressant discontinuation syndrome described\nhere.\nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is unknown but is thought to\nvary according to the dosage prior to discontinuation, the half-life and receptor-binding\naffinity of the medication, and possibly the individual’s genetically influenced rate of me-\ntabolism for this medication.\nCourse and Development\nBecause longitudinal studies are lacking, little is known about the clinical course of anti-\ndepressant discontinuation syndrome. Symptoms appear to abate over time with very\ngradual dosage reductions. After an episode, some individuals may prefer to resume med-\nication indefinitely if tolerated.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThe differential diagnosis of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome includes anxiety\nand depressive disorders, substance use disorders, and tolerance to medications.\n714\nMedication-Induced Movement Disorders\nAnxiety and depressive disorders.\nDiscontinuation symptoms often resemble symptoms\nof a persistent anxiety disorder or a return of somatic symptoms of depression for which\nthe medication was initially given.\nSubstance use disorders.\nAntidepressant discontinuation syndrome differs from sub-\nstance withdrawal in that antidepressants themselves have no reinforcing or euphoric ef-\nfects. The medication dosage has usually not been increased without the clinician’s\npermission, and the individual generally does not engage in drug-seeking behavior to ob-\ntain additional medication. Criteria for a substance use disorder are not met.\nTolerance to medications.\nTolerance and discontinuation symptoms can occur as a\nnormal physiological response to stopping medication after a substantial duration of\nexposure. Most cases of medication tolerance can be managed through carefully con-\ntrolled tapering.\nComorbidity\nTypically, the individual was initially started on the medication for a major depressive dis-\norder; the original symptoms may return during the discontinuation syndrome."}
