A pattern of angry\/irritable mood, argumentative\/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness lasting\nat least 6 months as evidenced by at least four symptoms from any of the following cate-\ngories, and exhibited during interaction with at least one individual who is not a sibling.\nAngry\/Irritable Mood\n1. Often loses temper.\n2. Is often touchy or easily annoyed.\n3. Is often angry and resentful.\nArgumentative\/Defiant Behavior\n4. Often argues with authority figures or, for children and adolescents, with adults.\n5. Often actively defies or refuses to comply with requests from authority figures or\nwith rules.\n6. Often deliberately annoys others.\n7. Often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior.\nVindictiveness\n8. Has been spiteful or vindictive at least twice within the past 6 months.\nNote: The persistence and frequency of these behaviors should be used to distinguish\na behavior that is within normal limits from a behavior that is symptomatic. For children\nyounger than 5 years, the behavior should occur on most days for a period of at least\n6 months unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8). For individuals 5 years or older, the\nbehavior should occur at least once per week for at least 6 months, unless otherwise\nnoted (Criterion A8). While these frequency criteria provide guidance on a minimal lev-\nel of frequency to define symptoms, other factors should also be considered, such as\nwhether the frequency and intensity of the behaviors are outside a range that is nor-\nmative for the individual’s developmental level, gender, and culture.\nB. The disturbance in behavior is associated with distress in the individual or others in his or\nher immediate social context (e.g., family, peer group, work colleagues), or it impacts neg-\natively on social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. \nC. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during the course of a psychotic, substance\nuse, depressive, or bipolar disorder. Also, the criteria are not met for disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder.\nSpecify current severity:\nMild: Symptoms are confined to only one setting (e.g., at home, at school, at work, with\npeers).\nOppositional Defiant Disorder\n463\nModerate: Some symptoms are present in at least two settings.\nSevere: Some symptoms are present in three or more settings.\nSpecifiers\nIt is not uncommon for individuals with oppositional defiant disorder to show symptoms\nonly at home and only with family members. However, the pervasiveness of the symp-\ntoms is an indicator of the severity of the disorder.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of oppositional defiant disorder is a frequent and persistent pattern\nof angry\/irritable mood, argumentative\/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness (Criterion\nA). It is not unusual for individuals with oppositional defiant disorder to show the behav-\nioral features of the disorder without problems of negative mood. However, individuals\nwith the disorder who show the angry\/irritable mood symptoms typically show the be-\nhavioral features as well. \nThe symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder may be confined to only one setting,\nand this is most frequently the home. Individuals who show enough symptoms to meet\nthe diagnostic threshold, even if it is only at home, may be significantly impaired in their\nsocial functioning. However, in more severe cases, the symptoms of the disorder are pres-\nent in multiple settings. Given that the pervasiveness of symptoms is an indicator of the\nseverity of the disorder, it is critical that the individual’s behavior be assessed across mul-\ntiple settings and relationships. Because these behaviors are common among siblings, they\nmust be observed during interactions with persons other than siblings. Also, because\nsymptoms of the disorder are typically more evident in interactions with adults or peers\nwhom the individual knows well, they may not be apparent during a clinical examination. \nThe symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder can occur to some degree in individu-\nals without this disorder. There are several key considerations for determining if the be-\nhaviors are symptomatic of oppositional defiant disorder. First, the diagnostic threshold\nof four or more symptoms within the preceding 6 months must be met. Second, the per-\nsistence and frequency of the symptoms should exceed what is normative for an individ-\nual’s age, gender, and culture. For example, it is not unusual for preschool children to\nshow temper tantrums on a weekly basis. Temper outbursts for a preschool child would be\nconsidered a symptom of oppositional defiant disorder only if they occurred on most days\nfor the preceding 6 months, if they occurred with at least three other symptoms of the dis-\norder, and if the temper outbursts contributed to the significant impairment associated\nwith the disorder (e.g., led to destruction of property during outbursts, resulted in the\nchild being asked to leave a preschool). \nThe symptoms of the disorder often are part of a pattern of problematic interactions\nwith others. Furthermore, individuals with this disorder typically do not regard themselves\nas angry, oppositional, or defiant. Instead, they often justify their behavior as a response to\nunreasonable demands or circumstances. Thus, it can be difficult to disentangle the rela-\ntive contribution of the individual with the disorder to the problematic interactions he or\nshe experiences. For example, children with oppositional defiant disorder may have ex-\nperienced a history of hostile parenting, and it is often impossible to determine if the\nchild’s behavior caused the parents to act in a more hostile manner toward the child, if the\nparents’ hostility led to the child’s problematic behavior, or if there was some combination\nof both. Whether or not the clinician can separate the relative contributions of potential\ncausal factors should not influence whether or not the diagnosis is made. In the event that\nthe child may be living in particularly poor conditions where neglect or mistreatment may\noccur (e.g., in institutional settings), clinical attention to reducing the contribution of the\nenvironment may be helpful. \n464\nDisruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIn children and adolescents, oppositional defiant disorder is more prevalent in families in\nwhich child care is disrupted by a succession of different caregivers or in families in which\nharsh, inconsistent, or neglectful child-rearing practices are common. Two of the most\ncommon co-occurring conditions with oppositional defiant disorder are attention-deficit\/\nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder (see the section “Comorbidity” for\nthis disorder). Oppositional defiant disorder has been associated with increased risk for\nsuicide attempts, even after comorbid disorders are controlled for. \nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of oppositional defiant disorder ranges from 1% to 11%, with an average\nprevalence estimate of around 3.3%. The rate of oppositional defiant disorder may vary\ndepending on the age and gender of the child. The disorder appears to be somewhat more\nprevalent in males than in females (1.4:1) prior to adolescence. This male predominance is\nnot consistently found in samples of adolescents or adults. \nDevelopment and Course\nThe first symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder usually appear during the preschool\nyears and rarely later than early adolescence. Oppositional defiant disorder often precedes\nthe development of conduct disorder, especially for those with the childhood-onset type\nof conduct disorder. However, many children and adolescents with oppositional defiant\ndisorder do not subsequently develop conduct disorder. Oppositional defiant disorder\nalso conveys risk for the development of anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder,\neven in the absence of conduct disorder. The defiant, argumentative, and vindictive symp-\ntoms carry most of the risk for conduct disorder, whereas the angry-irritable mood symp-\ntoms carry most of the risk for emotional disorders. \nManifestations of the disorder across development appear consistent. Children and\nadolescents with oppositional defiant disorder are at increased risk for a number of prob-\nlems in adjustment as adults, including antisocial behavior, impulse-control problems,\nsubstance abuse, anxiety, and depression.\nMany of the behaviors associated with oppositional defiant disorder increase in fre-\nquency during the preschool period and in adolescence. Thus, it is especially critical dur-\ning these development periods that the frequency and intensity of these behaviors be\nevaluated against normative levels before it is decided that they are symptoms of opposi-\ntional defiant disorder.\nRisk and Prognostic Features\nTemperamental.\nTemperamental factors related to problems in emotional regulation\n(e.g., high levels of emotional reactivity, poor frustration tolerance) have been predictive\nof the disorder.\nEnvironmental.\nHarsh, inconsistent, or neglectful child-rearing practices are common in\nfamilies of children and adolescents with oppositional defiant disorder, and these parent-\ning practices play an important role in many causal theories of the disorder. \nGenetic and physiological.\nA number of neurobiological markers (e.g., lower heart rate\nand skin conductance reactivity; reduced basal cortisol reactivity; abnormalities in the pre-\nfrontal cortex and amygdala) have been associated with oppositional defiant disorder.\nHowever, the vast majority of studies have not separated children with oppositional de-\nfiant disorder from those with conduct disorder. Thus, it is unclear whether there are\nmarkers specific to oppositional defiant disorder.\nOppositional Defiant Disorder\n465\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nThe prevalence of the disorder in children and adolescents is relatively consistent across\ncountries that differ in race and ethnicity.\nFunctional Consequences of \nOppositional Defiant Disorder\nWhen oppositional defiant disorder is persistent throughout development, individuals\nwith the disorder experience frequent conflicts with parents, teachers, supervisors, peers,\nand romantic partners. Such problems often result in significant impairments in the indi-\nvidual’s emotional, social, academic, and occupational adjustment. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nConduct disorder.\nConduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder are both related\nto conduct problems that bring the individual in conflict with adults and other authority\nfigures (e.g., teachers, work supervisors). The behaviors of oppositional defiant disorder\nare typically of a less severe nature than those of conduct disorder and do not include ag-\ngression toward people or animals, destruction of property, or a pattern of theft or deceit.\nFurthermore, oppositional defiant disorder includes problems of emotional dysregulation\n(i.e., angry and irritable mood) that are not included in the definition of conduct disorder. \nAttention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder.\nADHD is often comorbid with oppositional de-\nfiant disorder. To make the additional diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder, it is impor-\ntant to determine that the individual’s failure to conform to requests of others is not solely in\nsituations that demand sustained effort and attention or demand that the individual sit still. \nDepressive and bipolar disorders.\nDepressive and bipolar disorders often involve neg-\native affect and irritability. As a result, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder should\nnot be made if the symptoms occur exclusively during the course of a mood disorder. \nDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder.\nOppositional defiant disorder shares with dis-\nruptive mood dysregulation disorder the symptoms of chronic negative mood and temper\noutbursts. However, the severity, frequency, and chronicity of temper outbursts are more\nsevere in individuals with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder than in those with\noppositional defiant disorder. Thus, only a minority of children and adolescents whose\nsymptoms meet criteria for oppositional defiant disorder would also be diagnosed with dis-\nruptive mood dysregulation disorder. When the mood disturbance is severe enough to meet\ncriteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant dis-\norder is not given, even if all criteria for oppositional defiant disorder are met.\nIntermittent explosive disorder.\nIntermittent explosive disorder also involves high\nrates of anger. However, individuals with this disorder show serious aggression toward\nothers that is not part of the definition of oppositional defiant disorder. \nIntellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).\nIn individuals with intel-\nlectual disability, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder is given only if the opposi-\ntional behavior is markedly greater than is commonly observed among individuals of\ncomparable mental age and with comparable severity of intellectual disability. \nLanguage disorder.\nOppositional defiant disorder must also be distinguished from a\nfailure to follow directions that is the result of impaired language comprehension (e.g.,\nhearing loss). \nSocial anxiety disorder (social phobia).\nOppositional defiant disorder must also be dis-\ntinguished from defiance due to fear of negative evaluation associated with social anxiety\ndisorder.\n466\nDisruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders\nComorbidity \nRates of oppositional defiant disorder are much higher in samples of children, adoles-\ncents, and adults with ADHD, and this may be the result of shared temperamental risk fac-\ntors. Also, oppositional defiant disorder often precedes conduct disorder, although this\nappears to be most common in children with the childhood-onset subtype. Individuals\nwith oppositional defiant disorder are also at increased risk for anxiety disorders and ma-\njor depressive disorder, and this seems largely attributable to the presence of the angry-\nirritable mood symptoms. Adolescents and adults with oppositional defiant disorder also\nshow a higher rate of substance use disorders, although it is unclear if this association is in-\ndependent of the comorbidity with conduct disorder."}
{"Subcategory":"Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders","Code":"312.9 (F91.9)","Disorder":"Intermittent Explosive Disorder","Content":"Intermittent Explosive Disorder\nDiagnostic Criteria\n312.34 (F63.81)\nA. Recurrent behavioral outbursts representing a failure to control aggressive impulses\nas manifested by either of the following:\n1. Verbal aggression (e.g., temper tantrums, tirades, verbal arguments or fights) or\nphysical aggression toward property, animals, or other individuals, occurring twice\nweekly, on average, for a period of 3 months. The physical aggression does not re-\nsult in damage or destruction of property and does not result in physical injury to\nanimals or other individuals. \n2. Three behavioral outbursts involving damage or destruction of property and\/or\nphysical assault involving physical injury against animals or other individuals occur-\nring within a 12-month period. \nB. The magnitude of aggressiveness expressed during the recurrent outbursts is grossly\nout of proportion to the provocation or to any precipitating psychosocial stressors. \nC. The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not premeditated (i.e., they are impulsive and\/\nor anger-based) and are not committed to achieve some tangible objective (e.g.,\nmoney, power, intimidation).\nD. The recurrent aggressive outbursts cause either marked distress in the individual or\nimpairment in occupational or interpersonal functioning, or are associated with finan-\ncial or legal consequences. \nE. Chronological age is at least 6 years (or equivalent developmental level).\nF. The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not better explained by another mental disor-\nder (e.g., major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation\ndisorder, a psychotic disorder, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality\ndisorder) and are not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., head trauma, Alz-\nheimer’s disease) or to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse,\na medication). For children ages 6–18 years, aggressive behavior that occurs as part\nof an adjustment disorder should not be considered for this diagnosis. \nNote: This diagnosis can be made in addition to the diagnosis of attention-deficit\/hyper-\nactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or autism spectrum dis-\norder when recurrent impulsive aggressive outbursts are in excess of those usually seen\nin these disorders and warrant independent clinical attention.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe impulsive (or anger-based) aggressive outbursts in intermittent explosive disorder have\na rapid onset and, typically, little or no prodromal period. Outbursts typically last for less\nIntermittent Explosive Disorder\n467\nthan 30 minutes and commonly occur in response to a minor provocation by a close intimate\nor associate. Individuals with intermittent explosive disorder often have less severe epi-\nsodes of verbal and\/or nondamaging, nondestructive, or noninjurious physical assault (Cri-\nterion A1) in between more severe destructive\/assaultive episodes (Criterion A2). Criterion\nA1 defines frequent (i.e., twice weekly, on average, for a period of 3 months) aggressive out-\nbursts characterized by temper tantrums, tirades, verbal arguments or fights, or assault\nwithout damage to objects or without injury to animals or other individuals. Criterion A2\ndefines infrequent (i.e., three in a 1-year period) impulsive aggressive outbursts character-\nized by damaging or destroying an object, regardless of its tangible value, or by assaulting\/\nstriking or otherwise causing physical injury to an animal or to another individual. Regard-\nless of the nature of the impulsive aggressive outburst, the core feature of intermittent\nexplosive disorder is failure to control impulsive aggressive behavior in response to subjec-\ntively experienced provocation (i.e., psychosocial stressor) that would not typically result in\nan aggressive outburst (Criterion B). The aggressive outbursts are generally impulsive and\/\nor anger-based, rather than premeditated or instrumental (Criterion C) and are associated\nwith significant distress or impairment in psychosocial function (Criterion D). A diagnosis\nof intermittent explosive disorder should not be given to individuals younger than 6 years,\nor the equivalent developmental level (Criterion E), or to individuals whose aggressive out-\nbursts are better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion F). A diagnosis of intermit-\ntent explosive disorder should not be given to individuals with disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder or to individuals whose impulsive aggressive outbursts are attribut-\nable to another medical condition or to the physiological effects of a substance (Criterion F).\nIn addition, children ages 6–18 years should not receive this diagnosis when impulsive ag-\ngressive outbursts occur in the context of an adjustment disorder (Criterion F). \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis \nMood disorders (unipolar), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders are associated\nwith intermittent explosive disorder, although onset of these disorders is typically later\nthan that of intermittent explosive disorder. \nPrevalence\nOne-year prevalence data for intermittent explosive disorder in the United States is about\n2.7% (narrow definition). Intermittent explosive disorder is more prevalent among\nyounger individuals (e.g., younger than 35–40 years), compared with older individuals\n(older than 50 years), and in individuals with a high school education or less. \nDevelopment and Course\nThe onset of recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive behavior is most common in late\nchildhood or adolescence and rarely begins for the first time after age 40 years. The core\nfeatures of intermittent explosive disorder, typically, are persistent and continue for many\nyears.\nThe course of the disorder may be episodic, with recurrent periods of impulsive ag-\ngressive outbursts. Intermittent explosive disorder appears to follow a chronic and persis-\ntent course over many years. It also appears to be quite common regardless of the presence\nor absence of attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or disruptive, impulse-\ncontrol, and conduct disorders (e.g., conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder). \nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nEnvironmental.\nIndividuals with a history of physical and emotional trauma during the\nfirst two decades of life are at increased risk for intermittent explosive disorder. \n468\nDisruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders\nGenetic and physiological.\nFirst-degree relatives of individuals with intermittent ex-\nplosive disorder are at increased risk for intermittent explosive disorder, and twin studies\nhave demonstrated a substantial genetic influence for impulsive aggression. \nResearch provides neurobiological support for the presence of serotonergic abnormal-\nities, globally and in the brain, specifically in areas of the limbic system (anterior cingulate)\nand orbitofrontal cortex in individuals with intermittent explosive disorder. Amygdala\nresponses to anger stimuli, during functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning, are\ngreater in individuals with intermittent explosive disorder compared with healthy indi-\nviduals.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues \nThe lower prevalence of intermittent explosive disorder in some regions (Asia, Middle\nEast) or countries (Romania, Nigeria), compared with the United States, suggests that in-\nformation about recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive behaviors either is not elic-\nited on questioning or is less likely to be present, because of cultural factors.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nIn some studies the prevalence of intermittent explosive disorder is greater in males than\nin females (odds ratio = 1.4–2.3); other studies have found no gender difference. \nFunctional Consequences of \nIntermittent Explosive Disorder\nSocial (e.g., loss of friends, relatives, marital instability), occupational (e.g., demotion, loss\nof employment), financial (e.g., due to value of objects destroyed), and legal (e.g., civil\nsuits as a result of aggressive behavior against person or property; criminal charges for as-\nsault) problems often develop as a result of intermittent explosive disorder. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nA diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be made when Criteria A1 and\/\nor A2 are only met during an episode of another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive\ndisorder, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder), or when impulsive aggressive outbursts\nare attributable to another medical condition or to the physiological effects of a substance\nor medication. This diagnosis also should not be made, particularly in children and ado-\nlescents ages 6–18 years, when the impulsive aggressive outbursts occur in the context of\nan adjustment disorder. Other examples in which recurrent, problematic, impulsive ag-\ngressive outbursts may, or may not, be diagnosed as intermittent explosive disorder in-\nclude the following. \nDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder.\nIn contrast to intermittent explosive disorder,\ndisruptive mood dysregulation disorder is characterized by a persistently negative mood state\n(i.e., irritability, anger) most of the day, nearly every day, between impulsive aggressive out-\nbursts. A diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder can only be given when the on-\nset of recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive outbursts is before age 10 years. Finally, a\ndiagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be made for the first time\nafter age 18 years. Otherwise, these diagnoses are mutually exclusive. \nAntisocial personality disorder or borderline personality disorder.\nIndividuals with an-\ntisocial personality disorder or borderline personality disorder often display recurrent,\nproblematic impulsive aggressive outbursts. However, the level of impulsive aggression\nin individuals with antisocial personality disorder or borderline personality disorder is\nlower than that in individuals with intermittent explosive disorder.\nConduct Disorder\n469\nDelirium, major neurocognitive disorder, and personality change due to another med-\nical condition, aggressive type.\nA diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not\nbe made when aggressive outbursts are judged to result from the physiological effects of an-\nother diagnosable medical condition (e.g., brain injury associated with a change in personality\ncharacterized by aggressive outbursts; complex partial epilepsy). Nonspecific abnormalities\non neurological examination (e.g., “soft signs”) and nonspecific electroencephalographic\nchanges are compatible with a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder unless there is a di-\nagnosable medical condition that better explains the impulsive aggressive outbursts. \nSubstance intoxication or substance withdrawal.\nA diagnosis of intermittent explosive\ndisorder should not be made when impulsive aggressive outbursts are nearly always as-\nsociated with intoxication with or withdrawal from substances (e.g., alcohol, phencyclidine,\ncocaine and other stimulants, barbiturates, inhalants). However, when a sufficient number\nof impulsive aggressive outbursts also occur  in the absence of substance intoxication or\nwithdrawal, and these warrant independent clinical attention, a diagnosis of intermittent\nexplosive disorder may be given. \nAttention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disor-\nder, or autism spectrum disorder.\nIndividuals with any of these childhood-onset dis-\norders may exhibit impulsive aggressive outbursts. Individuals with ADHD are typically\nimpulsive and, as a result, may also exhibit impulsive aggressive outbursts. While indi-\nviduals with conduct disorder can exhibit impulsive aggressive outbursts, the form of ag-\ngression characterized by the diagnostic criteria is proactive and predatory. Aggression in\noppositional defiant disorder is typically characterized by temper tantrums and verbal ar-\nguments with authority figures, whereas impulsive aggressive outbursts in intermittent\nexplosive disorder are in response to a broader array of provocation and include physical\nassault. The level of impulsive aggression in individuals with a history of one or more of\nthese disorders has been reported as lower than that in comparable individuals whose\nsymptoms also meet intermittent explosive disorder Criteria A through E. Accordingly, if\nCriteria A through E are also met, and the impulsive aggressive outbursts warrant inde-\npendent clinical attention, a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder may be given. \nComorbidity\nDepressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders are most commonly\ncomorbid with intermittent explosive disorder. In addition, individuals with antisocial\npersonality disorder or borderline personality disorder, and individuals with a history of\ndisorders with disruptive behaviors (e.g., ADHD, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant\ndisorder), are at greater risk for comorbid intermittent explosive disorder."}

If the individual is age 18 years or older, criteria are not met for antisocial personality\ndisorder.\nSpecify whether:\n312.81 (F91.1) Childhood-onset type: Individuals show at least one symptom char-\nacteristic of conduct disorder prior to age 10 years.\n312.82 (F91.2) Adolescent-onset type: Individuals show no symptom characteristic\nof conduct disorder prior to age 10 years. \n312.89 (F91.9) Unspecified onset: Criteria for a diagnosis of conduct disorder are\nmet, but there is not enough information available to determine whether the onset of\nthe first symptom was before or after age 10 years. \nSpecify if:\nWith limited prosocial emotions: To qualify for this specifier, an individual must have dis-\nplayed at least two of the following characteristics persistently over at least 12 months and\nin multiple relationships and settings. These characteristics reflect the individual’s typical\npattern of interpersonal and emotional functioning over this period and not just occasional\noccurrences in some situations. Thus, to assess the criteria for the specifier, multiple infor-\nmation sources are necessary. In addition to the individual’s self-report, it is necessary to\nconsider reports by others who have known the individual for extended periods of time\n(e.g., parents, teachers, co-workers, extended family members, peers).\nLack of remorse or guilt: Does not feel bad or guilty when he or she does some-\nthing wrong (exclude remorse when expressed only when caught and\/or facing\npunishment). The individual shows a general lack of concern about the negative\nconsequences of his or her actions. For example, the individual is not remorseful\nafter hurting someone or does not care about the consequences of breaking rules.\nCallous—lack of empathy: Disregards and is unconcerned about the feelings of\nothers. The individual is described as cold and uncaring. The person appears more\nconcerned about the effects of his or her actions on himself or herself, rather than\ntheir effects on others, even when they result in substantial harm to others.\nConduct Disorder\n471\nUnconcerned about performance: Does not show concern about poor\/problem-\natic performance at school, at work, or in other important activities. The individual\ndoes not put forth the effort necessary to perform well, even when expectations are\nclear, and typically blames others for his or her poor performance.\nShallow or deficient affect: Does not express feelings or show emotions to others,\nexcept in ways that seem shallow, insincere, or superficial (e.g., actions contradict the\nemotion displayed; can turn emotions “on” or “off” quickly) or when emotional expres-\nsions are used for gain (e.g., emotions displayed to manipulate or intimidate others).\nSpecify current severity:\nMild: Few if any conduct problems in excess of those required to make the diagnosis\nare present, and conduct problems cause relatively minor harm to others (e.g., lying,\ntruancy, staying out after dark without permission, other rule breaking).\nModerate: The number of conduct problems and the effect on others are intermediate\nbetween those specified in “mild” and those in “severe” (e.g., stealing without confront-\ning a victim, vandalism).\nSevere: Many conduct problems in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are\npresent, or conduct problems cause considerable harm to others (e.g., forced sex, physical\ncruelty, use of a weapon, stealing while confronting a victim, breaking and entering).\nSubtypes\nThree subtypes of conduct disorder are provided based on the age at onset of the disorder.\nOnset is most accurately estimated with information from both the youth and the care-\ngiver; estimates are often 2 years later than actual onset. Both subtypes can occur in a mild,\nmoderate, or severe form. An unspecified-onset subtype is designated when there is in-\nsufficient information to determine age at onset.\nIn childhood-onset conduct disorder, individuals are usually male, frequently display\nphysical aggression toward others, have disturbed peer relationships, may have had op-\npositional defiant disorder during early childhood, and usually have symptoms that meet\nfull criteria for conduct disorder prior to puberty. Many children with this subtype also\nhave concurrent attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or other neurodevel-\nopmental difficulties. Individuals with childhood-onset type are more likely to have per-\nsistent conduct disorder into adulthood than are those with adolescent-onset type. As\ncompared with individuals with childhood-onset type, individuals with adolescent-onset\nconduct disorder are less likely to display aggressive behaviors and tend to have more\nnormative peer relationships (although they often display conduct problems in the com-\npany of others). These individuals are less likely to have conduct disorder that persists into\nadulthood. The ratio of males to females with conduct disorder is more balanced for the\nadolescent-onset type than for the childhood-onset type.\nSpecifiers\nA minority of individuals with conduct disorder exhibit characteristics that qualify for the\n“with limited prosocial emotions” specifier. The indicators of this specifier are those that\nhave often been labeled as callous and unemotional traits in research. Other personality\nfeatures, such as thrill seeking, fearlessness, and insensitivity to punishment, may also dis-\ntinguish those with characteristics described in the specifier. Individuals with character-\nistics described in this specifier may be more likely than other individuals with conduct\ndisorder to engage in aggression that is planned for instrumental gain. Individuals with\nconduct disorder of any subtype or any level of severity can have characteristics that qual-\nify for the specifier “with limited prosocial emotions,” although individuals with the spec-\nifier are more likely to have childhood-onset type and a severity specifier rating of severe.\n472\nDisruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders\nAlthough the validity of self-report to assess the presence of the specifier has been sup-\nported in some research contexts, individuals with conduct disorder with this specifier\nmay not readily admit to the traits in a clinical interview. Thus, to assess the criteria for the\nspecifier, multiple information sources are necessary. Also, because the indicators of the\nspecifier are characteristics that reflect the individual’s typical pattern of interpersonal and\nemotional functioning, it is important to consider reports by others who have known the\nindividual for extended periods of time and across relationships and settings (e.g., par-\nents, teachers, co-workers, extended family members, peers).\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of conduct disorder is a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior\nin which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are vi-\nolated (Criterion A). These behaviors fall into four main groupings: aggressive conduct\nthat causes or threatens physical harm to other people or animals (Criteria A1–A7); non-\naggressive conduct that causes property loss or damage (Criteria A8–A9); deceitfulness or\ntheft (Criteria A10–A12); and serious violations of rules (Criteria A13–A15). Three or more\ncharacteristic behaviors must have been present during the past 12 months, with at least\none behavior present in the past 6 months. The disturbance in behavior causes clinically\nsignificant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning (Criterion B). The\nbehavior pattern is usually present in a variety of settings, such as home, at school, or in\nthe community. Because individuals with conduct disorder are likely to minimize their\nconduct problems, the clinician often must rely on additional informants. However, infor-\nmants’ knowledge of the individual’s conduct problems may be limited if they have inad-\nequately supervised the individual or the individual has concealed symptom behaviors.\nIndividuals with conduct disorder often initiate aggressive behavior and react aggres-\nsively to others. They may display bullying, threatening, or intimidating behavior (includ-\ning bullying via messaging on Web-based social media) (Criterion A1); initiate frequent\nphysical fights (Criterion A2); use a weapon that can cause serious physical harm (e.g., a bat,\nbrick, broken bottle, knife, gun) (Criterion A3); be physically cruel to people (Criterion A4)\nor animals (Criterion A5); steal while confronting a victim (e.g., mugging, purse snatching,\nextortion, armed robbery) (Criterion A6); or force someone into sexual activity (Criterion A7).\nPhysical violence may take the form of rape, assault, or, in rare cases, homicide. Deliberate\ndestruction of others’ property may include deliberate fire setting with the intention of caus-\ning serious damage (Criterion A8) or deliberate destroying of other people’s property in\nother ways (e.g., smashing car windows, vandalizing school property) (Criterion A9). Acts of\ndeceitfulness or theft may include breaking into someone else’s house, building, or car (Crite-\nrion A10); frequently lying or breaking promises to obtain goods or favors or to avoid debts\nor obligations (e.g., “conning” other individuals) (Criterion A11); or stealing items of non-\ntrivial value without confronting the victim (e.g., shoplifting, forgery, fraud) (Criterion A12).\nIndividuals with conduct disorder may also frequently commit serious violations of\nrules (e.g., school, parental, workplace). Children with conduct disorder often have a pat-\ntern, beginning before age 13 years, of staying out late at night despite parental prohi-\nbitions (Criterion A13). Children may also show a pattern of running away from home\novernight (Criterion A14). To be considered a symptom of conduct disorder, the running\naway must have occurred at least twice (or only once if the individual did not return for a\nlengthy period). Runaway episodes that occur as a direct consequence of physical or sex-\nual abuse do not typically qualify for this criterion. Children with conduct disorder may\noften be truant from school, beginning prior to age 13 years (Criterion A15).\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nEspecially in ambiguous situations, aggressive individuals with conduct disorder fre-\nquently misperceive the intentions of others as more hostile and threatening than is the\nConduct Disorder\n473\ncase and respond with aggression that they then feel is reasonable and justified. Person-\nality features of trait negative emotionality and poor self-control, including poor frustra-\ntion tolerance, irritability, temper outbursts, suspiciousness, insensitivity to punishment,\nthrill seeking, and recklessness, frequently co-occur with conduct disorder. Substance\nmisuse is often an associated feature, particularly in adolescent females. Suicidal ideation,\nsuicide attempts, and completed suicide occur at a higher-than-expected rate in individu-\nals with conduct disorder. \nPrevalence\nOne-year population prevalence estimates range from 2% to more than 10%, with a median\nof 4%. The prevalence of conduct disorder appears to be fairly consistent across various\ncountries that differ in race and ethnicity. Prevalence rates rise from childhood to adoles-\ncence and are higher among males than among females. Few children with impairing con-\nduct disorder receive treatment.\nDevelopment and Course\nThe onset of conduct disorder may occur as early as the preschool years, but the first sig-\nnificant symptoms usually emerge during the period from middle childhood through\nmiddle adolescence. Oppositional defiant disorder is a common precursor to the child-\nhood-onset type of conduct disorder. Conduct disorder may be diagnosed in adults, how-\never, symptoms of conduct disorder usually emerge in childhood or adolescence, and\nonset is rare after age 16 years. The course of conduct disorder after onset is variable. In a\nmajority of individuals, the disorder remits by adulthood. Many individuals with conduct\ndisorder—particularly those with adolescent-onset type and those with few and milder\nsymptoms—achieve adequate social and occupational adjustment as adults. However, the\nearly-onset type predicts a worse prognosis and an increased risk of criminal behavior,\nconduct disorder, and substance-related disorders in adulthood. Individuals with conduct\ndisorder are at risk for later mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress dis-\norder, impulse-control disorders, psychotic disorders, somatic symptom disorders, and\nsubstance-related disorders as adults. \nSymptoms of the disorder vary with age as the individual develops increased physical\nstrength, cognitive abilities, and sexual maturity. Symptom behaviors that emerge first\ntend to be less serious (e.g., lying, shoplifting), whereas conduct problems that emerge last\ntend to be more severe (e.g., rape, theft while confronting a victim). However, there are\nwide differences among individuals, with some engaging in the more damaging behaviors\nat an early age (which is predictive of a worse prognosis). When individuals with conduct\ndisorder reach adulthood, symptoms of aggression, property destruction, deceitfulness,\nand rule violation, including violence against co-workers, partners, and children, may be ex-\nhibited in the workplace and the home, such that antisocial personality disorder may be\nconsidered. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nTemperamental.\nTemperamental risk factors include a difficult undercontrolled infant\ntemperament and lower-than-average intelligence, particularly with regard to verbal IQ.\nEnvironmental.\nFamily-level risk factors include parental rejection and neglect, inconsis-\ntent child-rearing practices, harsh discipline, physical or sexual abuse, lack of supervision,\nearly institutional living, frequent changes of caregivers, large family size, parental criminal-\nity, and certain kinds of familial psychopathology (e.g., substance-related disorders). Com-\nmunity-level risk factors include peer rejection, association with a delinquent peer group,\nand neighborhood exposure to violence. Both types of risk factors tend to be more common\nand severe among individuals with the childhood-onset subtype of conduct disorder. \n474\nDisruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders\nGenetic and physiological.\nConduct disorder is influenced by both genetic and envi-\nronmental factors. The risk is increased in children with a biological or adoptive parent or\na sibling with conduct disorder. The disorder also appears to be more common in children\nof biological parents with severe alcohol use disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, or\nschizophrenia or biological parents who have a history of ADHD or conduct disorder.\nFamily history particularly characterizes individuals with the childhood-onset subtype of\nconduct disorder. Slower resting heart rate has been reliably noted in individuals with\nconduct disorder compared with those without the disorder, and this marker is not char-\nacteristic of any other mental disorder. Reduced autonomic fear conditioning, particularly\nlow skin conductance, is also well documented. However, these psychophysiological find-\nings are not diagnostic of the disorder. Structural and functional differences in brain areas\nassociated with affect regulation and affect processing, particularly frontotemporal-limbic\nconnections involving the brain’s ventral prefrontal cortex and amygdala, have been con-\nsistently noted in individuals with conduct disorder compared with those without the dis-\norder. However, neuroimaging findings are not diagnostic of the disorder.\nCourse modifiers.\nPersistence is more likely for individuals with behaviors that meet\ncriteria for the childhood-onset subtype and qualify for the specifier “with limited pro-\nsocial emotions”. The risk that conduct disorder will persist is also increased by co-occurring\nADHD and by substance abuse. \nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nConduct disorder diagnosis may at times be potentially misapplied to individuals in set-\ntings where patterns of disruptive behavior are viewed as near-normative (e.g., in very\nthreatening, high-crime areas or war zones). Therefore, the context in which the undesir-\nable behaviors have occurred should be considered.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nMales with a diagnosis of conduct disorder frequently exhibit fighting, stealing, vandalism,\nand school discipline problems. Females with a diagnosis of conduct disorder are more likely\nto exhibit lying, truancy, running away, substance use, and prostitution. Whereas males tend\nto exhibit both physical aggression and relational aggression (behavior that harms social re-\nlationships of others), females tend to exhibit relatively more relational aggression.\nFunctional Consequences of Conduct Disorder \nConduct disorder behaviors may lead to school suspension or expulsion, problems in\nwork adjustment, legal difficulties, sexually transmitted diseases, unplanned pregnancy,\nand physical injury from accidents or fights. These problems may preclude attendance in\nordinary schools or living in a parental or foster home. Conduct disorder is often associ-\nated with an early onset of sexual behavior, alcohol use, tobacco smoking, use of illegal\nsubstances, and reckless and risk-taking acts. Accident rates appear to be higher among in-\ndividuals with conduct disorder compared with those without the disorder. These func-\ntional consequences of conduct disorder may predict health difficulties when individuals\nreach midlife. It is not uncommon for individuals with conduct disorder to come into con-\ntact with the criminal justice system for engaging in illegal behavior. Conduct disorder is\na common reason for treatment referral and is frequently diagnosed in mental health fa-\ncilities for children, especially in forensic practice. It is associated with impairment that is\nmore severe and chronic than that experienced by other clinic-referred children.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nOppositional defiant disorder.\nConduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder are\nboth related to symptoms that bring the individual in conflict with adults and other au-\nConduct Disorder\n475\nthority figures (e.g., parents, teachers, work supervisors). The behaviors of oppositional\ndefiant disorder are typically of a less severe nature than those of individuals with conduct\ndisorder and do not include aggression toward individuals or animals, destruction of\nproperty, or a pattern of theft or deceit. Furthermore, oppositional defiant disorder in-\ncludes problems of emotional dysregulation (i.e., angry and irritable mood) that are not in-\ncluded in the definition of conduct disorder. When criteria are met for both oppositional\ndefiant disorder and conduct disorder, both diagnoses can be given.\nAttention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder.\nAlthough children with ADHD often exhibit\nhyperactive and impulsive behavior that may be disruptive, this behavior does not by it-\nself violate societal norms or the rights of others and therefore does not usually meet cri-\nteria for conduct disorder. When criteria are met for both ADHD and conduct disorder, both\ndiagnoses should be given.\nDepressive and bipolar disorders.\nIrritability, aggression, and conduct problems can\noccur in children or adolescents with a major depressive disorder, a bipolar disorder, or\ndisruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The behaviorial problems associated with these\nmood disorders can usually be distinguished from the pattern of conduct problems seen in\nconduct disorder based on their course. Specifically, persons with conduct disorder will\ndisplay substantial levels of aggressive or non-aggressive conduct problems during peri-\nods in which there is no mood disturbance, either historically (i.e., a history of conduct\nproblems predating the onset of the mood disturbance) or concurrently (i.e., display of\nsome conduct problems that are premeditated and do not occur during periods of intense\nemotional arousal). In those cases in which criteria for conduct disorder and a mood dis-\norder are met, both diagnoses can be given. \nIntermittent explosive disorder.\nBoth conduct disorder and intermittent explosive dis-\norder involve high rates of aggression. However, the aggression in individuals with inter-\nmittent explosive disorder is limited to impulsive aggression and is not premeditated, and\nit is not committed in order to achieve some tangible objective (e.g., money, power, intim-\nidation). Also, the definition of intermittent explosive disorder does not include the non-\naggressive symptoms of conduct disorder. If criteria for both disorders are met, the diag-\nnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should be given only when the recurrent impul-\nsive aggressive outbursts warrant independent clinical attention. \nAdjustment disorders.\nThe diagnosis of an adjustment disorder (with disturbance of con-\nduct or with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct) should be considered if clinically\nsignificant conduct problems that do not meet the criteria for another specific disorder de-\nvelop in clear association with the onset of a psychosocial stressor and do not resolve within\n6 months of the termination of the stressor (or its consequences). Conduct disorder is diag-\nnosed only when the conduct problems represent a repetitive and persistent pattern that is\nassociated with impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning.\nComorbidity\nADHD and oppositional defiant disorder are both common in individuals with conduct\ndisorder, and this comorbid presentation predicts worse outcomes. Individuals who show\nthe personality features associated with antisocial personality disorder often violate the\nbasic rights of others or violate major age-appropriate societal norms, and as a result their\npattern of behavior often meets criteria for conduct disorder. Conduct disorder may also\nco-occur with one or more of the following mental disorders: specific learning disorder,\nanxiety disorders, depressive or bipolar disorders, and substance-related disorders. Aca-\ndemic achievement, particularly in reading and other verbal skills, is often below the level\nexpected on the basis of age and intelligence and may justify the additional diagnosis of\nspecific learning disorder or a communication disorder.\n476\nDisruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders\nAntisocial Personality Disorder\nCriteria and text for antisocial personality disorder can be found in the chapter “Person-\nality Disorders.” Because this disorder is closely connected to the spectrum of “external-\nizing” conduct disorders in this chapter, as well as to the disorders in the adjoining chapter\n“Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders,” it is dual coded here as well as in the chap-\nter “Personality Disorders.”"}

The fire setting is not better explained by conduct disorder, a manic episode, or anti-\nsocial personality disorder.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of pyromania is the presence of multiple episodes of deliberate and\npurposeful fire setting (Criterion A). Individuals with this disorder experience tension or af-\nfective arousal before setting a fire (Criterion B). There is a fascination with, interest in, cu-\nriosity about, or attraction to fire and its situational contexts (e.g., paraphernalia, uses,\nconsequences) (Criterion C). Individuals with this disorder are often regular “watchers” at\nfires in their neighborhoods, may set off false alarms, and derive pleasure from institutions,\nequipment, and personnel associated with fire. They may spend time at the local fire depart-\nment, set fires to be affiliated with the fire department, or even become firefighters. Individ-\nuals with this disorder experience pleasure, gratification, or relief when setting the fire,\nwitnessing its effects, or participating in its aftermath (Criterion D). The fire setting is not\ndone for monetary gain, as an expression of sociopolitical ideology, to conceal criminal ac-\ntivity, to express anger or vengeance, to improve one’s living circumstances, or in response\nto a delusion or a hallucination (Criterion E). The fire setting does not result from impaired\njudgment (e.g., in major neurocognitive disorder or intellectual disability [intellectual devel-\nopmental disorder]). The diagnosis is not made if the fire setting is better explained by con-\nduct disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial personality disorder (Criterion F).\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with pyromania may make considerable advance preparation for starting a\nfire. They may be indifferent to the consequences to life or property caused by the fire, or\nPyromania\n477\nthey may derive satisfaction from the resulting property destruction. The behaviors may\nlead to property damage, legal consequences, or injury or loss of life to the fire setter or to\nothers. Individuals who impulsively set fires (who may or may not have pyromania) often\nhave a current or past history of alcohol use disorder.\nPrevalence\nThe population prevalence of pyromania is not known. The lifetime prevalence of fire set-\nting, which is just one component of pyromania and not sufficient for a diagnosis by itself,\nwas reported as 1.13% in a population sample, but the most common comorbidities were\nantisocial personality disorder, substance use disorder, bipolar disorder, and pathological\ngambling (gambling disorder). In contrast, pyromania as a primary diagnosis appears to\nbe very rare. Among a sample of persons reaching the criminal system with repeated fire\nsetting, only 3.3% had symptoms that met full criteria for pyromania. \nDevelopment and Course\nThere are insufficient data to establish a typical age at onset of pyromania. The relation-\nship between fire setting in childhood and pyromania in adulthood has not been docu-\nmented. In individuals with pyromania, fire-setting incidents are episodic and may wax\nand wane in frequency. Longitudinal course is unknown. Although fire setting is a major\nproblem in children and adolescents (over 40% of those arrested for arson offenses in the\nUnited States are younger than 18 years), pyromania in childhood appears to be rare. Ju-\nvenile fire setting is usually associated with conduct disorder, attention-deficit\/hyperac-\ntivity disorder, or an adjustment disorder.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nPyromania occurs much more often in males, especially those with poorer social skills and\nlearning difficulties.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther causes of intentional fire setting.\nIt is important to rule out other causes of fire\nsetting before giving the diagnosis of pyromania. Intentional fire setting may occur for\nprofit, sabotage, or revenge; to conceal a crime; to make a political statement (e.g., an act of\nterrorism or protest); or to attract attention or recognition (e.g., setting a fire in order to dis-\ncover it and save the day). Fire setting may also occur as part of developmental experi-\nmentation in childhood (e.g., playing with matches, lighters, or fire). \nOther mental disorders.\nA separate diagnosis of pyromania is not given when fire set-\nting occurs as part of conduct disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial personality disorder,\nor if it occurs in response to a delusion or a hallucination (e.g., in schizophrenia) or is at-\ntributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition (e.g., epilepsy). The di-\nagnosis of pyromania should also not be given when fire setting results from impaired\njudgment associated with major neurocognitive disorder, intellectual disability, or sub-\nstance intoxication.\nComorbidity\nThere appears to be a high co-occurrence of substance use disorders, gambling disorder,\ndepressive and bipolar disorders, and other disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct dis-\norders with pyromania.\n478\nDisruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders"}
{"Subcategory":"Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders","Code":"312.32 (F63.3)","Disorder":"Kleptomania","Content":"Kleptomania\nDiagnostic Criteria\n312.32 (F63.2)\nA. Recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal objects that are not needed for personal\nuse or for their monetary value.\nB. Increasing sense of tension immediately before committing the theft.\nC. Pleasure, gratification, or relief at the time of committing the theft.\nD. The stealing is not committed to express anger or vengeance and is not in response\nto a delusion or a hallucination.\nE. The stealing is not better explained by conduct disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial\npersonality disorder.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of kleptomania is the recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal items\neven though the items are not needed for personal use or for their monetary value (Criterion\nA). The individual experiences a rising subjective sense of tension before the theft (Criterion B)\nand feels pleasure, gratification, or relief when committing the theft (Criterion C). The stealing\nis not committed to express anger or vengeance, is not done in response to a delusion or hal-\nlucination (Criterion D), and is not better explained by conduct disorder, a manic episode, or\nantisocial personality disorder (Criterion E). The objects are stolen despite the fact that they are\ntypically of little value to the individual, who could have afforded to pay for them and often\ngives them away or discards them. Occasionally the individual may hoard the stolen objects or\nsurreptitiously return them. Although individuals with this disorder will generally avoid\nstealing when immediate arrest is probable (e.g., in full view of a police officer), they usually\ndo not preplan the thefts or fully take into account the chances of apprehension. The stealing is\ndone without assistance from, or collaboration with, others.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with kleptomania typically attempt to resist the impulse to steal, and they are\naware that the act is wrong and senseless. The individual frequently fears being appre-\nhended and often feels depressed or guilty about the thefts. Neurotransmitter pathways\nassociated with behavioral addictions, including those associated with the serotonin, do-\npamine, and opioid systems, appear to play a role in kleptomania as well.\nPrevalence\nKleptomania occurs in about 4%–24% of individuals arrested for shoplifting. Its preva-\nlence in the general population is very rare, at approximately 0.3%–0.6%. Females outnum-\nber males at a ratio of 3:1.\nDevelopment and Course\nAge at onset of kleptomania is variable, but the disorder often begins in adolescence. How-\never, the disorder may begin in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood, and in rare cases\nin late adulthood. There is little systematic information on the course of kleptomania, but\nthree typical courses have been described: sporadic with brief episodes and long periods\nof remission; episodic with protracted periods of stealing and periods of remission; and\nchronic with some degree of fluctuation. The disorder may continue for years, despite\nmultiple convictions for shoplifting.\nOther Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder\n479\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nGenetic and physiological.\nThere are no controlled family history studies of kleptoma-\nnia. However, first-degree relatives of individuals with kleptomania may have higher\nrates of obsessive-compulsive disorder than the general population. There also appears to\nbe a higher rate of substance use disorders, including alcohol use disorder, in relatives of\nindividuals with kleptomania than in the general population. \nFunctional Consequences of Kleptomania\nThe disorder may cause legal, family, career, and personal difficulties.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nOrdinary theft.\nKleptomania should be distinguished from ordinary acts of theft or\nshoplifting. Ordinary theft (whether planned or impulsive) is deliberate and is motivated\nby the usefulness of the object or its monetary worth. Some individuals, especially adoles-\ncents, may also steal on a dare, as an act of rebellion, or as a rite of passage. The diagnosis\nis not made unless other characteristic features of kleptomania are also present. Klepto-\nmania is exceedingly rare, whereas shoplifting is relatively common. \nMalingering.\nIn malingering, individuals may simulate the symptoms of kleptomania to\navoid criminal prosecution. \nAntisocial personality disorder and conduct disorder.\nAntisocial personality disorder\nand conduct disorder are distinguished from kleptomania by a general pattern of antiso-\ncial behavior. \nManic episodes, psychotic episodes, and major neurocognitive disorder.\nKleptomania\nshould be distinguished from intentional or inadvertent stealing that may occur during a\nmanic episode, in response to delusions or hallucinations (as in, e.g., schizophrenia), or as\na result of a major neurocognitive disorder.\nComorbidity\nKleptomania may be associated with compulsive buying as well as with depressive and\nbipolar disorders (especially major depressive disorder), anxiety disorders, eating disor-\nders (particularly bulimia nervosa), personality disorders, substance use disorders (espe-\ncially alcohol use disorder), and other disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders."}
