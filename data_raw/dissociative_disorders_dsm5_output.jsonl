{"Subcategory":"Dissociative Disorders","Code":"300.14 (F44.81)","Disorder":"Dissociative Identity Disorder","Content":"Dissociative Identity Disorder\nDiagnostic Criteria\n300.14 (F44.81)\nA. Disruption of identity characterized by two or more distinct personality states, which\nmay be described in some cultures as an experience of possession. The disruption in\nidentity involves marked discontinuity in sense of self and sense of agency, accompa-\nnied by related alterations in affect, behavior, consciousness, memory, perception,\ncognition, and\/or sensory-motor functioning. These signs and symptoms may be ob-\nserved by others or reported by the individual. \nB. Recurrent gaps in the recall of everyday events, important personal information, and\/\nor traumatic events that are inconsistent with ordinary forgetting.\nC. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning. \nD. The disturbance is not a normal part of a broadly accepted cultural or religious practice.\nNote: In children, the symptoms are not better explained by imaginary playmates or\nother fantasy play.\nE. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,\nblackouts or chaotic behavior during alcohol intoxication) or another medical condition\n(e.g., complex partial seizures).\nDiagnostic Features \nThe defining feature of dissociative identity disorder is the presence of two or more dis-\ntinct personality states or an experience of possession (Criterion A). The overtness or\ncovertness of these personality states, however, varies as a function of psychological\nmotivation, current level of stress, culture, internal conflicts and dynamics, and emotional\nresilience. Sustained periods of identity disruption may occur when psychosocial pres-\nsures are severe and\/or prolonged. In many possession-form cases of dissociative identity\ndisorder, and in a small proportion of non-possession-form cases, manifestations of alter-\nnate identities are highly overt. Most individuals with non-possession-form dissociative\nidentity disorder do not overtly display their discontinuity of identity for long periods of\ntime; only a small minority present to clinical attention with observable alternation of\nDissociative Identity Disorder\n293\nidentities. When alternate personality states are not directly observed, the disorder can be\nidentified by two clusters of symptoms: 1) sudden alterations or discontinuities in sense of\nself and sense of agency (Criterion A), and 2) recurrent dissociative amnesias (Criterion B).\nCriterion A symptoms are related to discontinuities of experience that can affect any\naspect of an individual’s functioning. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder may\nreport the feeling that they have suddenly become depersonalized observers of their\n“own” speech and actions, which they may feel powerless to stop (sense of self). Such in-\ndividuals may also report perceptions of voices (e.g., a child’s voice; crying; the voice of a\nspiritual being). In some cases, voices are experienced as multiple, perplexing, indepen-\ndent thought streams over which the individual experiences no control. Strong emotions,\nimpulses, and even speech or other actions may suddenly emerge, without a sense of per-\nsonal ownership or control (sense of agency). These emotions and impulses are frequently\nreported as ego-dystonic and puzzling. Attitudes, outlooks, and personal preferences\n(e.g., about food, activities, dress) may suddenly shift and then shift back. Individuals may\nreport that their bodies feel different (e.g., like a small child, like the opposite gender, huge\nand muscular). Alterations in sense of self and loss of personal agency may be accompa-\nnied by a feeling that these attitudes, emotions, and behaviors—even one’s body—are\n“not mine” and\/or are “not under my control.” Although most Criterion A symptoms are\nsubjective, many of these sudden discontinuities in speech, affect, and behavior can be wit-\nnessed by family, friends, or the clinician. Non-epileptic seizures and other conversion\nsymptoms are prominent in some presentations of dissociative identity disorder, espe-\ncially in some non-Western settings.\nThe dissociative amnesia of individuals with dissociative identity disorder manifests in\nthree primary ways: as 1) gaps in remote memory of personal life events (e.g., periods of\nchildhood or adolescence; some important life events, such as the death of a grandparent,\ngetting married, giving birth); 2) lapses in dependable memory (e.g., of what happened\ntoday, of well-learned skills such as how to do their job, use a computer, read, drive); and\n3) discovery of evidence of their everyday actions and tasks that they do not recollect do-\ning (e.g., finding unexplained objects in their shopping bags or among their possessions;\nfinding perplexing writings or drawings that they must have created; discovering injuries;\n“coming to” in the midst of doing something). Dissociative fugues, wherein the person\ndiscovers dissociated travel, are common. Thus, individuals with dissociative identity dis-\norder may report that they have suddenly found themselves at the beach, at work, in a night-\nclub, or somewhere at home (e.g., in the closet, on a bed or sofa, in the corner) with no\nmemory of how they came to be there. Amnesia in individuals with dissociative identity dis-\norder is not limited to stressful or traumatic events; these individuals often cannot recall\neveryday events as well.\nIndividuals with dissociative identity disorder vary in their awareness and attitude to-\nward their amnesias. It is common for these individuals to minimize their amnestic symp-\ntoms. Some of their amnestic behaviors may be apparent to others—as when these persons\ndo not recall something they were witnessed to have done or said, when they cannot\nremember their own name, or when they do not recognize their spouse, children, or close\nfriends.\nPossession-form identities in dissociative identity disorder typically manifest as be-\nhaviors that appear as if a “spirit,” supernatural being, or outside person has taken control,\nsuch that the individual begins speaking or acting in a distinctly different manner. For ex-\nample, an individual’s behavior may give the appearance that her identity has been\nreplaced by the “ghost” of a girl who committed suicide in the same community years\nbefore, speaking and acting as though she were still alive. Or an individual may be “taken\nover” by a demon or deity, resulting in profound impairment, and demanding that the in-\ndividual or a relative be punished for a past act, followed by more subtle periods of iden-\ntity alteration. However, the majority of possession states around the world are normal,\nusually part of spiritual practice, and do not meet criteria for dissociative identity disor-\n294\nDissociative Disorders\nder. The identities that arise during possession-form dissociative identity disorder present\nrecurrently, are unwanted and involuntary, cause clinically significant distress or impair-\nment (Criterion C), and are not a normal part of a broadly accepted cultural or religious\npractice (Criterion D).\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis \nIndividuals with dissociative identity disorder typically present with comorbid depression,\nanxiety, substance abuse, self-injury, non-epileptic seizures, or another common symp-\ntom. They often conceal, or are not fully aware of, disruptions in consciousness, amnesia,\nor other dissociative symptoms. Many individuals with dissociative identity disorder re-\nport dissociative flashbacks during which they undergo a sensory reliving of a previous\nevent as though it were occurring in the present, often with a change of identity, a partial\nor complete loss of contact with or disorientation to current reality during the flashback,\nand a subsequent amnesia for the content of the flashback. Individuals with the disorder\ntypically report multiple types of interpersonal maltreatment during childhood and adult-\nhood. Nonmaltreatment forms of overwhelming early life events, such as multiple long,\npainful, early-life medical procedures, also may be reported. Self-mutilation and suicidal\nbehavior are frequent. On standardized measures, these individuals report higher levels\nof hypnotizability and dissociativity compared with other clinical groups and healthy con-\ntrol subjects. Some individuals experience transient psychotic phenomena or episodes.\nSeveral brain regions have been implicated in the pathophysiology of dissociative identity\ndisorder, including the orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and\namygdala.\nPrevalence\nThe 12-month prevalence of dissociative identity disorder among adults in a small U.S.\ncommunity study was 1.5%. The prevalence across genders in that study was 1.6% for\nmales and 1.4% for females. \nDevelopment and Course\nDissociative identity disorder is associated with overwhelming experiences, traumatic\nevents, and\/or abuse occurring in childhood. The full disorder may first manifest at al-\nmost any age (from earliest childhood to late life). Dissociation in children may generate\nproblems with memory, concentration, attachment, and traumatic play. Nevertheless, chil-\ndren usually do not present with identity changes; instead they present primarily with over-\nlap and interference among mental states (Criterion A phenomena), with symptoms related\nto discontinuities of experience. Sudden changes in identity during adolescence may ap-\npear to be just adolescent turmoil or the early stages of another mental disorder. Older\nindividuals may present to treatment with what appear to be late-life mood disorders, ob-\nsessive-compulsive disorder, paranoia, psychotic mood disorders, or even cognitive dis-\norders due to dissociative amnesia. In some cases, disruptive affects and memories may\nincreasingly intrude into awareness with advancing age. \nPsychological decompensation and overt changes in identity may be triggered by 1) re-\nmoval from the traumatizing situation (e.g., through leaving home); 2) the individual’s\nchildren reaching the same age at which the individual was originally abused or trauma-\ntized; 3) later traumatic experiences, even seemingly inconsequential ones, like a minor\nmotor vehicle accident; or 4) the death of, or the onset of a fatal illness in, their abuser(s).\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nEnvironmental.\nInterpersonal physical and sexual abuse is associated with an increased\nrisk of dissociative identity disorder. Prevalence of childhood abuse and neglect in the\nDissociative Identity Disorder\n295\nUnited States, Canada, and Europe among those with the disorder is about 90%. Other\nforms of traumatizing experiences, including childhood medical and surgical procedures,\nwar, childhood prostitution, and terrorism, have been reported.\nCourse modifiers.\nOngoing abuse, later-life retraumatization, comorbidity with mental\ndisorders, severe medical illness, and delay in appropriate treatment are associated with\npoorer prognosis.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues \nMany features of dissociative identity disorder can be influenced by the individual’s cul-\ntural background. Individuals with this disorder may present with prominent medically\nunexplained neurological symptoms, such as non-epileptic seizures, paralyses, or sensory\nloss, in cultural settings where such symptoms are common. Similarly, in settings where\nnormative possession is common (e.g., rural areas in the developing world, among certain\nreligious groups in the United States and Europe), the fragmented identities may take the\nform of possessing spirits, deities, demons, animals, or mythical figures. Acculturation or\nprolonged intercultural contact may shape the characteristics of the other identities (e.g.,\nidentities in India may speak English exclusively and wear Western clothes). Possession-\nform dissociative identity disorder can be distinguished from culturally accepted posses-\nsion states in that the former is involuntary, distressing, uncontrollable, and often recur-\nrent or persistent; involves conflict between the individual and his or her surrounding\nfamily, social, or work milieu; and is manifested at times and in places that violate the\nnorms of the culture or religion. \nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nFemales with dissociative identity disorder predominate in adult clinical settings but not\nin child clinical settings. Adult males with dissociative identity disorder may deny their\nsymptoms and trauma histories, and this can lead to elevated rates of false negative di-\nagnosis. Females with dissociative identity disorder present more frequently with acute\ndissociative states (e.g., flashbacks, amnesia, fugue, functional neurological [conversion]\nsymptoms, hallucinations, self-mutilation). Males commonly exhibit more criminal or vi-\nolent behavior than females; among males, common triggers of acute dissociative states in-\nclude combat, prison conditions, and physical or sexual assaults.\nSuicide Risk\nOver 70% of outpatients with dissociative identity disorder have attempted suicide; mul-\ntiple attempts are common, and other self-injurious behavior is frequent. Assessment of\nsuicide risk may be complicated when there is amnesia for past suicidal behavior or when\nthe presenting identity does not feel suicidal and is unaware that other dissociated iden-\ntities do. \nFunctional Consequences of \nDissociative Identity Disorder\nImpairment varies widely, from apparently minimal (e.g., in high-functioning profession-\nals) to profound. Regardless of level of disability, individuals with dissociative identity\ndisorder commonly minimize the impact of their dissociative and posttraumatic symp-\ntoms. The symptoms of higher-functioning individuals may impair their relational, mar-\nital, family, and parenting functions more than their occupational and professional life\n(although the latter also may be affected). With appropriate treatment, many impaired in-\ndividuals show marked improvement in occupational and personal functioning. How-\never, some remain highly impaired in most activities of living. These individuals may only\nrespond to treatment very slowly, with gradual reduction in or improved tolerance of\n296\nDissociative Disorders\ntheir dissociative and posttraumatic symptoms. Long-term supportive treatment may\nslowly increase these individuals’ ability to manage their symptoms and decrease use of\nmore restrictive levels of care. \nDifferential Diagnosis \nOther specified dissociative disorder.\nThe core of dissociative identity disorder is the\ndivision of identity, with recurrent disruption of conscious functioning and sense of self.\nThis central feature is shared with one form of other specified dissociative disorder, which\nmay be distinguished from dissociative identity disorder by the presence of chronic or re-\ncurrent mixed dissociative symptoms that do not meet Criterion A for dissociative identity\ndisorder or are not accompanied by recurrent amnesia.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nIndividuals with dissociative identity disorder are often de-\npressed, and their symptoms may appear to meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.\nRigorous assessment indicates that this depression in some cases does not meet full criteria for\nmajor depressive disorder. Other specified depressive disorder in individuals with dissocia-\ntive identity disorder often has an important feature: the depressed mood and cognitions fluc-\ntuate because they are experienced in some identity states but not others. \nBipolar disorders.\nIndividuals with dissociative identity disorder are often misdiag-\nnosed with a bipolar disorder, most often bipolar II disorder. The relatively rapid shifts in\nmood in individuals with this disorder—typically within minutes or hours, in contrast to\nthe slower mood changes typically seen in individuals with bipolar disorders—are due to\nthe rapid, subjective shifts in mood commonly reported across dissociative states, some-\ntimes accompanied by fluctuation in levels of activation. Furthermore, in dissociative\nidentity disorder, elevated or depressed mood may be displayed in conjunction with overt\nidentities, so one or the other mood may predominate for a relatively long period of time\n(often for days) or may shift within minutes.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder.\nSome traumatized individuals have both posttraumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD) and dissociative identity disorder. Accordingly, it is crucial to dis-\ntinguish between individuals with PTSD only and individuals who have both PTSD and\ndissociative identity disorder. This differential diagnosis requires that the clinician estab-\nlish the presence or absence of dissociative symptoms that are not characteristic of acute\nstress disorder or PTSD. Some individuals with PTSD manifest dissociative symptoms that\nalso occur in dissociative identity disorder: 1) amnesia for some aspects of trauma, 2) dis-\nsociative flashbacks (i.e., reliving of the trauma, with reduced awareness of one’s current\norientation), and 3) symptoms of intrusion and avoidance, negative alterations in cogni-\ntion and mood, and hyperarousal that are focused around the traumatic event. On the other\nhand, individuals with dissociative identity disorder manifest dissociative symptoms that\nare not a manifestation of PTSD: 1) amnesias for many everyday (i.e., nontraumatic) events,\n2) dissociative flashbacks that may be followed by amnesia for the content of the flashback,\n3) disruptive intrusions (unrelated to traumatic material) by dissociated identity states\ninto the individual’s sense of self and agency, and 4) infrequent, full-blown changes\namong different identity states.\nPsychotic disorders.\nDissociative identity disorder may be confused with schizophre-\nnia or other psychotic disorders. The personified, internally communicative inner voices\nof dissociative identity disorder, especially of a child (e.g., “I hear a little girl crying in a\ncloset and an angry man yelling at her”), may be mistaken for psychotic hallucinations.\nDissociative experiences of identity fragmentation or possession, and of perceived loss of\ncontrol over thoughts, feelings, impulses, and acts, may be confused with signs of formal\nthought disorder, such as thought insertion or withdrawal. Individuals with dissociative\nidentity disorder may also report visual, tactile, olfactory, gustatory, and somatic halluci-\nnations, which are usually related to posttraumatic and dissociative factors, such as partial\nDissociative Identity Disorder\n297\nflashbacks. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder experience these symptoms as\ncaused by alternate identities, do not have delusional explanations for the phenomena,\nand often describe the symptoms in a personified way (e.g., “I feel like someone else wants\nto cry with my eyes”). Persecutory and derogatory internal voices in dissociative identity\ndisorder associated with depressive symptoms may be misdiagnosed as major depression\nwith psychotic features. Chaotic identity change and acute intrusions that disrupt thought\nprocesses may be distinguished from brief psychotic disorder by the predominance of dis-\nsociative symptoms and amnesia for the episode, and diagnostic evaluation after cessation\nof the crisis can help confirm the diagnosis. \nSubstance\/medication-induced disorders.\nSymptoms associated with the physiological\neffects of a substance can be distinguished from dissociative identity disorder if the sub-\nstance in question is judged to be etiologically related to the disturbance.\nPersonality disorders.\nIndividuals with dissociative identity disorder often present identi-\nties that appear to encapsulate a variety of severe personality disorder features, suggesting a\ndifferential diagnosis of personality disorder, especially of the borderline type. Importantly,\nhowever, the individual’s longitudinal variability in personality style (due to inconsistency\namong identities) differs from the pervasive and persistent dysfunction in affect management\nand interpersonal relationships typical of those with personality disorders.\nConversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).\nThis disorder may be\ndistinguished from dissociative identity disorder by the absence of an identity disruption\ncharacterized by two or more distinct personality states or an experience of possession.\nDissociative amnesia in conversion disorder is more limited and circumscribed (e.g., am-\nnesia for a non-epileptic seizure).\nSeizure disorders.\nIndividuals with dissociative identity disorder may present with sei-\nzurelike symptoms and behaviors that resemble complex partial seizures with temporal\nlobe foci. These include déjà vu, jamais vu, depersonalization, derealization, out-of-body\nexperiences, amnesia, disruptions of consciousness, hallucinations, and other intrusion\nphenomena of sensation, affect, and thought. Normal electroencephalographic findings,\nincluding telemetry, differentiate non-epileptic seizures from the seizurelike symptoms of\ndissociative identity disorder. Also, individuals with dissociative identity disorder obtain\nvery high dissociation scores, whereas individuals with complex partial seizures do not.\nFactitious disorder and malingering.\nIndividuals who feign dissociative identity disor-\nder do not report the subtle symptoms of intrusion characteristic of the disorder; instead\nthey tend to overreport well-publicized symptoms of the disorder, such as dissociative\namnesia, while underreporting less-publicized comorbid symptoms, such as depression.\nIndividuals who feign dissociative identity disorder tend to be relatively undisturbed by\nor may even seem to enjoy “having” the disorder. In contrast, individuals with genuine\ndissociative identity disorder tend to be ashamed of and overwhelmed by their symptoms\nand to underreport their symptoms or deny their condition. Sequential observation, cor-\nroborating history, and intensive psychometric and psychological assessment may be\nhelpful in assessment.\nIndividuals who malinger dissociative identity disorder usually create limited, stereo-\ntyped alternate identities, with feigned amnesia, related to the events for which gain is\nsought. For example, they may present an “all-good” identity and an “all-bad” identity in\nhopes of gaining exculpation for a crime.\nComorbidity\nMany individuals with dissociative identity disorder present with a comorbid disorder. If\nnot assessed and treated specifically for the dissociative disorder, these individuals often\nreceive prolonged treatment for the comorbid diagnosis only, with limited overall treat-\nment response and resultant demoralization, and disability.\n298\nDissociative Disorders\nIndividuals with dissociative identity disorder usually exhibit a large number of co-\nmorbid disorders. In particular, most develop PTSD. Other disorders that are highly co-\nmorbid with dissociative identity disorder include depressive disorders, trauma- and\nstressor-related disorders, personality disorders (especially avoidant and borderline per-\nsonality disorders), conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder),\nsomatic symptom disorder, eating disorders, substance-related disorders, obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder, and sleep disorders. Dissociative alterations in identity, memory,\nand consciousness may affect the symptom presentation of comorbid disorders."}

The disturbance is not better explained by dissociative identity disorder, posttraumatic\nstress disorder, acute stress disorder, somatic symptom disorder, or major or mild neu-\nrocognitive disorder.\nCoding note: The code for dissociative amnesia without dissociative fugue is 300.12\n(F44.0). The code for dissociative amnesia with dissociative fugue is 300.13 (F44.1).\nSpecify if:\n300.13 (F44.1) With dissociative fugue: Apparently purposeful travel or bewildered\nwandering that is associated with amnesia for identity or for other important autobio-\ngraphical information.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe defining characteristic of dissociative amnesia is an inability to recall important auto-\nbiographical information that 1) should be successfully stored in memory and 2) ordinar-\nily would be readily remembered (Criterion A). Dissociative amnesia differs from the\npermanent amnesias due to neurobiological damage or toxicity that prevent memory stor-\nage or retrieval in that it is always potentially reversible because the memory has been suc-\ncessfully stored. \nLocalized amnesia, a failure to recall events during a circumscribed period of time, is the\nmost common form of dissociative amnesia. Localized amnesia may be broader than am-\nnesia for a single traumatic event (e.g., months or years associated with child abuse or in-\ntense combat). In selective amnesia, the individual can recall some, but not all, of the events\nduring a circumscribed period of time. Thus, the individual may remember part of a trau-\nmatic event but not other parts. Some individuals report both localized and selective am-\nnesias. \nGeneralized amnesia, a complete loss of memory for one’s life history, is rare. Individuals\nwith generalized amnesia may forget personal identity. Some lose previous knowledge\nabout the world (i.e., semantic knowledge) and can no longer access well-learned skills\nDissociative Amnesia\n299\n(i.e., procedural knowledge). Generalized amnesia has an acute onset; the perplexity, dis-\norientation, and purposeless wandering of individuals with generalized amnesia usually\nbring them to the attention of the police or psychiatric emergency services. Generalized\namnesia may be more common among combat veterans, sexual assault victims, and indi-\nviduals experiencing extreme emotional stress or conflict. \nIndividuals with dissociative amnesia are frequently unaware (or only partially aware)\nof their memory problems. Many, especially those with localized amnesia, minimize the\nimportance of their memory loss and may become uncomfortable when prompted to ad-\ndress it. In systematized amnesia, the individual loses memory for a specific category of in-\nformation (e.g., all memories relating to one’s family, a particular person, or childhood\nsexual abuse). In continuous amnesia, an individual forgets each new event as it occurs.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nMany individuals with dissociative amnesia are chronically impaired in their ability to\nform and sustain satisfactory relationships. Histories of trauma, child abuse, and victim-\nization are common. Some individuals with dissociative amnesia report dissociative flash-\nbacks (i.e., behavioral reexperiencing of traumatic events). Many have a history of self-\nmutilation, suicide attempts, and other high-risk behaviors. Depressive and functional\nneurological symptoms are common, as are depersonalization, auto-hypnotic symptoms,\nand high hypnotizability. Sexual dysfunctions are common. Mild traumatic brain injury\nmay precede dissociative amnesia. \nPrevalence\nThe 12-month prevalence for dissociative amnesia among adults in a small U.S. commu-\nnity study was 1.8% (1.0% for males; 2.6% for females). \nDevelopment and Course\nOnset of generalized amnesia is usually sudden. Less is known about the onset of localized\nand selective amnesias because these amnesias are seldom evident, even to the individual.\nAlthough overwhelming or intolerable events typically precede localized amnesia, its on-\nset may be delayed for hours, days, or longer. \nIndividuals may report multiple episodes of dissociative amnesia. A single episode\nmay predispose to future episodes. In between episodes of amnesia, the individual may or\nmay not appear to be acutely symptomatic. The duration of the forgotten events can range\nfrom minutes to decades. Some episodes of dissociative amnesia resolve rapidly (e.g.,\nwhen the person is removed from combat or some other stressful situation), whereas other\nepisodes persist for long periods of time. Some individuals may gradually recall the dis-\nsociated memories years later. Dissociative capacities may decline with age, but not al-\nways. As the amnesia remits, there may be considerable distress, suicidal behavior, and\nsymptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). \nDissociative amnesia has been observed in young children, adolescents, and adults.\nChildren may be the most difficult to evaluate because they often have difficulty under-\nstanding questions about amnesia, and interviewers may find it difficult to formulate child-\nfriendly questions about memory and amnesia. Observations of apparent dissociative am-\nnesia are often difficult to differentiate from inattention, absorption, anxiety, oppositional\nbehavior, and learning disorders. Reports from several different sources (e.g., teacher,\ntherapist, case worker) may be needed to diagnose amnesia in children. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nEnvironmental.\nSingle or repeated traumatic experiences (e.g., war, childhood maltreat-\nment, natural disaster, internment in concentration camps, genocide) are common ante-\n300\nDissociative Disorders\ncedents. Dissociative amnesia is more likely to occur with 1) a greater number of adverse\nchildhood experiences, particularly physical and\/or sexual abuse, 2) interpersonal vio-\nlence; and 3) increased severity, frequency, and violence of the trauma. \nGenetic and physiological.\nThere are no genetic studies of dissociative amnesia. Stud-\nies of dissociation report significant genetic and environmental factors in both clinical and\nnonclinical samples. \nCourse modifiers.\nRemoval from the traumatic circumstances underlying the dissociative\namnesia (e.g., combat) may bring about a rapid return of memory. The memory loss of indi-\nviduals with dissociative fugue may be particularly refractory. Onset of PTSD symptoms may\ndecrease localized, selective, or systematized amnesia. The returning memory, however, may\nbe experienced as flashbacks that alternate with amnesia for the content of the flashbacks. \nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nIn Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, non-epileptic seizures and other functional\nneurological symptoms may accompany dissociative amnesia. In cultures with highly re-\nstrictive social traditions, the precipitants of dissociative amnesia often do not involve\nfrank trauma. Instead, the amnesia is preceded by severe psychological stresses or con-\nflicts (e.g., marital conflict, other family disturbances, attachment problems, conflicts due\nto restriction or oppression). \nSuicide Risk\nSuicidal and other self-destructive behaviors are common in individuals with dissociative\namnesia. Suicidal behavior may be a particular risk when the amnesia remits suddenly\nand overwhelms the individual with intolerable memories.\nFunctional Consequences of Dissociative Amnesia \nThe impairment of individuals with localized, selective, or systematized dissociative am-\nnesia ranges from limited to severe. Individuals with chronic generalized dissociative am-\nnesia usually have impairment in all aspects of functioning. Even when these individuals\n“re-learn” aspects of their life history, autobiographical memory remains very impaired.\nMost become vocationally and interpersonally disabled. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nDissociative identity disorder.\nIndividuals with dissociative amnesia may report de-\npersonalization and auto-hypnotic symptoms. Individuals with dissociative identity dis-\norder report pervasive discontinuities in sense of self and agency, accompanied by many\nother dissociative symptoms. The amnesias of individuals with localized, selective, and\/\nor systematized dissociative amnesias are relatively stable. Amnesias in dissociative iden-\ntity disorder include amnesia for everyday events, finding of unexplained possessions,\nsudden fluctuations in skills and knowledge, major gaps in recall of life history, and brief\namnesic gaps in interpersonal interactions.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder.\nSome individuals with PTSD cannot recall part or all of\na specific traumatic event (e.g., a rape victim with depersonalization and\/or derealization\nsymptoms who cannot recall most events for the entire day of the rape). When that amne-\nsia extends beyond the immediate time of the trauma, a comorbid diagnosis of dissociative\namnesia is warranted. \nNeurocognitive disorders.\nIn neurocognitive disorders, memory loss for personal infor-\nmation is usually embedded in cognitive, linguistic, affective, attentional, and behavioral\nDissociative Amnesia\n301\ndisturbances. In dissociative amnesia, memory deficits are primarily for autobiographical\ninformation; intellectual and cognitive abilities are preserved. \nSubstance-related disorders.\nIn the context of repeated intoxication with alcohol or\nother substances\/medications, there may be episodes of “black outs” or periods for which the\nindividual has no memory. To aid in distinguishing these episodes from dissociative am-\nnesia, a longitudinal history noting that the amnestic episodes occur only in the context of\nintoxication and do not occur in other situations would help identify the source as sub-\nstance-induced; however the distinction may be difficult when the individual with dis-\nsociative amnesia may also misuse alcohol or other substances in the context of stressful\nsituations that may also exacerbate dissociative symptoms. Some individuals with comor-\nbid dissociative amnesia and substance use disorders will attribute their memory prob-\nlems solely to the substance use. Prolonged use of alcohol or other substances may result in\na substance-induced neurocognitive disorder that may be associated with impaired cog-\nnitive function, but in this context the protracted history of substance use and the persis-\ntent deficits associated with the neurocognitive disorder would serve to distinguish it\nfrom dissociative amnesia, where there is typically no evidence of persistent impairment in\nintellectual functioning.\nPosttraumatic amnesia due to brain injury.\nAmnesia may occur in the context of a trau-\nmatic brain injury (TBI) when there has been an impact to the head or other mechanisms of\nrapid movement or displacement of the brain within the skull TBI. Other characteristics of\nTBI include loss of consciousness, disorientation and confusion, or, in more severe cases,\nneurological signs (e.g., abnormalities on neuroimaging, a new onset of seizures or a marked\nworsening of a preexisting seizure disorder, visual field cuts, anosmia). A neurocognitive\ndisorder attributable to TBI must present either immediately after brain injury occurs or im-\nmediately after the individual recovers consciousness after the injury, and persist past the\nacute post-injury period. The cognitive presentation of a neurocognitive disorder following\nTBI is variable and includes difficulties in the domains of complex attention, executive func-\ntion, learning and memory as well as slowed speed of information processing and distur-\nbances in social cognition. These additional features help distinguish it from dissociative\namnesia. \nSeizure disorders.\nIndividuals with seizure disorders may exhibit complex behavior dur-\ning seizures or post-ictally with subsequent amnesia. Some individuals with a seizure disorder\nengage in nonpurposive wandering that is limited to the period of seizure activity. Con-\nversely, behavior during a dissociative fugue is usually purposeful, complex, and goal-\ndirected and may last for days, weeks, or longer. Occasionally, individuals with a seizure dis-\norder will report that earlier autobiographical memories have been “wiped out” as the seizure\ndisorder progresses. Such memory loss is not associated with traumatic circumstances and ap-\npears to occur randomly. Serial electroencephalograms usually show abnormalities. Telemet-\nric electroencephalographic monitoring usually shows an association between the episodes of\namnesia and seizure activity. Dissociative and epileptic amnesias may coexist.\nCatatonic stupor.\nMutism in catatonic stupor may suggest dissociative amnesia, but fail-\nure of recall is absent. Other catatonic symptoms (e.g., rigidity, posturing, negativism) are\nusually present.\nFactitious disorder and malingering.\nThere is no test, battery of tests, or set of procedures\nthat invariably distinguishes dissociative amnesia from feigned amnesia. Individuals with\nfactitious disorder or malingering have been noted to continue their deception even during\nhypnotic or barbiturate-facilitated interviews. Feigned amnesia is more common in individ-\nuals with 1) acute, florid dissociative amnesia; 2) financial, sexual, or legal problems; or 3) a\nwish to escape stressful circumstances. True amnesia can be associated with those same cir-\ncumstances. Many individuals who malinger confess spontaneously or when confronted. \n302\nDissociative Disorders\nNormal and age-related changes in memory.\nMemory decrements in major and mild\nneurocognitive disorders differ from those of dissociative amnesia, which are usually as-\nsociated with stressful events and are more specific, extensive, and\/or complex.\nComorbidity\nAs dissociative amnesia begins to remit, a wide variety of affective phenomena may sur-\nface: dysphoria, grief, rage, shame, guilt, psychological conflict and turmoil, and suicidal\nand homicidal ideation, impulses, and acts. These individuals may have symptoms that\nthen meet diagnostic criteria for persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia); major de-\npressive disorder; other specified or unspecified depressive disorder; adjustment disor-\nder, with depressed mood; or adjustment disorder, with mixed disturbance of emotions\nand conduct. Many individuals with dissociative amnesia develop PTSD at some point\nduring their life, especially when the traumatic antecedents of their amnesia are brought\ninto conscious awareness. \nMany individuals with dissociative amnesia have symptoms that meet diagnostic cri-\nteria for a comorbid somatic symptom or related disorder (and vice versa), including so-\nmatic symptom disorder and conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom\ndisorder). Many individuals with dissociative amnesia have symptoms that meet diagnos-\ntic criteria for a personality disorder, especially dependent, avoidant, and borderline."}
{"Subcategory":"Dissociative Disorders","Code":"300.6 (F48.1)","Disorder":"Depersonalization\/Derealization Disorder","Content":"Depersonalization\/Derealization Disorder\nDiagnostic Criteria\n300.6 (F48.1)\nA. The presence of persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealiza-\ntion, or both:\n1. Depersonalization: Experiences of unreality, detachment, or being an outside ob-\nserver with respect to one’s thoughts, feelings, sensations, body, or actions (e.g.,\nperceptual alterations, distorted sense of time, unreal or absent self, emotional and\/\nor physical numbing).\n2. Derealization: Experiences of unreality or detachment with respect to surround-\nings (e.g., individuals or objects are experienced as unreal, dreamlike, foggy, life-\nless, or visually distorted).\nB. During the depersonalization or derealization experiences, reality testing remains intact.\nC. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning.\nD. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a\ndrug of abuse, medication) or another medical condition (e.g., seizures).\nE. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as schizo-\nphrenia, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, acute stress disorder, posttrau-\nmatic stress disorder, or another dissociative disorder.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential features of depersonalization\/derealization disorder are persistent or recur-\nrent episodes of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Episodes of depersonalization\nare characterized by a feeling of unreality or detachment from, or unfamiliarity with, one’s\nwhole self or from aspects of the self (Criterion A1). The individual may feel detached\nfrom his or her entire being (e.g., “I am no one,” “I have no self”). He or she may also feel\nsubjectively detached from aspects of the self, including feelings (e.g., hypoemotionality:\nDepersonalization\/Derealization Disorder\n303\n“I know I have feelings but I don’t feel them”), thoughts (e.g., “My thoughts don’t feel like\nmy own,” “head filled with cotton”), whole body or body parts, or sensations (e.g., touch,\nproprioception, hunger, thirst, libido). There may also be a diminished sense of agency\n(e.g., feeling robotic, like an automaton; lacking control of one’s speech or movements).\nThe depersonalization experience can sometimes be one of a split self, with one part ob-\nserving and one participating, known as an “out-of-body experience” in its most extreme\nform. The unitary symptom of “depersonalization” consists of several symptom factors:\nanomalous body experiences (i.e., unreality of the self and perceptual alterations); emo-\ntional or physical numbing; and temporal distortions with anomalous subjective recall. \nEpisodes of derealization are characterized by a feeling of unreality or detachment\nfrom, or unfamiliarity with, the world, be it individuals, inanimate objects, or all surround-\nings (Criterion A2). The individual may feel as if he or she were in a fog, dream, or bubble, or\nas if there were a veil or a glass wall between the individual and world around. Surround-\nings may be experienced as artificial, colorless, or lifeless. Derealization is commonly ac-\ncompanied by subjective visual distortions, such as blurriness, heightened acuity, widened\nor narrowed visual field, two-dimensionality or flatness, exaggerated three-dimensional-\nity, or altered distance or size of objects (i.e., macropsia or micropsia). Auditory distortions\ncan also occur, whereby voices or sounds are muted or heightened. In addition, Criterion\nC requires the presence of clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning, and Criteria D and E describe exclusionary\ndiagnoses. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with depersonalization\/derealization disorder may have difficulty describ-\ning their symptoms and may think they are “crazy” or “going crazy”. Another common\nexperience is the fear of irreversible brain damage. A commonly associated symptom is a\nsubjectively altered sense of time (i.e., too fast or too slow), as well as a subjective difficulty\nin vividly recalling past memories and owning them as personal and emotional. Vague so-\nmatic symptoms, such as head fullness, tingling, or lightheadedness, are not uncommon.\nIndividuals may suffer extreme rumination or obsessional preoccupation (e.g., constantly\nobsessing about whether they really exist, or checking their perceptions to determine\nwhether they appear real). Varying degrees of anxiety and depression are also common as-\nsociated features. Individuals with the disorder have been found to have physiological\nhyporeactivity to emotional stimuli. Neural substrates of interest include the hypotha-\nlamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, inferior parietal lobule, and prefrontal cortical-limbic\ncircuits.\nPrevalence\nTransient depersonalization\/derealization symptoms lasting hours to days are common\nin the general population. The 12-month prevalence of depersonalization\/derealization\ndisorder is thought to be markedly less than for transient symptoms, although precise es-\ntimates for the disorder are unavailable. In general, approximately one-half of all adults\nhave experienced at least one lifetime episode of depersonalization\/derealization. How-\never, symptomatology that meets full criteria for depersonalization\/derealization disor-\nder is markedly less common than transient symptoms. Lifetime prevalence in U.S. and\nnon-U.S. countries is approximately 2% (range of 0.8% to 2.8%). The gender ratio for the\ndisorder is 1:1.\nDevelopment and Course\nThe mean age at onset of depersonalization\/derealization disorder is 16 years, although the\ndisorder can start in early or middle childhood; a minority cannot recall ever not having had\n304\nDissociative Disorders\nthe symptoms. Less than 20% of individuals experience onset after age 20 years and only\n5% after age 25 years. Onset in the fourth decade of life or later is highly unusual. Onset can\nrange from extremely sudden to gradual. Duration of depersonalization\/derealization\ndisorder episodes can vary greatly, from brief (hours or days) to prolonged (weeks,\nmonths, or years). Given the rarity of disorder onset after age 40 years, in such cases the in-\ndividual should be examined more closely for underlying medical conditions (e.g., brain\nlesions, seizure disorders, sleep apnea). The course of the disorder is often persistent.\nAbout one-third of cases involve discrete episodes; another third, continuous symptoms\nfrom the start; and still another third, an initially episodic course that eventually becomes\ncontinuous. \nWhile in some individuals the intensity of symptoms can wax and wane considerably,\nothers report an unwavering level of intensity that in extreme cases can be constantly pres-\nent for years or decades. Internal and external factors that affect symptom intensity vary\nbetween individuals, yet some typical patterns are reported. Exacerbations can be trig-\ngered by stress, worsening mood or anxiety symptoms, novel or overstimulating settings,\nand physical factors such as lighting or lack of sleep. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nTemperamental.\nIndividuals with depersonalization\/derealization disorder are charac-\nterized by harm-avoidant temperament, immature defenses, and both disconnection and\noverconnection schemata. Immature defenses such as idealization\/devaluation, projec-\ntion and acting out result in denial of reality and poor adaptation. Cognitive disconnection\nschemata reflect defectiveness and emotional inhibition and subsume themes of abuse, ne-\nglect, and deprivation. Overconnection schemata involve impaired autonomy with themes\nof dependency, vulnerability, and incompetence.\nEnvironmental.\nThere is a clear association between the disorder and childhood interper-\nsonal traumas in a substantial portion of individuals, although this association is not as prev-\nalent or as extreme in the nature of the traumas as in other dissociative disorders, such as\ndissociative identity disorder. In particular, emotional abuse and emotional neglect have been\nmost strongly and consistently associated with the disorder. Other stressors can include phys-\nical abuse; witnessing domestic violence; growing up with a seriously impaired, mentally ill\nparent; or unexpected death or suicide of a family member or close friend. Sexual abuse is a\nmuch less common antecedent but can be encountered. The most common proximal precipi-\ntants of the disorder are severe stress (interpersonal, financial, occupational), depression, anx-\niety (particularly panic attacks), and illicit drug use. Symptoms may be specifically induced by\nsubstances such as tetrahydrocannabinol, hallucinogens, ketamine, MDMA (3,4-methylene-\ndioxymethamphetamine; “ecstasy”) and salvia. Marijuana use may precipitate new-onset\npanic attacks and depersonalization\/derealization symptoms simultaneously.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nVolitionally induced experiences of depersonalization\/derealization can be a part of med-\nitative practices that are prevalent in many religions and cultures and should not be diag-\nnosed as a disorder. However, there are individuals who initially induce these states\nintentionally but over time lose control over them and may develop a fear and aversion for\nrelated practices. \nFunctional Consequences of \nDepersonalization\/Derealization Disorder\nSymptoms of depersonalization\/derealization disorder are highly distressing and are as-\nsociated with major morbidity. The affectively flattened and robotic demeanor that these\nDepersonalization\/Derealization Disorder\n305\nindividuals often demonstrate may appear incongruent with the extreme emotional pain\nreported by those with the disorder. Impairment is often experienced in both interpersonal\nand occupational spheres, largely due to the hypoemotionality with others, subjective diffi-\nculty in focusing and retaining information, and a general sense of disconnectedness from\nlife. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nIllness anxiety disorder.\nAlthough individuals with depersonalization\/derealization dis-\norder can present with vague somatic complaints as well as fears of permanent brain dam-\nage, the diagnosis of depersonalization\/derealization disorder is characterized by the\npresence of a constellation of typical depersonalization\/derealization symptoms and the ab-\nsence of other manifestations of illness anxiety disorder. \nMajor depressive disorder.\nFeelings of numbness, deadness, apathy, and being in a\ndream are not uncommon in major depressive episodes. However, in depersonalization\/\nderealization disorder, such symptoms are associated with further symptoms of the dis-\norder. If the depersonalization\/derealization clearly precedes the onset of a major depres-\nsive episode or clearly continues after its resolution, the diagnosis of depersonalization\/\nderealization disorder applies. \nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nSome individuals with depersonalization\/dereal-\nization disorder can become obsessively preoccupied with their subjective experience or\ndevelop rituals checking on the status of their symptoms. However, other symptoms of\nobsessive-compulsive disorder unrelated to depersonalization\/derealization are not\npresent. \nOther dissociative disorders.\nIn order to diagnose depersonalization\/derealization\ndisorder, the symptoms should not occur in the context of another dissociative disorder,\nsuch as dissociative identity disorder. Differentiation from dissociative amnesia and con-\nversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder) is simpler, as the symptoms\nof these disorders do not overlap with those of depersonalization\/derealization disorder. \nAnxiety disorders.\nDepersonalization\/derealization is one of the symptoms of panic at-\ntacks, increasingly common as panic attack severity increases. Therefore, depersonal-\nization\/derealization disorder should not be diagnosed when the symptoms occur only\nduring panic attacks that are part of panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, or specific\nphobia. In addition, it is not uncommon for depersonalization\/derealization symptoms\nto first begin in the context of new-onset panic attacks or as panic disorder progresses and\nworsens. In such presentations, the diagnosis of depersonalization\/derealization disorder\ncan be made if 1) the depersonalization\/derealization component of the presentation is\nvery prominent from the start, clearly exceeding in duration and intensity the occurrence\nof actual panic attacks; or 2) the depersonalization\/derealization continues after panic dis-\norder has remitted or has been successfully treated. \nPsychotic disorders.\nThe presence of intact reality testing specifically regarding the\ndepersonalization\/derealization symptoms is essential to differentiating depersonal-\nization\/derealization disorder from psychotic disorders. Rarely, positive-symptom\nschizophrenia can pose a diagnostic challenge when nihilistic delusions are present. For\nexample, an individual may complain that he or she is dead or the world is not real; this\ncould be either a subjective experience that the individual knows is not true or a delusional\nconviction.\nSubstance\/medication-induced disorders.\nDepersonalization\/derealization associated\nwith the physiological effects of substances during acute intoxication or withdrawal is not\ndiagnosed as depersonalization\/derealization disorder. The most common precipitating\nsubstances are the illicit drugs marijuana, hallucinogens, ketamine, ecstasy, and salvia. In\n306\nDissociative Disorders\nabout 15% of all cases of depersonalization\/derealization disorder, the symptoms are pre-\ncipitated by ingestion of such substances. If the symptoms persist for some time in the ab-\nsence of any further substance or medication use, the diagnosis of depersonalization\/\nderealization disorder applies. This diagnosis is usually easy to establish since the vast ma-\njority of individuals with this presentation become highly phobic and aversive to the trig-\ngering substance and do not use it again.\nMental disorders due to another medical condition.\nFeatures such as onset after age\n40 years or the presence of atypical symptoms and course in any individual suggest the\npossibility of an underlying medical condition. In such cases, it is essential to conduct a\nthorough medical and neurological evaluation, which may include standard laboratory\nstudies, viral titers, an electroencephalogram, vestibular testing, visual testing, sleep stud-\nies, and\/or brain imaging. When the suspicion of an underlying seizure disorder proves\ndifficult to confirm, an ambulatory electroencephalogram may be indicated; although\ntemporal lobe epilepsy is most commonly implicated, parietal and frontal lobe epilepsy\nmay also be associated.\nComorbidity\nIn a convenience sample of adults recruited for a number of depersonalization research\nstudies, lifetime comorbidities were high for unipolar depressive disorder and for any\nanxiety disorder, with a significant proportion of the sample having both disorders. Comor-\nbidity with posttraumatic stress disorder was low. The three most commonly co-occurring\npersonality disorders were avoidant, borderline, and obsessive-compulsive."}
