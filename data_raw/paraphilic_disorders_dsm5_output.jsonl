If disclosing individuals also report dis-\ntress or psychosocial problems because of their voyeuristic sexual preferences, they could be\ndiagnosed with voyeuristic disorder. On the other hand, if they declare no distress, demon-\nstrated by lack of anxiety, obsessions, guilt, or shame, about these paraphilic impulses and are\nnot impaired in other important areas of functioning because of this sexual interest, and their\npsychiatric or legal histories indicate that they do not act on it, they could be ascertained as\nhaving voyeuristic sexual interest but should not be diagnosed with voyeuristic disorder. \nNondisclosing individuals include, for example, individuals known to have been spy-\ning repeatedly on unsuspecting persons who are naked or engaging in sexual activity on\nseparate occasions but who deny any urges or fantasies concerning such sexual behavior,\nand who may report that known episodes of watching unsuspecting naked or sexually ac-\ntive persons were all accidental and nonsexual. Others may disclose past episodes of ob-\nserving unsuspecting naked or sexually active persons but contest any significant or\nsustained sexual interest in this behavior. Since these individuals deny having fantasies or\nimpulses about watching others nude or involved in sexual activity, it follows that they\nwould also reject feeling subjectively distressed or socially impaired by such impulses. De-\nspite their nondisclosing stance, such individuals may be diagnosed with voyeuristic dis-\norder. Recurrent voyeuristic behavior constitutes sufficient support for voyeurism (by\nfulfilling Criterion A) and simultaneously demonstrates that this paraphilically motivated\nbehavior is causing harm to others (by fulfilling Criterion B).\n“Recurrent” spying on unsuspecting persons who are naked or engaging in sexual ac-\ntivity (i.e., multiple victims, each on a separate occasion) may, as a general rule, be inter-\npreted as three or more victims on separate occasions. Fewer victims can be interpreted as\nsatisfying this criterion if there were multiple occasions of watching the same victim or if\nthere is corroborating evidence of a distinct or preferential interest in secret watching of\nnaked or sexually active unsuspecting persons. Note that multiple victims, as suggested\nearlier, are a sufficient but not a necessary condition for diagnosis; the criteria may also be\nmet if the individual acknowledges intense voyeuristic sexual interest. \nThe Criterion A time frame, indicating that signs or symptoms of voyeurism must have\npersisted for at least 6 months, should also be understood as a general guideline, not a\nstrict threshold, to ensure that the sexual interest in secretly watching unsuspecting naked\nor sexually active others is not merely transient. \nAdolescence and puberty generally increase sexual curiosity and activity. To alleviate\nthe risk of pathologizing normative sexual interest and behavior during pubertal adoles-\ncence, the minimum age for the diagnosis of voyeuristic disorder is 18 years (Criterion C).\nPrevalence\nVoyeuristic acts are the most common of potentially law-breaking sexual behaviors. The\npopulation prevalence of voyeuristic disorder is unknown. However, based on voyeuris-\n688\nParaphilic Disorders\ntic sexual acts in nonclinical samples, the highest possible lifetime prevalence for voyeuris-\ntic disorder is approximately 12% in males and 4% in females.\nDevelopment and Course\nAdult males with voyeuristic disorder often first become aware of their sexual interest in\nsecretly watching unsuspecting persons during adolescence. However, the minimum age\nfor a diagnosis of voyeuristic disorder is 18 years because there is substantial difficulty in\ndifferentiating it from age-appropriate puberty-related sexual curiosity and activity. The\npersistence of voyeurism over time is unclear. Voyeuristic disorder, however, per defini-\ntion requires one or more contributing factors that may change over time with or without\ntreatment: subjective distress (e.g., guilt, shame, intense sexual frustration, loneliness),\npsychiatric morbidity, hypersexuality, and sexual impulsivity; psychosocial impairment;\nand\/or the propensity to act out sexually by spying on unsuspecting naked or sexually ac-\ntive persons. Therefore, the course of voyeuristic disorder is likely to vary with age.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nTemperamental.\nVoyeurism is a necessary precondition for voyeuristic disorder; hence,\nrisk factors for voyeurism should also increase the rate of voyeuristic disorder.\nEnvironmental.\nChildhood sexual abuse, substance misuse, and sexual preoccupation\/\nhypersexuality have been suggested as risk factors, although the causal relationship to\nvoyeurism is uncertain and the specificity unclear. \nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nVoyeuristic disorder is very uncommon among females in clinical settings, while the male-\nto-female ratio for single sexually arousing voyeuristic acts might be 3:1.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nConduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder.\nConduct disorder in adolescents\nand antisocial personality disorder would be characterized by additional norm-breaking\nand antisocial behaviors, and the specific sexual interest in secretly watching unsuspect-\ning others who are naked or engaging in sexual activity should be lacking. \nSubstance use disorders.\nSubstance use disorders might involve single voyeuristic ep-\nisodes by intoxicated individuals but should not involve the typical sexual interest in se-\ncretly watching unsuspecting persons being naked or engaging in sexual activity. Hence,\nrecurrent voyeuristic sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors that occur also when the indi-\nvidual is not intoxicated suggest that voyeuristic disorder might be present.\nComorbidity\nKnown comorbidities in voyeuristic disorder are largely based on research with males\nsuspected of or convicted for acts involving the secret watching of unsuspecting nude or\nsexually active persons. Hence, these comorbidities might not apply to all individuals with\nvoyeuristic disorder. Conditions that occur comorbidly with voyeuristic disorder include\nhypersexuality and other paraphilic disorders, particularly exhibitionistic disorder. De-\npressive, bipolar, anxiety, and substance use disorders; attention-deficit\/hyperactivity\ndisorder; and conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder are also frequent co-\nmorbid conditions.\nExhibitionistic Disorder\n689"}

The non-\nconsenting individuals could be prepubescent children, adults, or both. This specifier should\nhelp draw adequate attention to characteristics of victims of individuals with exhibitionistic\ndisorder to prevent co-occurring pedophilic disorder from being overlooked. However, indi-\ncations that the individual with exhibitionistic disorder is sexually attracted to exposing his or\nher genitals to children should not preclude a diagnosis of pedophilic disorder.\nSpecifiers\nThe “in full remission” specifier does not address the continued presence or absence of ex-\nhibitionism per se, which may still be present after behaviors and distress have remitted. \nDiagnostic Features\nThe diagnostic criteria for exhibitionistic disorder can apply both to individuals who more or\nless freely disclose this paraphilia and to those who categorically deny any sexual attraction to\nexposing their genitals to unsuspecting persons despite substantial objective evidence to the\ncontrary. If disclosing individuals also report psychosocial difficulties because of their sexual\nattractions or preferences for exposing, they may be diagnosed with exhibitionistic disorder. In\ncontrast, if they declare no distress (exemplified by absence of anxiety, obsessions, and guilt or\nshame about these paraphilic impulses) and are not impaired by this sexual interest in other\nimportant areas of functioning, and their self-reported, psychiatric, or legal histories indicate\nthat they do not act on them, they could be ascertained as having exhibitionistic sexual interest\nbut not be diagnosed with exhibitionistic disorder. \nExamples of nondisclosing individuals include those who have exposed themselves\nrepeatedly to unsuspecting persons on separate occasions but who deny any urges or fan-\n690\nParaphilic Disorders\ntasies about such sexual behavior and who report that known episodes of exposure were\nall accidental and nonsexual. Others may disclose past episodes of sexual behavior involv-\ning genital exposure but refute any significant or sustained sexual interest in such behav-\nior. Since these individuals deny having urges or fantasies involving genital exposure, it\nfollows that they would also deny feeling subjectively distressed or socially impaired by\nsuch impulses. Such individuals may be diagnosed with exhibitionistic disorder despite\ntheir negative self-report. Recurrent exhibitionistic behavior constitutes sufficient support\nfor exhibitionism (Criterion A) and simultaneously demonstrates that this paraphilically\nmotivated behavior is causing harm to others (Criterion B).\n“Recurrent” genital exposure to unsuspecting others (i.e., multiple victims, each on a\nseparate occasion) may, as a general rule, be interpreted as three or more victims on sep-\narate occasions. Fewer victims can be interpreted as satisfying this criterion if there were\nmultiple occasions of exposure to the same victim, or if there is corroborating evidence of\na strong or preferential interest in genital exposure to unsuspecting persons. Note that\nmultiple victims, as suggested earlier, are a sufficient but not a necessary condition for di-\nagnosis, as criteria may be met by an individual’s acknowledging intense exhibitionistic\nsexual interest with distress and\/or impairment.\nThe Criterion A time frame, indicating that signs or symptoms of exhibitionism must\nhave persisted for at least 6 months, should also be understood as a general guideline, not\na strict threshold, to ensure that the sexual interest in exposing one’s genitals to unsuspect-\ning others is not merely transient. This might be expressed in clear evidence of repeated\nbehaviors or distress over a nontransient period shorter than 6 months. \nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of exhibitionistic disorder is unknown. However, based on exhibitionistic\nsexual acts in nonclinical or general populations, the highest possible prevalence for exhi-\nbitionistic disorder in the male population is 2%–4%. The prevalence of exhibitionistic dis-\norder in females is even more uncertain but is generally believed to be much lower than in\nmales. \nDevelopment and Course\nAdult males with exhibitionistic disorder often report that they first became aware of sex-\nual interest in exposing their genitals to unsuspecting persons during adolescence, at a\nsomewhat later time than the typical development of normative sexual interest in women\nor men. Although there is no minimum age requirement for the diagnosis of exhibitionis-\ntic disorder, it may be difficult to differentiate exhibitionistic behaviors from age-appro-\npriate sexual curiosity in adolescents. Whereas exhibitionistic impulses appear to emerge\nin adolescence or early adulthood, very little is known about persistence over time. By def-\ninition, exhibitionistic disorder requires one or more contributing factors, which may\nchange over time with or without treatment; subjective distress (e.g., guilt, shame, intense\nsexual frustration, loneliness), mental disorder comorbidity, hypersexuality, and sexual\nimpulsivity; psychosocial impairment; and\/or the propensity to act out sexually by expos-\ning the genitals to unsuspecting persons. Therefore, the course of exhibitionistic disorder\nis likely to vary with age. As with other sexual preferences, advancing age may be associ-\nated with decreasing exhibitionistic sexual preferences and behavior.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nTemperamental.\nSince exhibitionism is a necessary precondition for exhibitionistic dis-\norder, risk factors for exhibitionism should also increase the rate of exhibitionistic disor-\nder. Antisocial history, antisocial personality disorder, alcohol misuse, and pedophilic\nsexual preference might increase risk of sexual recidivism in exhibitionistic offenders.\nFrotteuristic Disorder\n691\nHence, antisocial personality disorder, alcohol use disorder, and pedophilic interest may\nbe considered risk factors for exhibitionistic disorder in males with exhibitionistic sexual\npreferences.\nEnvironmental.\nChildhood sexual and emotional abuse and sexual preoccupation\/hyper-\nsexuality have been suggested as risk factors for exhibitionism, although the causal rela-\ntionship to exhibitionism is uncertain and the specificity unclear. \nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nExhibitionistic disorder is highly unusual in females, whereas single sexually arousing ex-\nhibitionistic acts might occur up to half as often among women compared with men.\nFunctional Consequences of Exhibitionistic Disorder\nThe functional consequences of exhibitionistic disorder have not been addressed in re-\nsearch involving individuals who have not acted out sexually by exposing their genitals to\nunsuspecting strangers but who fulfill Criterion B by experiencing intense emotional dis-\ntress over these preferences.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nPotential differential diagnoses for exhibitionistic disorder sometimes occur also as co-\nmorbid disorders. Therefore, it is generally necessary to evaluate the evidence for exhibi-\ntionistic disorder and other possible conditions as separate questions. \nConduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder.\nConduct disorder in adolescents\nand antisocial personality disorder would be characterized by additional norm-breaking and\nantisocial behaviors, and the specific sexual interest in exposing the genitals should be lacking. \nSubstance use disorders.\nAlcohol and substance use disorders might involve single\nexhibitionistic episodes by intoxicated individuals but should not involve the typical sex-\nual interest in exposing the genitals to unsuspecting persons. Hence, recurrent exhibition-\nistic sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors that occur also when the individual is not\nintoxicated suggest that exhibitionistic disorder might be present.\nComorbidity\nKnown comorbidities in exhibitionistic disorder are largely based on research with indi-\nviduals (almost all males) convicted for criminal acts involving genital exposure to non-\nconsenting individuals. Hence, these comorbidities might not apply to all individuals who\nqualify for a diagnosis of exhibitionistic disorder. Conditions that occur comorbidly with\nexhibitionistic disorder at high rates include depressive, bipolar, anxiety, and substance\nuse disorders; hypersexuality; attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder; other paraphilic\ndisorders; and antisocial personality disorder."}

If disclosing individuals also report psychosocial impairment due to\ntheir sexual preferences for touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual, they\ncould be diagnosed with frotteuristic disorder.

Such individuals may re-\nport that identified episodes of touching or rubbing against an unwilling individual were\nall unintentional and nonsexual. Others may disclose past episodes of touching or rubbing\nagainst nonconsenting individuals but contest any major or persistent sexual interest in\nthis. Since these individuals deny having fantasies or impulses about touching or rubbing,\nthey would consequently reject feeling distressed or psychosocially impaired by such\nimpulses. Despite their nondisclosing position, such individuals may be diagnosed with\nfrotteuristic disorder.

Hence, the duration part of Criterion A may also be met if there is clear evidence of\nrecurrent behaviors or distress over a shorter but nontransient time period. \nPrevalence\nFrotteuristic acts, including the uninvited sexual touching of or rubbing against another\nindividual, may occur in up to 30% of adult males in the general population. Approximately\nFrotteuristic Disorder\n693\n10%–14% of adult males seen in outpatient settings for paraphilic disorders and hypersex-\nuality have a presentation that meets diagnostic criteria for frotteuristic disorder. Hence,\nwhereas the population prevalence of frotteuristic disorder is unknown, it is not likely that\nit exceeds the rate found in selected clinical settings. \nDevelopment and Course\nAdult males with frotteuristic disorder often report first becoming aware of their sexual in-\nterest in surreptitiously touching unsuspecting persons during late adolescence or emerging\nadulthood. However, children and adolescents may also touch or rub against unwilling oth-\ners in the absence of a diagnosis of frotteuristic disorder. Although there is no minimum age\nfor the diagnosis, frotteuristic disorder can be difficult to differentiate from conduct-disor-\ndered behavior without sexual motivation in individuals at younger ages. The persistence of\nfrotteurism over time is unclear. Frotteuristic disorder, however, by definition requires one\nor more contributing factors that may change over time with or without treatment: subjec-\ntive distress (e.g., guilt, shame, intense sexual frustration, loneliness); psychiatric morbidity;\nhypersexuality and sexual impulsivity; psychosocial impairment; and\/or the propensity to\nact out sexually by touching or rubbing against unconsenting persons. Therefore, the course\nof frotteuristic disorder is likely to vary with age. As with other sexual preferences, advanc-\ning age may be associated with decreasing frotteuristic sexual preferences and behavior. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nTemperamental.\nNonsexual antisocial behavior and sexual preoccupation\/hypersexuality\nmight be nonspecific risk factors, although the causal relationship to frotteurism is uncertain\nand the specificity unclear. However, frotteurism is a necessary precondition for frotteuristic\ndisorder, so risk factors for frotteurism should also increase the rate of frotteuristic disorder. \nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nThere appear to be substantially fewer females with frotteuristic sexual preferences than\nmales. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nConduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder.\nConduct disorder in adolescents\nand antisocial personality disorder would be characterized by additional norm-breaking\nand antisocial behaviors, and the specific sexual interest in touching or rubbing against a\nnonconsenting individual should be lacking. \nSubstance use disorders.\nSubstance use disorders, particularly those involving stimu-\nlants such as cocaine and amphetamines, might involve single frotteuristic episodes by in-\ntoxicated individuals but should not involve the typical sustained sexual interest in\ntouching or rubbing against unsuspecting persons.

If these individuals also re-\nport psychosocial difficulties because of their sexual attractions or preferences for being\nhumiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer, they may be diagnosed with sex-\nual masochism disorder. In contrast, if they declare no distress, exemplified by anxiety, ob-\nsessions, guilt, or shame, about these paraphilic impulses, and are not hampered by them\nin pursuing other personal goals, they could be ascertained as having masochistic sexual\ninterest but should not be diagnosed with sexual masochism disorder.\nThe Criterion A time frame, indicating that the signs or symptoms of sexual masoch-\nism must have persisted for at least 6 months, should be understood as a general guideline,\nnot a strict threshold, to ensure that the sexual interest in being humiliated, beaten, bound,\nor otherwise made to suffer is not merely transient. However, the disorder can be diag-\nnosed in the context of a clearly sustained but shorter time period.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nThe extensive use of pornography involving the act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or oth-\nerwise made to suffer is sometimes an associated feature of sexual masochism disorder.\nPrevalence\nThe population prevalence of sexual masochism disorder is unknown.

Very little is known about persistence over\ntime. Sexual masochism disorder per definition requires one or more contributing factors,\nwhich may change over time with or without treatment. These include subjective distress\n(e.g., guilt, shame, intense sexual frustration, loneliness), psychiatric morbidity, hypersex-\nuality and sexual impulsivity, and psychosocial impairment. Therefore, the course of sex-\nual masochism disorder is likely to vary with age. Advancing age is likely to have the same\nreducing effect on sexual preference involving sexual masochism as it has on other para-\nphilic or normophilic sexual behavior. \nFunctional Consequences of Sexual Masochism Disorder\nThe functional consequences of sexual masochism disorder are unknown. However, mas-\nochists are at risk of accidental death while practicing asphyxiophilia or other autoerotic\nprocedures. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nMany of the conditions that could be differential diagnoses for sexual masochism disorder\n(e.g., transvestic fetishism, sexual sadism disorder, hypersexuality, alcohol and substance\nuse disorders) sometimes occur also as comorbid diagnoses.

Individuals who openly acknowledge intense sexual interest in the\nphysical or psychological suffering of others are referred to as “admitting individuals.” If these\nindividuals also report psychosocial difficulties because of their sexual attractions or prefer-\nences for the physical or psychological suffering of another individual, they may be diagnosed\nwith sexual sadism disorder. In contrast, if admitting individuals declare no distress, exempli-\nfied by anxiety, obsessions, guilt, or shame, about these paraphilic impulses, and are not ham-\npered by them in pursuing other goals, and their self-reported, psychiatric, or legal histories\nindicate that they do not act on them, then they could be ascertained as having sadistic sexual\ninterest but they would not meet criteria for sexual sadism disorder.\nExamples of individuals who deny any interest in the physical or psychological suffering\nof another individual include individuals known to have inflicted pain or suffering on mul-\ntiple victims on separate occasions but who deny any urges or fantasies about such sexual\nbehavior and who may further claim that known episodes of sexual assault were either un-\nintentional or nonsexual. Others may admit past episodes of sexual behavior involving the\ninfliction of pain or suffering on a nonconsenting individual but do not report any significant\nor sustained sexual interest in the physical or psychological suffering of another individual.\nSince these individuals deny having urges or fantasies involving sexual arousal to pain and\nsuffering, it follows that they would also deny feeling subjectively distressed or socially im-\npaired by such impulses. Such individuals may be diagnosed with sexual sadism disorder\ndespite their negative self-report. Their recurrent behavior constitutes clinical support for\nthe presence of the paraphilia of sexual sadism (by satisfying Criterion A) and simultane-\nously demonstrates that their paraphilically motivated behavior is causing clinically signif-\nicant distress, harm, or risk of harm to others (satisfying Criterion B).\n“Recurrent” sexual sadism involving nonconsenting others (i.e., multiple victims, each\non a separate occasion) may, as general rule, be interpreted as three or more victims on\nseparate occasions. Fewer victims can be interpreted as satisfying this criterion, if there are\nmultiple instances of infliction of pain and suffering to the same victim, or if there is cor-\nroborating evidence of a strong or preferential interest in pain and suffering involving\nmultiple victims. Note that multiple victims, as suggested earlier, are a sufficient but not\na necessary condition for diagnosis, as the criteria may be met if the individual acknowl-\nedges intense sadistic sexual interest. \nThe Criterion A time frame, indicating that the signs or symptoms of sexual sadism\nmust have persisted for at least 6 months, should also be understood as a general guide-\nline, not a strict threshold, to ensure that the sexual interest in inflicting pain and suffering\non nonconsenting victims is not merely transient. However, the diagnosis may be met if\nthere is a clearly sustained but shorter period of sadistic behaviors. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nThe extensive use of pornography involving the infliction of pain and suffering is some-\ntimes an associated feature of sexual sadism disorder.\nPrevalence\nThe population prevalence of sexual sadism disorder is unknown and is largely based on\nindividuals in forensic settings. Depending on the criteria for sexual sadism, prevalence\nvaries widely, from 2% to 30%. Among civilly committed sexual offenders in the United\nStates, less than 10% have sexual sadism. Among individuals who have committed sexu-\nally motivated homicides, rates of sexual sadism disorder range from 37% to 75%. \nPedophilic Disorder\n697\nDevelopment and Course\nIndividuals with sexual sadism in forensic samples are almost exclusively male, but a rep-\nresentative sample of the population in Australia reported that 2.2% of men and 1.3% of\nwomen said they had been involved in bondage and discipline, “sadomasochism,” or dom-\ninance and submission in the previous year. Information on the development and course\nof sexual sadism disorder is extremely limited. One study reported that females became\naware of their sadomasochistic interest as young adults, and another reported that the\nmean age at onset of sadism in a group of males was 19.4 years. Whereas sexual sadism per\nse is probably a lifelong characteristic, sexual sadism disorder may fluctuate according to\nthe individual’s subjective distress or his or her propensity to harm nonconsenting others.\nAdvancing age is likely to have the same reducing effect on this disorder as it has on other\nparaphilic or normophilic sexual behavior.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nMany of the conditions that could be differential diagnoses for sexual sadism disorder\n(e.g., antisocial personality disorder, sexual masochism disorder, hypersexuality, sub-\nstance use disorders) sometimes occur also as comorbid diagnoses. Therefore, it is neces-\nsary to carefully evaluate the evidence for sexual sadism disorder, keeping the possibility\nof other paraphilias or mental disorders as part of the differential diagnosis. The majority\nof individuals who are active in community networks that practice sadistic and masoch-\nistic behaviors do not express any dissatisfaction with their sexual interests, and their be-\nhavior would not meet DSM-5 criteria for sexual sadism disorder. Sadistic interest, but not\nthe disorder, may be considered in the differential diagnosis.\nComorbidity\nKnown comorbidities with sexual sadism disorder are largely based on individuals (al-\nmost all males) convicted for criminal acts involving sadistic acts against nonconsenting\nvictims. Hence, these comorbidities might not apply to all individuals who never engaged\nin sadistic activity with a nonconsenting victim but who qualify for a diagnosis of sexual\nsadism disorder based on subjective distress over their sexual interest. Disorders that are\ncommonly comorbid with sexual sadism disorder include other paraphilic disorders."}

Examples of disclosing this paraphilia include candidly acknowledging an intense\nsexual interest in children and indicating that sexual interest in children is greater than or equal\nto sexual interest in physically mature individuals. If individuals also complain that their sex-\nual attractions or preferences for children are causing psychosocial difficulties, they may be di-\nagnosed with pedophilic disorder. However, if they report an absence of feelings of guilt,\nshame, or anxiety about these impulses and are not functionally limited by their paraphilic im-\npulses (according to self-report, objective assessment, or both), and their self-reported and le-\ngally recorded histories indicate that they have never acted on their impulses, then these\nindividuals have a pedophilic sexual interest but not pedophilic disorder.\nExamples of individuals who deny attraction to children include individuals who are\nknown to have sexually approached multiple children on separate occasions but who deny\nany urges or fantasies about sexual behavior involving children, and who may further claim\nthat the known episodes of physical contact were all unintentional and nonsexual. Other indi-\nviduals may acknowledge past episodes of sexual behavior involving children but deny any\nsignificant or sustained sexual interest in children. Since these individuals may deny experi-\nences impulses or fantasies involving children, they may also deny feeling subjectively dis-\ntressed. Such individuals may still be diagnosed with pedophilic disorder despite the absence\nof self-reported distress, provided that there is evidence of recurrent behaviors persisting for\n6 months (Criterion A) and evidence that the individual has acted on sexual urges or experi-\nenced interpersonal difficulties as a consequence of the disorder (Criterion B).\nPresence of multiple victims, as discussed above, is sufficient but not necessary for di-\nagnosis; that is, the individual can still meet Criterion A by merely acknowledging intense\nor preferential sexual interest in children. \nThe Criterion A clause, indicating that the signs or symptoms of pedophilia have per-\nsisted for 6 months or longer, is intended to ensure that the sexual attraction to children is\nnot merely transient. However, the diagnosis may be made if there is clinical evidence of\nsustained persistence of the sexual attraction to children even if the 6-month duration can-\nnot be precisely determined.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nThe extensive use of pornography depicting prepubescent children is a useful diagnostic\nindicator of pedophilic disorder. This is a specific instance of the general case that individ-\nuals are likely to choose the kind of pornography that corresponds to their sexual interests.\nPrevalence\nThe population prevalence of pedophilic disorder is unknown. The highest possible prev-\nalence for pedophilic disorder in the male population is approximately 3%–5%. The pop-\nulation prevalence of pedophilic disorder in females is even more uncertain, but it is likely\na small fraction of the prevalence in males.\nPedophilic Disorder\n699\nDevelopment and Course\nAdult males with pedophilic disorder may indicate that they become aware of strong or\npreferential sexual interest in children around the time of puberty—the same time frame\nin which males who later prefer physically mature partners became aware of their sexual\ninterest in women or men. Attempting to diagnose pedophilic disorder at the age at which\nit first manifests is problematic because of the difficulty during adolescent development in\ndifferentiating it from age-appropriate sexual interest in peers or from sexual curiosity.\nHence, Criterion C requires for diagnosis a minimum age of 16 years and at least 5 years\nolder than the child or children in Criterion A.\nPedophilia per se appears to be a lifelong condition. Pedophilic disorder, however,\nnecessarily includes other elements that may change over time with or without treatment:\nsubjective distress (e.g., guilt, shame, intense sexual frustration, or feelings of isolation) or\npsychosocial impairment, or the propensity to act out sexually with children, or both.\nTherefore, the course of pedophilic disorder may fluctuate, increase, or decrease with age.\nAdults with pedophilic disorder may report an awareness of sexual interest in children\nthat preceded engaging in sexual behavior involving children or self-identification as a pedo-\nphile. Advanced age is as likely to similarly diminish the frequency of sexual behavior involv-\ning children as it does other paraphilically motivated and normophilic sexual behavior.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nTemperamental.\nThere appears to be an interaction between pedophilia and antisocial-\nity, such that males with both traits are more likely to act out sexually with children. Thus,\nantisocial personality disorder may be considered a risk factor for pedophilic disorder in\nmales with pedophilia. \nEnvironmental.\nAdult males with pedophilia often report that they were sexually abused\nas children. It is unclear, however, whether this correlation reflects a causal influence of\nchildhood sexual abuse on adult pedophilia.\nGenetic and physiological.\nSince pedophilia is a necessary condition for pedophilic dis-\norder, any factor that increases the probability of pedophilia also increases the risk of pe-\ndophilic disorder. There is some evidence that neurodevelopmental perturbation in utero\nincreases the probability of development of a pedophilic interest.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nPsychophysiological laboratory measures of sexual interest, which are sometimes useful in di-\nagnosing pedophilic disorder in males, are not necessarily useful in diagnosing this disorder in\nfemales, even when an identical procedure (e.g., viewing time) or analogous procedures (e.g.,\npenile plethysmography and vaginal photoplethysmography) are available.\nDiagnostic Markers\nPsychophysiological measures of sexual interest may sometimes be useful when an indi-\nvidual’s history suggests the possible presence of pedophilic disorder but the individual\ndenies strong or preferential attraction to children. The most thoroughly researched and\nlongest used of such measures is penile plethysmography, although the sensitivity and spec-\nificity of diagnosis may vary from one site to another. Viewing time, using photographs of\nnude or minimally clothed persons as visual stimuli, is also used to diagnose pedophilic\ndisorder, especially in combination with self-report measures. Mental health professionals\nin the United States, however, should be aware that possession of such visual stimuli, even\nfor diagnostic purposes, may violate American law regarding possession of child pornog-\nraphy and leave the mental health professional susceptible to criminal prosecution.\n700\nParaphilic Disorders\nDifferential Diagnosis\nMany of the conditions that could be differential diagnoses for pedophilic disorder also\nsometimes occur as comorbid diagnoses. It is therefore generally necessary to evaluate the\nevidence for pedophilic disorder and other possible conditions as separate questions.\nAntisocial personality disorder.\nThis disorder increases the likelihood that a person who\nis primarily attracted to the mature physique will approach a child, on one or a few occa-\nsions, on the basis of relative availability. The individual often shows other signs of this\npersonality disorder, such as recurrent law-breaking.\nAlcohol and substance use disorders.\nThe disinhibiting effects of intoxication may also\nincrease the likelihood that a person who is primarily attracted to the mature physique will\nsexually approach a child.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nThere are occasional individuals who complain about\nego-dystonic thoughts and worries about possible attraction to children. Clinical inter-\nviewing usually reveals an absence of sexual thoughts about children during high states of\nsexual arousal (e.g., approaching orgasm during masturbation) and sometimes additional\nego-dystonic, intrusive sexual ideas (e.g., concerns about homosexuality).\nComorbidity\nPsychiatric comorbidity of pedophilic disorder includes substance use disorders; depres-\nsive, bipolar, and anxiety disorders; antisocial personality disorder; and other paraphilic\ndisorders. However, findings on comorbid disorders are largely among individuals con-\nvicted for sexual offenses involving children (almost all males) and may not be general-\nizable to other individuals with pedophilic disorder (e.g., individuals who have never\napproached a child sexually but who qualify for the diagnosis of pedophilic disorder on\nthe basis of subjective distress)."}

Thus, an individual may have fetishistic disorder\nassociated with an inanimate object (e.g., female undergarments) or an exclusive focus on\nan intensely eroticized body part (e.g., feet, hair), or their fetishistic interest may meet cri-\nteria for various combinations of these specifiers (e.g., socks, shoes and feet).\nDiagnostic Features\nThe paraphilic focus of fetishistic disorder involves the persistent and repetitive use of or de-\npendence on nonliving objects or a highly specific focus on a (typically nongenital) body part\nas primary elements associated with sexual arousal (Criterion A). A diagnosis of fetishistic dis-\norder must include clinically significant personal distress or psychosocial role impairment\n(Criterion B). Common fetish objects include female undergarments, male or female footwear,\nrubber articles, leather clothing, or other wearing apparel. Highly eroticized body parts asso-\nciated with fetishistic disorder include feet, toes, and hair. It is not uncommon for sexualized\nfetishes to include both inanimate objects and body parts (e.g., dirty socks and feet), and for\nthis reason the definition of fetishistic disorder now re-incorporates partialism (i.e., an exclusive\nfocus on a body part) into its boundaries. Partialism, previously considered a paraphilia not\notherwise specified disorder, had historically been subsumed in fetishism prior to DSM-III.\nMany individuals who self-identify as fetishist practitioners do not necessarily report\nclinical impairment in association with their fetish-associated behaviors. Such individuals\ncould be considered as having a fetish but not fetishistic disorder. A diagnosis of fetishistic\ndisorder requires concurrent fulfillment of both the behaviors in Criterion A and the clin-\nically significant distress or impairment in functioning noted in Criterion B.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nFetishistic disorder can be a multisensory experience, including holding, tasting, rubbing,\ninserting, or smelling the fetish object while masturbating, or preferring that a sexual part-\nner wear or utilize a fetish object during sexual encounters. Some individuals may acquire\nextensive collections of highly desired fetish objects.\nDevelopment and Course \nUsually paraphilias have an onset during puberty, but fetishes can develop prior to ado-\nlescence. Once established, fetishistic disorder tends to have a continuous course that fluc-\ntuates in intensity and frequency of urges or behavior. \nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nKnowledge of and appropriate consideration for normative aspects of sexual behavior are\nimportant factors to explore to establish a clinical diagnosis of fetishistic disorder and to\ndistinguish a clinical diagnosis from a socially acceptable sexual behavior.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nFetishistic disorder has not been systematically reported to occur in females. In clinical\nsamples, fetishistic disorder is nearly exclusively reported in males.\nFunctional Consequences of Fetishistic Disorder\nTypical impairments associated with fetishistic disorder include sexual dysfunction\nduring romantic reciprocal relationships when the preferred fetish object or body part is\n702\nParaphilic Disorders\nunavailable during foreplay or coitus. Some individuals with fetishistic disorder may pre-\nfer solitary sexual activity associated with their fetishistic preference(s) even while in-\nvolved in a meaningful reciprocal and affectionate relationship.\nAlthough fetishistic disorder is relatively uncommon among arrested sexual offenders\nwith paraphilias, males with fetishistic disorder may steal and collect their particular fe-\ntishistic objects of desire. Such individuals have been arrested and charged for nonsexual\nantisocial behaviors (e.g., breaking and entering, theft, burglary) that are primarily moti-\nvated by the fetishistic disorder.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nTransvestic disorder.\nThe nearest diagnostic neighbor of fetishistic disorder is transves-\ntic disorder. As noted in the diagnostic criteria, fetishistic disorder is not diagnosed when\nfetish objects are limited to articles of clothing exclusively worn during cross-dressing (as\nin transvestic disorder), or when the object is genitally stimulating because it has been de-\nsigned for that purpose (e.g., a vibrator). \nSexual masochism disorder or other paraphilic disorders.\nFetishes can co-occur with\nother paraphilic disorders, especially “sadomasochism” and transvestic disorder. When\nan individual fantasizes about or engages in “forced cross-dressing” and is primarily sex-\nually aroused by the domination or humiliation associated with such fantasy or repetitive\nactivity, the diagnosis of sexual masochism disorder should be made.\nFetishistic behavior without fetishistic disorder.\nUse of a fetish object for sexual arousal\nwithout any associated distress or psychosocial role impairment or other adverse conse-\nquence would not meet criteria for fetishistic disorder, as the threshold required by Crite-\nrion B would not be met. For example, an individual whose sexual partner either shares or\ncan successfully incorporate his interest in caressing, smelling, or licking feet or toes as an\nimportant element of foreplay would not be diagnosed with fetishistic disorder; nor\nwould an individual who prefers, and is not distressed or impaired by, solitary sexual be-\nhavior associated with wearing rubber garments or leather boots.\nComorbidity\nFetishistic disorder may co-occur with other paraphilic disorders as well as hypersexual-\nity. Rarely, fetishistic disorder may be associated with neurological conditions."}

The presence of autogynephilia increases the likelihood of gender dyspho-\nria in men with transvestic disorder. \nDiagnostic Features\nThe diagnosis of transvestic disorder does not apply to all individuals who dress as the op-\nposite sex, even those who do so habitually. It applies to individuals whose cross-dressing\nor thoughts of cross-dressing are always or often accompanied by sexual excitement (Cri-\nterion A) and who are emotionally distressed by this pattern or feel it impairs social or in-\nterpersonal functioning (Criterion B). The cross-dressing may involve only one or two\narticles of clothing (e.g., for men, it may pertain only to women’s undergarments), or it\nmay involve dressing completely in the inner and outer garments of the other sex and (in\nmen) may include the use of women’s wigs and make-up. Transvestic disorder is nearly\nexclusively reported in males. Sexual arousal, in its most obvious form of penile erection,\nmay co-occur with cross-dressing in various ways. In younger males, cross-dressing often\nleads to masturbation, following which any female clothing is removed. Older males often\nlearn to avoid masturbating or doing anything to stimulate the penis so that the avoidance\nof ejaculation allows them to prolong their cross-dressing session. Males with female part-\nners sometimes complete a cross-dressing session by having intercourse with their part-\nners, and some have difficulty maintaining a sufficient erection for intercourse without\ncross-dressing (or private fantasies of cross-dressing).\nClinical assessment of distress or impairment, like clinical assessment of transvestic\nsexual arousal, is usually dependent on the individual’s self-report. The pattern of behav-\nior “purging and acquisition” often signifies the presence of distress in individuals with\ntransvestic disorder. During this behavioral pattern, an individual (usually a man) who\nhas spent a great deal of money on women’s clothes and other apparel (e.g., shoes, wigs)\ndiscards the items (i.e., purges them) in an effort to overcome urges to cross-dress, and\nthen begins acquiring a woman’s wardrobe all over again.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nTransvestic disorder in men is often accompanied by autogynephilia (i.e., a male’s para-\nphilic tendency to be sexually aroused by the thought or image of himself as a woman).\nAutogynephilic fantasies and behaviors may focus on the idea of exhibiting female phys-\niological functions (e.g., lactation, menstruation), engaging in stereotypically feminine be-\nhavior (e.g., knitting), or possessing female anatomy (e.g., breasts).\nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of transvestic disorder is unknown. Transvestic disorder is rare in males\nand extremely rare in females. Fewer than 3% of males report having ever been sexually\naroused by dressing in women’s attire. The percentage of individuals who have cross-\ndressed with sexual arousal more than once or a few times in their lifetimes would be even\nlower. The majority of males with transvestic disorder identify as heterosexual, although\nsome individuals have occasional sexual interaction with other males, especially when\nthey are cross-dressed. \nDevelopment and Course\nIn males, the first signs of transvestic disorder may begin in childhood, in the form of\nstrong fascination with a particular item of women’s attire. Prior to puberty, cross-dress-\ning produces generalized feelings of pleasurable excitement. With the arrival of puberty,\ndressing in women’s clothes begins to elicit penile erection and, in some cases, leads di-\n704\nParaphilic Disorders\nrectly to first ejaculation. In many cases, cross-dressing elicits less and less sexual ex-\ncitement as the individual grows older; eventually it may produce no discernible penile\nresponse at all. The desire to cross-dress, at the same time, remains the same or grows even\nstronger. Individuals who report such a diminution of sexual response typically report\nthat the sexual excitement of cross-dressing has been replaced by feelings of comfort or\nwell-being.\nIn some cases, the course of transvestic disorder is continuous, and in others it is epi-\nsodic. It is not rare for men with transvestic disorder to lose interest in cross-dressing when\nthey first fall in love with a woman and begin a relationship, but such abatement usually\nproves temporary. When the desire to cross-dress returns, so does the associated distress.\nSome cases of transvestic disorder progress to gender dysphoria. The males in these\ncases, who may be indistinguishable from others with transvestic disorder in adolescence\nor early childhood, gradually develop desires to remain in the female role for longer pe-\nriods and to feminize their anatomy. The development of gender dysphoria is usually ac-\ncompanied by a (self-reported) reduction or elimination of sexual arousal in association\nwith cross-dressing.\nThe manifestation of transvestism in penile erection and stimulation, like the manifesta-\ntion of other paraphilic as well as normophilic sexual interests, is most intense in adolescence\nand early adulthood. The severity of transvestic disorder is highest in adulthood, when the\ntransvestic drives are most likely to conflict with performance in heterosexual intercourse\nand desires to marry and start a family. Middle-age and older men with a history of trans-\nvestism are less likely to present with transvestic disorder than with gender dysphoria.\nFunctional Consequences of Transvestic Disorder\nEngaging in transvestic behaviors can interfere with, or detract from, heterosexual rela-\ntionships. This can be a source of distress to men who wish to maintain conventional mar-\nriages or romantic partnerships with women.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nFetishistic disorder.\nThis disorder may resemble transvestic disorder, in particular, in\nmen with fetishism who put on women’s undergarments while masturbating with them.\nDistinguishing transvestic disorder depends on the individual’s specific thoughts during\nsuch activity (e.g., are there any ideas of being a woman, being like a woman, or being\ndressed as a woman?) and on the presence of other fetishes (e.g., soft, silky fabrics, whether\nthese are used for garments or for something else). \nGender dysphoria.\nIndividuals with transvestic disorder do not report an incongruence be-\ntween their experienced gender and assigned gender nor a desire to be of the other gender; and\nthey typically do not have a history of childhood cross-gender behaviors, which would be\npresent in individuals with gender dysphoria. Individuals with a presentation that meets full\ncriteria for transvestic disorder as well as gender dysphoria should be given both diagnoses.\nComorbidity\nTransvestism (and thus transvestic disorder) is often found in association with other para-\nphilias. The most frequently co-occurring paraphilias are fetishism and masochism. One\nparticularly dangerous form of masochism, autoerotic asphyxia, is associated with transves-\ntism in a substantial proportion of fatal cases. \nOther Specified Paraphilic Disorder\n705"}
