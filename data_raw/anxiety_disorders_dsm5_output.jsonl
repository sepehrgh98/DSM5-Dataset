Developmentally inappropriate and excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation from\nthose to whom the individual is attached, as evidenced by at least three of the following:\n1. Recurrent excessive distress when anticipating or experiencing separation from\nhome or from major attachment figures.\nSeparation Anxiety Disorder\n191\n2. Persistent and excessive worry about losing major attachment figures or about pos-\nsible harm to them, such as illness, injury, disasters, or death.\n3. Persistent and excessive worry about experiencing an untoward event (e.g., getting\nlost, being kidnapped, having an accident, becoming ill) that causes separation\nfrom a major attachment figure.\n4. Persistent reluctance or refusal to go out, away from home, to school, to work, or\nelsewhere because of fear of separation.\n5. Persistent and excessive fear of or reluctance about being alone or without major\nattachment figures at home or in other settings.\n6. Persistent reluctance or refusal to sleep away from home or to go to sleep without\nbeing near a major attachment figure.\n7. Repeated nightmares involving the theme of separation.\n8. Repeated complaints of physical symptoms (e.g., headaches, stomachaches, nau-\nsea, vomiting) when separation from major attachment figures occurs or is antici-\npated.\nB. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, lasting at least 4 weeks in children and\nadolescents and typically 6 months or more in adults.\nC. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, aca-\ndemic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\nD. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as refusing\nto leave home because of excessive resistance to change in autism spectrum disorder;\ndelusions or hallucinations concerning separation in psychotic disorders; refusal to go\noutside without a trusted companion in agoraphobia; worries about ill health or other\nharm befalling significant others in generalized anxiety disorder; or concerns about\nhaving an illness in illness anxiety disorder.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of separation anxiety disorder is excessive fear or anxiety concerning\nseparation from home or attachment figures. The anxiety exceeds what may be expected\ngiven the person’s developmental level (Criterion A). Individuals with separation anxiety\ndisorder have symptoms that meet at least three of the following criteria: They experience\nrecurrent excessive distress when separation from home or major attachment figures is an-\nticipated or occurs (Criterion A1). They worry about the well-being or death of attachment\nfigures, particularly when separated from them, and they need to know the whereabouts\nof their attachment figures and want to stay in touch with them (Criterion A2). They also\nworry about untoward events to themselves, such as getting lost, being kidnapped, or\nhaving an accident, that would keep them from ever being reunited with their major at-\ntachment figure (Criterion A3). Individuals with separation anxiety disorder are reluctant\nor refuse to go out by themselves because of separation fears (Criterion A4). They have\npersistent and excessive fear or reluctance about being alone or without major attachment\nfigures at home or in other settings. Children with separation anxiety disorder may be un-\nable to stay or go in a room by themselves and may display “clinging” behavior, staying\nclose to or “shadowing” the parent around the house, or requiring someone to be with\nthem when going to another room in the house (Criterion A5). They have persistent reluc-\ntance or refusal to go to sleep without being near a major attachment figure or to sleep\naway from home (Criterion A6). Children with this disorder often have difficulty at bed-\ntime and may insist that someone stay with them until they fall asleep. During the night,\nthey may make their way to their parents’ bed (or that of a significant other, such as a sib-\nling). Children may be reluctant or refuse to attend camp, to sleep at friends’ homes, or to\ngo on errands. Adults may be uncomfortable when traveling independently (e.g., sleeping\nin a hotel room). There may be repeated nightmares in which the content expresses the in-\n192\nAnxiety Disorders\ndividual’s separation anxiety (e.g., destruction of the family through fire, murder, or other\ncatastrophe) (Criterion A7). Physical symptoms (e.g., headaches, abdominal complaints,\nnausea, vomiting) are common in children when separation from major attachment fig-\nures occurs or is anticipated (Criterion A8). Cardiovascular symptoms such as palpitations,\ndizziness, and feeling faint are rare in younger children but may occur in adolescents and\nadults.\nThe disturbance must last for a period of at least 4 weeks in children and adolescents\nyounger than 18 years and is typically 6 months or longer in adults (Criterion B). However,\nthe duration criterion for adults should be used as a general guide, with allowance for\nsome degree of flexibility. The disturbance must cause clinically significant distress or im-\npairment in social, academic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Cri-\nterion C). \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nWhen separated from major attachment figures, children with separation anxiety disorder\nmay exhibit social withdrawal, apathy, sadness, or difficulty concentrating on work or\nplay. Depending on their age, individuals may have fears of animals, monsters, the dark,\nmuggers, burglars, kidnappers, car accidents, plane travel, and other situations that are\nperceived as presenting danger to the family or themselves. Some individuals become\nhomesick and uncomfortable to the point of misery when away from home. Separation\nanxiety disorder in children may lead to school refusal, which in turn may lead to academic\ndifficulties and social isolation. When extremely upset at the prospect of separation, chil-\ndren may show anger or occasionally aggression toward someone who is forcing separa-\ntion. When alone, especially in the evening or the dark, young children may report unusual\nperceptual experiences (e.g., seeing people peering into their room, frightening creatures\nreaching for them, feeling eyes staring at them). Children with this disorder may be de-\nscribed as demanding, intrusive, and in need of constant attention, and, as adults, may ap-\npear dependent and overprotective. The individual’s excessive demands often become a\nsource of frustration for family members, leading to resentment and conflict in the family.\nPrevalence\nThe 12-month prevalence of separation anxiety disorder among adults in the United States\nis 0.9%–1.9%. In children, 6- to 12-month prevalence is estimated to be approximately 4%.\nIn adolescents in the United States, the 12-month prevalence is 1.6%. Separation anxiety\ndisorder decreases in prevalence from childhood through adolescence and adulthood and\nis the most prevalent anxiety disorder in children younger than 12 years. In clinical sam-\nples of children, the disorder is equally common in males and females. In the community,\nthe disorder is more frequent in females.\nDevelopment and Course\nPeriods of heightened separation anxiety from attachment figures are part of normal early\ndevelopment and may indicate the development of secure attachment relationships (e.g.,\naround 1 year of age, when infants may suffer from stranger anxiety). Onset of separation\nanxiety disorder may be as early as preschool age and may occur at any time during child-\nhood and more rarely in adolescence. Typically there are periods of exacerbation and re-\nmission. In some cases, both the anxiety about possible separation and the avoidance of\nsituations involving separation from the home or nuclear family (e.g., going away to col-\nlege, moving away from attachment figures) may persist through adulthood. However,\nthe majority of children with separation anxiety disorder are free of impairing anxiety dis-\norders over their lifetimes. Many adults with separation anxiety disorder do not recall a\nchildhood onset of separation anxiety disorder, although they may recall symptoms.\nSeparation Anxiety Disorder\n193\nThe manifestations of separation anxiety disorder vary with age. Younger children are\nmore reluctant to go to school or may avoid school altogether. Younger children may not\nexpress worries or specific fears of definite threats to parents, home, or themselves, and the\nanxiety is manifested only when separation is experienced. As children age, worries\nemerge; these are often worries about specific dangers (e.g., accidents, kidnapping, mug-\nging, death) or vague concerns about not being reunited with attachment figures. In adults,\nseparation anxiety disorder may limit their ability to cope with changes in circumstances\n(e.g., moving, getting married). Adults with the disorder are typically overconcerned about\ntheir offspring and spouses and experience marked discomfort when separated from them.\nThey may also experience significant disruption in work or social experiences because of\nneeding to continuously check on the whereabouts of a significant other. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors  \nEnvironmental.\nSeparation anxiety disorder often develops after life stress, especially a\nloss (e.g., the death of a relative or pet; an illness of the individual or a relative; a change of\nschools; parental divorce; a move to a new neighborhood; immigration; a disaster that in-\nvolved periods of separation from attachment figures). In young adults, other examples of\nlife stress include leaving the parental home, entering into a romantic relationship, and be-\ncoming a parent. Parental overprotection and intrusiveness may be associated with sepa-\nration anxiety disorder.\nGenetic and physiological.\nSeparation anxiety disorder in children may be heritable.\nHeritability was estimated at 73% in a community sample of 6-year-old twins, with higher\nrates in girls. Children with separation anxiety disorder display particularly enhanced\nsensitivity to respiratory stimulation using CO2-enriched air.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nThere are cultural variations in the degree to which it is considered desirable to tolerate\nseparation, so that demands and opportunities for separation between parents and chil-\ndren are avoided in some cultures. For example, there is wide variation across countries\nand cultures with respect to the age at which it is expected that offspring should leave the\nparental home. It is important to differentiate separation anxiety disorder from the high\nvalue some cultures place on strong interdependence among family members.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nGirls manifest greater reluctance to attend or avoidance of school than boys. Indirect ex-\npression of fear of separation may be more common in males than in females, for example,\nby limited independent activity, reluctance to be away from home alone, or distress when\nspouse or offspring do things independently or when contact with spouse or offspring is\nnot possible.\nSuicide Risk\nSeparation anxiety disorder in children may be associated with an increased risk for sui-\ncide. In a community sample, the presence of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, or sub-\nstance use has been associated with suicidal ideation and attempts. However, this\nassociation is not specific to separation anxiety disorder and is found in several anxiety\ndisorders.\nFunctional Consequences of Separation Anxiety Disorder\nIndividuals with separation anxiety disorder often limit independent activities away from\nhome or attachment figures (e.g., in children, avoiding school, not going to camp, having\n194\nAnxiety Disorders\ndifficulty sleeping alone; in adolescents, not going away to college; in adults, not leaving the\nparental home, not traveling, not working outside the home). \nDifferential Diagnosis\nGeneralized anxiety disorder.\nSeparation anxiety disorder is distinguished from gener-\nalized anxiety disorder in that the anxiety predominantly concerns separation from attach-\nment figures, and if other worries occur, they do not predominate the clinical picture. \nPanic disorder.\nThreats of separation may lead to extreme anxiety and even a panic at-\ntack. In separation anxiety disorder, in contrast to panic disorder, the anxiety concerns the\npossibility of being away from attachment figures and worry about untoward events be-\nfalling them, rather than being incapacitated by an unexpected panic attack. \nAgoraphobia.\nUnlike individuals with agoraphobia, those with separation anxiety dis-\norder are not anxious about being trapped or incapacitated in situations from which es-\ncape is perceived as difficult in the event of panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating\nsymptoms.\nConduct disorder.\nSchool avoidance (truancy) is common in conduct disorder, but anx-\niety about separation is not responsible for school absences, and the child or adolescent\nusually stays away from, rather than returns to, the home. \nSocial anxiety disorder.\nSchool refusal may be due to social anxiety disorder (social pho-\nbia). In such instances, the school avoidance is due to fear of being judged negatively by oth-\ners rather than to worries about being separated from the attachment figures. \nPosttraumatic stress disorder.\nFear of separation from loved ones is common after trau-\nmatic events such as a disasters, particularly when periods of separation from loved ones\nwere experienced during the traumatic event. In posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the\ncentral symptoms concern intrusions about, and avoidance of, memories associated with\nthe traumatic event itself, whereas in separation anxiety disorder, the worries and avoid-\nance concern the well-being of attachment figures and separation from them.\nIllness anxiety disorder.\nIndividuals with illness anxiety disorder worry about specific\nillnesses they may have, but the main concern is about the medical diagnosis itself, not\nabout being separated from attachment figures.\nBereavement.\nIntense yearning or longing for the deceased, intense sorrow and emo-\ntional pain, and preoccupation with the deceased or the circumstances of the death are ex-\npected responses occurring in bereavement, whereas fear of separation from other\nattachment figures is central in separation anxiety disorder.\nDepressive and bipolar disorders.\nThese disorders may be associated with reluctance\nto leave home, but the main concern is not worry or fear of untoward events befalling at-\ntachment figures, but rather low motivation for engaging with the outside world. How-\never, individuals with separation anxiety disorder may become depressed while being\nseparated or in anticipation of separation.\nOppositional defiant disorder.\nChildren and adolescents with separation anxiety disor-\nder may be oppositional in the context of being forced to separate from attachment figures.\nOppositional defiant disorder should be considered only when there is persistent opposi-\ntional behavior unrelated to the anticipation or occurrence of separation from attachment\nfigures.\nPsychotic disorders.\nUnlike the hallucinations in psychotic disorders, the unusual per-\nceptual experiences that may occur in separation anxiety disorder are usually based on a\nmisperception of an actual stimulus, occur only in certain situations (e.g., nighttime), and\nare reversed by the presence of an attachment figure.\nSelective Mutism\n195\nPersonality disorders.\nDependent personality disorder is characterized by an indis-\ncriminate tendency to rely on others, whereas separation anxiety disorder involves con-\ncern about the proximity and safety of main attachment figures. Borderline personality\ndisorder is characterized by fear of abandonment by loved ones, but problems in identity,\nself-direction, interpersonal functioning, and impulsivity are additionally central to that\ndisorder, whereas they are not central to separation anxiety disorder. \nComorbidity\nIn children, separation anxiety disorder is highly comorbid with generalized anxiety dis-\norder and specific phobia. In adults, common comorbidities include specific phobia,\nPTSD, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia,\nobsessive-compulsive disorder, and personality disorders. Depressive and bipolar disor-\nders are also comorbid with separation anxiety disorder in adults."}

Consistent failure to speak in specific social situations in which there is an expectation\nfor speaking (e.g., at school) despite speaking in other situations.\nB. The disturbance interferes with educational or occupational achievement or with social\ncommunication.\nC. The duration of the disturbance is at least 1 month (not limited to the first month of\nschool).\nD. The failure to speak is not attributable to a lack of knowledge of, or comfort with, the\nspoken language required in the social situation.\nE. The disturbance is not better explained by a communication disorder (e.g., childhood-\nonset fluency disorder) and does not occur exclusively during the course of autism\nspectrum disorder, schizophrenia, or another psychotic disorder.\nDiagnostic Features\nWhen encountering other individuals in social interactions, children with selective mut-\nism do not initiate speech or reciprocally respond when spoken to by others. Lack of\nspeech occurs in social interactions with children or adults. Children with selective mut-\nism will speak in their home in the presence of immediate family members but often not\neven in front of close friends or second-degree relatives, such as grandparents or cousins.\nThe disturbance is often marked by high social anxiety. Children with selective mutism of-\nten refuse to speak at school, leading to academic or educational impairment, as teachers\noften find it difficult to assess skills such as reading. The lack of speech may interfere with\nsocial communication, although children with this disorder sometimes use nonspoken or\nnonverbal means (e.g., grunting, pointing, writing) to communicate and may be willing or\neager to perform or engage in social encounters when speech is not required (e.g., nonver-\nbal parts in school plays). \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nAssociated features of selective mutism may include excessive shyness, fear of social em-\nbarrassment, social isolation and withdrawal, clinging, compulsive traits, negativism,\ntemper tantrums, or mild oppositional behavior. Although children with this disorder\ngenerally have normal language skills, there may occasionally be an associated commu-\n196\nAnxiety Disorders\nnication disorder, although no particular association with a specific communication dis-\norder has been identified. Even when these disorders are present, anxiety is present as\nwell. In clinical settings, children with selective mutism are almost always given an addi-\ntional diagnosis of another anxiety disorder—most commonly, social anxiety disorder (so-\ncial phobia).\nPrevalence\nSelective mutism is a relatively rare disorder and has not been included as a diagnostic cat-\negory in epidemiological studies of prevalence of childhood disorders. Point prevalence\nusing various clinic or school samples ranges between 0.03% and 1% depending on the set-\nting (e.g., clinic vs. school vs. general population) and ages of the individuals in the sample.\nThe prevalence of the disorder does not seem to vary by sex or race\/ethnicity. The disor-\nder is more likely to manifest in young children than in adolescents and adults.\nDevelopment and Course\nThe onset of selective mutism is usually before age 5 years, but the disturbance may not\ncome to clinical attention until entry into school, where there is an increase in social inter-\naction and performance tasks, such as reading aloud. The persistence of the disorder is\nvariable. Although clinical reports suggest that many individuals “outgrow” selective\nmutism, the longitudinal course of the disorder is unknown. In some cases, particularly in\nindividuals with social anxiety disorder, selective mutism may disappear, but symptoms\nof social anxiety disorder remain. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nTemperamental.\nTemperamental risk factors for selective mutism are not well identi-\nfied. Negative affectivity (neuroticism) or behavioral inhibition may play a role, as may\nparental history of shyness, social isolation, and social anxiety. Children with selective\nmutism may have subtle receptive language difficulties compared with their peers, al-\nthough receptive language is still within the normal range. \nEnvironmental.\nSocial inhibition on the part of parents may serve as a model for social\nreticence and selective mutism in children. Furthermore, parents of children with selective\nmutism have been described as overprotective or more controlling than parents of chil-\ndren with other anxiety disorders or no disorder.\nGenetic and physiological factors.\nBecause of the significant overlap between selective\nmutism and social anxiety disorder, there may be shared genetic factors between these\nconditions.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nChildren in families who have immigrated to a country where a different language is spo-\nken may refuse to speak the new language because of lack of knowledge of the language.\nIf comprehension of the new language is adequate but refusal to speak persists, a diagno-\nsis of selective mutism may be warranted.\nFunctional Consequences of Selective Mutism \nSelective mutism may result in social impairment, as children may be too anxious to en-\ngage in reciprocal social interaction with other children. As children with selective mutism\nmature, they may face increasing social isolation. In school settings, these children may\nsuffer academic impairment, because often they do not communicate with teachers re-\ngarding their academic or personal needs (e.g., not understanding a class assignment, not\nSpecific Phobia\n197\nasking to use the restroom). Severe impairment in school and social functioning, including\nthat resulting from teasing by peers, is common. In certain instances, selective mutism\nmay serve as a compensatory strategy to decrease anxious arousal in social encounters.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nCommunication disorders.\nSelective mutism should be distinguished from speech dis-\nturbances that are better explained by a communication disorder, such as language\ndisorder, speech sound disorder (previously phonological disorder), childhood-onset\nfluency disorder (stuttering), or pragmatic (social) communication disorder. Unlike selec-\ntive mutism, the speech disturbance in these conditions is not restricted to a specific social\nsituation. \nNeurodevelopmental disorders and schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.\nIndividuals with an autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia or another psychotic disor-\nder, or severe intellectual disability may have problems in social communication and be\nunable to speak appropriately in social situations. In contrast, selective mutism should be\ndiagnosed only when a child has an established capacity to speak in some social situations\n(e.g., typically at home).\nSocial anxiety disorder (social phobia).\nThe social anxiety and social avoidance in so-\ncial anxiety disorder may be associated with selective mutism. In such cases, both diagno-\nses may be given.\nComorbidity\nThe most common comorbid conditions are other anxiety disorders, most commonly so-\ncial anxiety disorder, followed by separation anxiety disorder and specific phobia. Oppo-\nsitional behaviors have been noted to occur in children with selective mutism, although\noppositional behavior may be limited to situations requiring speech. Communication de-\nlays or disorders also may appear in some children with selective mutism."}

Marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation (e.g., flying, heights, animals,\nreceiving an injection, seeing blood). \nNote: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing,\nor clinging.\nB.

The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder,\nincluding fear, anxiety, and avoidance of situations associated with panic-like symptoms\nor other incapacitating symptoms (as in agoraphobia); objects or situations related to\nobsessions (as in obsessive-compulsive disorder); reminders of traumatic events (as in\nposttraumatic stress disorder); separation from home or attachment figures (as in sep-\naration anxiety disorder); or social situations (as in social anxiety disorder).\n198\nAnxiety Disorders\nSpecify if:\nCode based on the phobic stimulus:\n300.29 (F40.218) Animal (e.g., spiders, insects, dogs).\n300.29 (F40.228) Natural environment (e.g., heights, storms, water).\n300.29 (F40.23x) Blood-injection-injury (e.g., needles, invasive medical procedures).\nCoding note: Select specific ICD-10-CM code as follows: F40.230 fear of blood;\nF40.231 fear of injections and transfusions; F40.232 fear of other medical care; or\nF40.233 fear of injury.\n300.29 (F40.248) Situational (e.g., airplanes, elevators, enclosed places).\n300.29 (F40.298) Other (e.g., situations that may lead to choking or vomiting; in chil-\ndren, e.g., loud sounds or costumed characters).\nCoding note: When more than one phobic stimulus is present, code all ICD-10-CM codes\nthat apply (e.g., for fear of snakes and flying, F40.218 specific phobia, animal, and\nF40.248 specific phobia, situational).\nSpecifiers\nIt is common for individuals to have multiple specific phobias. The average individual with\nspecific phobia fears three objects or situations, and approximately 75% of individuals with\nspecific phobia fear more than one situation or object. In such cases, multiple specific phobia\ndiagnoses, each with its own diagnostic code reflecting the phobic stimulus, would need to be\ngiven. For example, if an individual fears thunderstorms and flying, then two diagnoses\nwould be given: specific phobia, natural environment, and specific phobia, situational.\nDiagnostic Features\nA key feature of this disorder is that the fear or anxiety is circumscribed to the presence of a\nparticular situation or object (Criterion A), which may be termed the phobic stimulus. The cat-\negories of feared situations or objects are provided as specifiers. Many individuals fear objects\nor situations from more than one category, or phobic stimulus. For the diagnosis of specific\nphobia, the response must differ from normal, transient fears that commonly occur in the pop-\nulation. To meet the criteria for a diagnosis, the fear or anxiety must be intense or severe (i.e.,\n“marked”) (Criterion A). The amount of fear experienced may vary with proximity to the\nfeared object or situation and may occur in anticipation of or in the actual presence of the object\nor situation. Also, the fear or anxiety may take the form of a full or limited symptom panic at-\ntack (i.e., expected panic attack). Another characteristic of specific phobias is that fear or anxi-\nety is evoked nearly every time the individual comes into contact with the phobic stimulus\n(Criterion B). Thus, an individual who becomes anxious only occasionally upon being con-\nfronted with the situation or object (e.g., becomes anxious when flying only on one out of every\nfive airplane flights) would not be diagnosed with specific phobia. However, the degree of fear\nor anxiety expressed may vary (from anticipatory anxiety to a full panic attack) across different\noccasions of encountering the phobic object or situation because of various contextual factors\nsuch as the presence of others, duration of exposure, and other threatening elements such as\nturbulence on a flight for individuals who fear flying. Fear and anxiety are often expressed dif-\nferently between children and adults. Also, the fear or anxiety occurs as soon as the phobic ob-\nject or situation is encountered (i.e., immediately rather than being delayed). \nThe individual actively avoids the situation, or if he or she either is unable or decides\nnot to avoid it, the situation or object evokes intense fear or anxiety (Criterion C). Active\navoidance means the individual intentionally behaves in ways that are designed to prevent\nor minimize contact with phobic objects or situations (e.g., takes tunnels instead of bridges\non daily commute to work for fear of heights; avoids entering a dark room for fear of spi-\nders; avoids accepting a job in a locale where a phobic stimulus is more common). Avoid-\nSpecific Phobia\n199\nance behaviors are often obvious (e.g., an individual who fears blood refusing to go to the\ndoctor) but are sometimes less obvious (e.g., an individual who fears snakes refusing to\nlook at pictures that resemble the form or shape of snakes). Many individuals with specific\nphobias have suffered over many years and have changed their living circumstances in\nways designed to avoid the phobic object or situation as much as possible (e.g., an indi-\nvidual diagnosed with specific phobia, animal, who moves to reside in an area devoid of\nthe particular feared animal). Therefore, they no longer experience fear or anxiety in their\ndaily life. In such instances, avoidance behaviors or ongoing refusal to engage in activities\nthat would involve exposure to the phobic object or situation (e.g., repeated refusal to ac-\ncept offers for work-related travel because of fear of flying) may be helpful in confirming\nthe diagnosis in the absence of overt anxiety or panic. \nThe fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger that the object or situation\nposes, or more intense than is deemed necessary (Criterion D). Although individuals with\nspecific phobia often recognize their reactions as disproportionate, they tend to overesti-\nmate the danger in their feared situations, and thus the judgment of being out of propor-\ntion is made by the clinician. The individual’s sociocultural context should also be taken\ninto account. For example, fears of the dark may be reasonable in a context of ongoing\nviolence, and fear of insects may be more disproportionate in settings where insects are\nconsumed in the diet. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for\n6 months or more (Criterion E), which helps distinguish the disorder from transient fears\nthat are common in the population, particularly among children. However, the duration\ncriterion should be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility.\nThe specific phobia must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-\ncupational, or other important areas of functioning in order for the disorder to be diag-\nnosed (Criterion F).\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with specific phobia typically experience an increase in physiological arousal\nin anticipation of or during exposure to a phobic object or situation. However, the physi-\nological response to the feared situation or object varies. Whereas individuals with situa-\ntional, natural environment, and animal specific phobias are likely to show sympathetic\nnervous system arousal, individuals with blood-injection-injury specific phobia often\ndemonstrate a vasovagal fainting or near-fainting response that is marked by initial brief\nacceleration of heart rate and elevation of blood pressure followed by a deceleration of\nheart rate and a drop in blood pressure. Current neural systems models for specific phobia\nemphasize the amygdala and related structures, much as in other anxiety disorders.\nPrevalence\nIn the United States, the 12-month community prevalence estimate for specific phobia is\napproximately 7%–9%. Prevalence rates in European countries are largely similar to those\nin the United States (e.g., about 6%), but rates are generally lower in Asian, African, and\nLatin American countries (2%–4%). Prevalence rates are approximately 5% in children and\nare approximately 16% in 13- to 17-year-olds. Prevalence rates are lower in older individ-\nuals (about 3%–5%), possibly reflecting diminishing severity to subclinical levels. Females\nare more frequently affected than males, at a rate of approximately 2:1, although rates vary\nacross different phobic stimuli. That is, animal, natural environment, and situational spe-\ncific phobias are predominantly experienced by females, whereas blood-injection-injury\nphobia is experienced nearly equally by both genders. \nDevelopment and Course\nSpecific phobia sometimes develops following a traumatic event (e.g., being attacked by\nan animal or stuck in an elevator), observation of others going through a traumatic event (e.g.,\n200\nAnxiety Disorders\nwatching someone drown), an unexpected panic attack in the to be feared situation (e.g.,\nan unexpected panic attack while on the subway), or informational transmission (e.g., ex-\ntensive media coverage of a plane crash). However, many individuals with specific phobia\nare unable to recall the specific reason for the onset of their phobias. Specific phobia usu-\nally develops in early childhood, with the majority of cases developing prior to age 10\nyears. The median age at onset is between 7 and 11 years, with the mean at about 10 years.\nSituational specific phobias tend to have a later age at onset than natural environment, an-\nimal, or blood-injection-injury specific phobias. Specific phobias that develop in child-\nhood and adolescence are likely to wax and wane during that period. However, phobias\nthat do persist into adulthood are unlikely to remit for the majority of individuals. \nWhen specific phobia is being diagnosed in children, two issues should be considered.\nFirst, young children may express their fear and anxiety by crying, tantrums, freezing,\nor clinging. Second, young children typically are not able to understand the concept of\navoidance. Therefore, the clinician should assemble additional information from parents,\nteachers, or others who know the child well. Excessive fears are quite common in young\nchildren but are usually transitory and only mildly impairing and thus considered devel-\nopmentally appropriate. In such cases a diagnosis of specific phobia would not be made.\nWhen the diagnosis of specific phobia is being considered in a child, it is important to\nassess the degree of impairment and the duration of the fear, anxiety, or avoidance, and\nwhether it is typical for the child’s particular developmental stage. \nAlthough the prevalence of specific phobia is lower in older populations, it remains\none of the more commonly experienced disorders in late life. Several issues should be con-\nsidered when diagnosing specific phobia in older populations. First, older individuals\nmay be more likely to endorse natural environment specific phobias, as well as phobias of\nfalling. Second, specific phobia (like all anxiety disorders) tends to co-occur with medical\nconcerns in older individuals, including coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease. Third, older individuals may be more likely to attribute the symptoms\nof anxiety to medical conditions. Fourth, older individuals may be more likely to manifest\nanxiety in an atypical manner (e.g., involving symptoms of both anxiety and depression)\nand thus be more likely to warrant a diagnosis of unspecified anxiety disorder. Addition-\nally, the presence of specific phobia in older adults is associated with decreased quality of\nlife and may serve as a risk factor for major neurocognitive disorder. \nAlthough most specific phobias develop in childhood and adolescence, it is possible for a\nspecific phobia to develop at any age, often as the result of experiences that are traumatic. For\nexample, phobias of choking almost always follow a near-choking event at any age. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nTemperamental.\nTemperamental risk factors for specific phobia, such as negative affec-\ntivity (neuroticism) or behavioral inhibition, are risk factors for other anxiety disorders as\nwell. \nEnvironmental.\nEnvironmental risk factors for specific phobias, such as parental over-\nprotectiveness, parental loss and separation, and physical and sexual abuse, tend to pre-\ndict other anxiety disorders as well. As noted earlier, negative or traumatic encounters\nwith the feared object or situation sometimes (but not always) precede the development of\nspecific phobia. \nGenetic and physiological.\nThere may be a genetic susceptibility to a certain category of\nspecific phobia (e.g., an individual with a first-degree relative with a specific phobia of an-\nimals is significantly more likely to have the same specific phobia than any other category\nof phobia). Individuals with blood-injection-injury phobia show a unique propensity to\nvasovagal syncope (fainting) in the presence of the phobic stimulus.\nSpecific Phobia\n201\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nIn the United States, Asians and Latinos report significantly lower rates of specific phobia\nthan non-Latino whites, African Americans, and Native Americans. In addition to having\nlower prevalence rates of specific phobia, some countries outside of the United States, par-\nticularly Asian and African countries, show differing phobia content, age at onset, and\ngender ratios. \nSuicide Risk \nIndividuals with specific phobia are up to 60% more likely to make a suicide attempt than\nare individuals without the diagnosis. However, it is likely that these elevated rates are\nprimarily due to comorbidity with personality disorders and other anxiety disorders. \nFunctional Consequences of Specific Phobia\nIndividuals with specific phobia show similar patterns of impairment in psychosocial\nfunctioning and decreased quality of life as individuals with other anxiety disorders and\nalcohol and substance use disorders, including impairments in occupational and inter-\npersonal functioning. In older adults, impairment may be seen in caregiving duties and\nvolunteer activities. Also, fear of falling in older adults can lead to reduced mobility and\nreduced physical and social functioning, and may lead to receiving formal or informal\nhome support. The distress and impairment caused by specific phobias tend to increase\nwith the number of feared objects and situations. Thus, an individual who fears four ob-\njects or situations is likely to have more impairment in his or her occupational and social\nroles and a lower quality of life than an individual who fears only one object or situation.\nIndividuals with blood-injection-injury specific phobia are often reluctant to obtain med-\nical care even when a medical concern is present. Additionally, fear of vomiting and chok-\ning may substantially reduce dietary intake. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nAgoraphobia.\nSituational specific phobia may resemble agoraphobia in its clinical pre-\nsentation, given the overlap in feared situations (e.g., flying, enclosed places, elevators). If\nan individual fears only one of the agoraphobia situations, then specific phobia, situa-\ntional, may be diagnosed. If two or more agoraphobic situations are feared, a diagnosis of\nagoraphobia is likely warranted. For example, an individual who fears airplanes and ele-\nvators (which overlap with the “public transportation” agoraphobic situation) but does\nnot fear other agoraphobic situations would be diagnosed with specific phobia, situa-\ntional, whereas an individual who fears airplanes, elevators, and crowds (which overlap\nwith two agoraphobic situations, “using public transportation” and “standing in line and\nor being in a crowd”) would be diagnosed with agoraphobia. Criterion B of agoraphobia\n(the situations are feared or avoided “because of thoughts that escape might be difficult or\nhelp might not be available in the event of developing panic-like symptoms or other inca-\npacitating or embarrassing symptoms”) can also be useful in differentiating agoraphobia\nfrom specific phobia. If the situations are feared for other reasons, such as fear of being\nharmed directly by the object or situations (e.g., fear of the plane crashing, fear of the an-\nimal biting), a specific phobia diagnosis may be more appropriate. \nSocial anxiety disorder.\nIf the situations are feared because of negative evaluation, so-\ncial anxiety disorder should be diagnosed instead of specific phobia.\nSeparation anxiety disorder.\nIf the situations are feared because of separation from a\nprimary caregiver or attachment figure, separation anxiety disorder should be diagnosed\ninstead of specific phobia.\n202\nAnxiety Disorders\nPanic disorder.\nIndividuals with specific phobia may experience panic attacks when con-\nfronted with their feared situation or object. A diagnosis of specific phobia would be given if\nthe panic attacks only occurred in response to the specific object or situation, whereas a di-\nagnosis of panic disorder would be given if the individual also experienced panic attacks\nthat were unexpected (i.e., not in response to the specific phobia object or situation).\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nIf an individual’s primary fear or anxiety is of an ob-\nject or situation as a result of obsessions (e.g., fear of blood due to obsessive thoughts about\ncontamination from blood-borne pathogens [i.e., HIV]; fear of driving due to obsessive im-\nages of harming others), and if other diagnostic criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder\nare met, then obsessive-compulsive disorder should be diagnosed. \nTrauma- and stressor-related disorders.\nIf the phobia develops following a traumatic\nevent, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) should be considered as a diagnosis. How-\never, traumatic events can precede the onset of PTSD and specific phobia. In this case, a di-\nagnosis of specific phobia would be assigned only if all of the criteria for PTSD are not met. \nEating disorders.\nA diagnosis of specific phobia is not given if the avoidance behavior is\nexclusively limited to avoidance of food and food-related cues, in which case a diagnosis\nof anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa should be considered.\nSchizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.\nWhen the fear and avoidance\nare due to delusional thinking (as in schizophrenia or other schizophrenia spectrum and\nother psychotic disorders), a diagnosis of specific phobia is not warranted. \nComorbidity\nSpecific phobia is rarely seen in medical-clinical settings in the absence of other psycho-\npathology and is more frequently seen in nonmedical mental health settings. Specific pho-\nbia is frequently associated with a range of other disorders, especially depression in older\nadults. Because of early onset, specific phobia is typically the temporally primary disorder.\nIndividuals with specific phobia are at increased risk for the development of other dis-\norders, including other anxiety disorders, depressive and bipolar disorders, substance-\nrelated disorders, somatic symptom and related disorders, and personality disorders (par-\nticularly dependent personality disorder)."}

The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation\nand to the sociocultural context.\nF. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more. \nG. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in\nsocial, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\nH. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a sub-\nstance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.\nI.\nThe fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another\nmental disorder, such as panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or autism spectrum\ndisorder.\nJ. If another medical condition (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, obesity, disfigurement from burns\nor injury) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is excessive. \nSpecify if: \nPerformance only: If the fear is restricted to speaking or performing in public.\nSpecifiers\nIndividuals with the performance only type of social anxiety disorder have performance\nfears that are typically most impairing in their professional lives (e.g., musicians, dancers,\nperformers, athletes) or in roles that require regular public speaking. Performance fears\nmay also manifest in work, school, or academic settings in which regular public presenta-\ntions are required. Individuals with performance only social anxiety disorder do not fear\nor avoid nonperformance social situations. \nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of social anxiety disorder is a marked, or intense, fear or anxiety of so-\ncial situations in which the individual may be scrutinized by others. In children the fear or\nanxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults (Criterion\nA). When exposed to such social situations, the individual fears that he or she will be neg-\natively evaluated. The individual is concerned that he or she will be judged as anxious,\nweak, crazy, stupid, boring, intimidating, dirty, or unlikable. The individual fears that\nhe or she will act or appear in a certain way or show anxiety symptoms, such as blushing,\ntrembling, sweating, stumbling over one’s words, or staring, that will be negatively eval-\nuated by others (Criterion B). Some individuals fear offending others or being rejected as\na result. Fear of offending others—for example, by a gaze or by showing anxiety symp-\ntoms—may be the predominant fear in individuals from cultures with strong collectivistic\norientations. An individual with fear of trembling of the hands may avoid drinking, eat-\ning, writing, or pointing in public; an individual with fear of sweating may avoid shaking\nhands or eating spicy foods; and an individual with fear of blushing may avoid public per-\nformance, bright lights, or discussion about intimate topics. Some individuals fear and\navoid urinating in public restrooms when other individuals are present (i.e., paruresis, or\n“shy bladder syndrome”). \nThe social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety (Criterion C). Thus, an in-\ndividual who becomes anxious only occasionally in the social situation(s) would not be di-\nagnosed with social anxiety disorder. However, the degree and type of fear and anxiety\nmay vary (e.g., anticipatory anxiety, a panic attack) across different occasions. The antici-\npatory anxiety may occur sometimes far in advance of upcoming situations (e.g., worrying\nevery day for weeks before attending a social event, repeating a speech for days in advance).\nIn children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, or\nshrinking in social situations. The individual will often avoid the feared social situations.\nAlternatively, the situations are endured with intense fear or anxiety (Criterion D). Avoid-\n204\nAnxiety Disorders\nance can be extensive (e.g., not going to parties, refusing school) or subtle (e.g., overpre-\nparing the text of a speech, diverting attention to others, limiting eye contact). \nThe fear or anxiety is judged to be out of proportion to the actual risk of being nega-\ntively evaluated or to the consequences of such negative evaluation (Criterion E). Some-\ntimes, the anxiety may not be judged to be excessive, because it is related to an actual\ndanger (e.g., being bullied or tormented by others). However, individuals with social anx-\niety disorder often overestimate the negative consequences of social situations, and thus\nthe judgment of being out of proportion is made by the clinician. The individual’s socio-\ncultural context needs to be taken into account when this judgment is being made. For ex-\nample, in certain cultures, behavior that might otherwise appear socially anxious may be\nconsidered appropriate in social situations (e.g., might be seen as a sign of respect).\nThe duration of the disturbance is typically at least 6 months (Criterion F). This dura-\ntion threshold helps distinguish the disorder from transient social fears that are com-\nmon, particularly among children and in the community. However, the duration criterion\nshould be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility. The fear,\nanxiety, and avoidance must interfere significantly with the individual’s normal routine,\noccupational or academic functioning, or social activities or relationships, or must cause\nclinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important ar-\neas of functioning (Criterion G). For example, an individual who is afraid to speak in pub-\nlic would not receive a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder if this activity is not routinely\nencountered on the job or in classroom work, and if the individual is not significantly dis-\ntressed about it. However, if the individual avoids, or is passed over for, the job or educa-\ntion he or she really wants because of social anxiety symptoms, Criterion G is met. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with social anxiety disorder may be inadequately assertive or excessively sub-\nmissive or, less commonly, highly controlling of the conversation. They may show overly\nrigid body posture or inadequate eye contact, or speak with an overly soft voice. These in-\ndividuals may be shy or withdrawn, and they may be less open in conversations and dis-\nclose little about themselves. They may seek employment in jobs that do not require social\ncontact, although this is not the case for individuals with social anxiety disorder, perfor-\nmance only. They may live at home longer. Men may be delayed in marrying and having\na family, whereas women who would want to work outside the home may live a life as\nhomemaker and mother. Self-medication with substances is common (e.g., drinking be-\nfore going to a party). Social anxiety among older adults may also include exacerbation of\nsymptoms of medical illnesses, such as increased tremor or tachycardia. Blushing is a hall-\nmark physical response of social anxiety disorder.\nPrevalence\nThe 12-month prevalence estimate of social anxiety disorder for the United States is ap-\nproximately 7%. Lower 12-month prevalence estimates are seen in much of the world us-\ning the same diagnostic instrument, clustering around 0.5%–2.0%; median prevalence in\nEurope is 2.3%. The 12-month prevalence rates in children and adolescents are comparable\nto those in adults. Prevalence rates decrease with age. The 12-month prevalence for older\nadults ranges from 2% to 5%. In general, higher rates of social anxiety disorder are found\nin females than in males in the general population (with odds ratios ranging from 1.5 to\n2.2), and the gender difference in prevalence is more pronounced in adolescents and\nyoung adults. Gender rates are equivalent or slightly higher for males in clinical samples,\nand it is assumed that gender roles and social expectations play a significant role in ex-\nplaining the heightened help-seeking behavior in male patients. Prevalence in the United\nStates is higher in American Indians and lower in persons of Asian, Latino, African Amer-\nican, and Afro-Caribbean descent compared with non-Hispanic whites.\nSocial Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)\n205\nDevelopment and Course\nMedian age at onset of social anxiety disorder in the United States is 13 years, and 75% of\nindividuals have an age at onset between 8 and 15 years. The disorder sometimes emerges\nout of a childhood history of social inhibition or shyness in U.S. and European studies. On-\nset can also occur in early childhood. Onset of social anxiety disorder may follow a stress-\nful or humiliating experience (e.g., being bullied, vomiting during a public speech), or it\nmay be insidious, developing slowly. First onset in adulthood is relatively rare and is more\nlikely to occur after a stressful or humiliating event or after life changes that require new\nsocial roles (e.g., marrying someone from a different social class, receiving a job promo-\ntion). Social anxiety disorder may diminish after an individual with fear of dating marries\nand may reemerge after divorce. Among individuals presenting to clinical care, the disor-\nder tends to be particularly persistent. \nAdolescents endorse a broader pattern of fear and avoidance, including of dating,\ncompared with younger children. Older adults express social anxiety at lower levels but\nacross a broader range of situations, whereas younger adults express higher levels of so-\ncial anxiety for specific situations. In older adults, social anxiety may concern disability\ndue to declining sensory functioning (hearing, vision) or embarrassment about one’s ap-\npearance (e.g., tremor as a symptom of Parkinson’s disease) or functioning due to medical\nconditions, incontinence, or cognitive impairment (e.g., forgetting people’s names). In the\ncommunity approximately 30% of individuals with social anxiety disorder experience re-\nmission of symptoms within 1 year, and about 50% experience remission within a few\nyears. For approximately 60% of individuals without a specific treatment for social anxiety\ndisorder, the course takes several years or longer.\nDetection of social anxiety disorder in older adults may be challenging because of sev-\neral factors, including a focus on somatic symptoms, comorbid medical illness, limited\ninsight, changes to social environment or roles that may obscure impairment in social\nfunctioning, or reticence about describing psychological distress.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nTemperamental.\nUnderlying traits that predispose individuals to social anxiety disor-\nder include behavioral inhibition and fear of negative evaluation.\nEnvironmental.\nThere is no causative role of increased rates of childhood maltreatment or\nother early-onset psychosocial adversity in the development of social anxiety disorder. How-\never, childhood maltreatment and adversity are risk factors for social anxiety disorder. \nGenetic and physiological.\nTraits predisposing individuals to social anxiety disorder,\nsuch as behavioral inhibition, are strongly genetically influenced. The genetic influence is\nsubject to gene-environment interaction; that is, children with high behavioral inhibition\nare more susceptible to environmental influences, such as socially anxious modeling by\nparents. Also, social anxiety disorder is heritable (but performance-only anxiety less so).\nFirst-degree relatives have a two to six times greater chance of having social anxiety dis-\norder, and liability to the disorder involves the interplay of disorder-specific (e.g., fear of\nnegative evaluation) and nonspecific (e.g., neuroticism) genetic factors.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nThe syndrome of taijin kyofusho (e.g., in Japan and Korea) is often characterized by social-\nevaluative concerns, fulfilling criteria for social anxiety disorder, that are associated with\nthe fear that the individual makes other people uncomfortable (e.g., “My gaze upsets peo-\nple so they look away and avoid me”), a fear that is at times experienced with delusional\nintensity. This symptom may also be found in non-Asian settings. Other presentations\nof taijin kyofusho may fulfill criteria for body dysmorphic disorder or delusional disorder.\n206\nAnxiety Disorders\nImmigrant status is associated with significantly lower rates of social anxiety disorder in\nboth Latino and non-Latino white groups. Prevalence rates of social anxiety disorder may\nnot be in line with self-reported social anxiety levels in the same culture—that is, societies\nwith strong collectivistic orientations may report high levels of social anxiety but low prev-\nalence of social anxiety disorder.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nFemales with social anxiety disorder report a greater number of social fears and comorbid\ndepressive, bipolar, and anxiety disorders, whereas males are more likely to fear dating,\nhave oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder, and use alcohol and illicit drugs to\nrelieve symptoms of the disorder. Paruresis is more common in males.\nFunctional Consequences of Social Anxiety Disorder\nSocial anxiety disorder is associated with elevated rates of school dropout and with de-\ncreased well-being, employment, workplace productivity, socioeconomic status, and quality\nof life. Social anxiety disorder is also associated with being single, unmarried, or divorced\nand with not having children, particularly among men. In older adults, there may be impair-\nment in caregiving duties and volunteer activities. Social anxiety disorder also impedes lei-\nsure activities. Despite the extent of distress and social impairment associated with social\nanxiety disorder, only about half of individuals with the disorder in Western societies ever\nseek treatment, and they tend to do so only after 15–20 years of experiencing symptoms. Not\nbeing employed is a strong predictor for the persistence of social anxiety disorder.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nNormative shyness.\nShyness (i.e., social reticence) is a common personality trait and is\nnot by itself pathological. In some societies, shyness is even evaluated positively. How-\never, when there is a significant adverse impact on social, occupational, and other impor-\ntant areas of functioning, a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder should be considered, and\nwhen full diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder are met, the disorder should be di-\nagnosed. Only a minority (12%) of self-identified shy individuals in the United States have\nsymptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder.\nAgoraphobia.\nIndividuals with agoraphobia may fear and avoid social situations (e.g., go-\ning to a movie) because escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of\nincapacitation or panic-like symptoms, whereas individuals with social anxiety disorder are\nmost fearful of scrutiny by others. Moreover, individuals with social anxiety disorder are likely\nto be calm when left entirely alone, which is often not the case in agoraphobia.\nPanic disorder.\nIndividuals with social anxiety disorder may have panic attacks, but the\nconcern is about fear of negative evaluation, whereas in panic disorder the concern is\nabout the panic attacks themselves. \nGeneralized anxiety disorder.\nSocial worries are common in generalized anxiety disorder,\nbut the focus is more on the nature of ongoing relationships rather than on fear of negative\nevaluation. Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder, particularly children, may have ex-\ncessive worries about the quality of their social performance, but these worries also pertain to\nnonsocial performance and when the individual is not being evaluated by others. In social anx-\niety disorder, the worries focus on social performance and others’ evaluation. \nSeparation anxiety disorder.\nIndividuals with separation anxiety disorder may avoid\nsocial settings (including school refusal) because of concerns about being separated from\nattachment figures or, in children, about requiring the presence of a parent when it is not\ndevelopmentally appropriate. Individuals with separation anxiety disorder are usually\ncomfortable in social settings when their attachment figure is present or when they are at\nSocial Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)\n207\nhome, whereas those with social anxiety disorder may be uncomfortable when social sit-\nuations occur at home or in the presence of attachment figures.\nSpecific phobias.\nIndividuals with specific phobias may fear embarrassment or humil-\niation (e.g., embarrassment about fainting when they have their blood drawn), but they do\nnot generally fear negative evaluation in other social situations.\nSelective mutism.\nIndividuals with selective mutism may fail to speak because of fear of\nnegative evaluation, but they do not fear negative evaluation in social situations where no\nspeaking is required (e.g., nonverbal play). \nMajor depressive disorder.\nIndividuals with major depressive disorder may be con-\ncerned about being negatively evaluated by others because they feel they are bad or not\nworthy of being liked. In contrast, individuals with social anxiety disorder are worried\nabout being negatively evaluated because of certain social behaviors or physical symptoms.\nBody dysmorphic disorder.\nIndividuals with body dysmorphic disorder are preoccu-\npied with one or more perceived defects or flaws in their physical appearance that are not\nobservable or appear slight to others; this preoccupation often causes social anxiety and\navoidance. If their social fears and avoidance are caused only by their beliefs about their\nappearance, a separate diagnosis of social anxiety disorder is not warranted.\nDelusional disorder.\nIndividuals with delusional disorder may have nonbizarre delu-\nsions and\/or hallucinations related to the delusional theme that focus on being rejected by\nor offending others. Although extent of insight into beliefs about social situations may\nvary, many individuals with social anxiety disorder have good insight that their beliefs are\nout of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation.\nAutism spectrum disorder.\nSocial anxiety and social communication deficits are hall-\nmarks of autism spectrum disorder. Individuals with social anxiety disorder typically\nhave adequate age-appropriate social relationships and social communication capacity,\nalthough they may appear to have impairment in these areas when first interacting with\nunfamiliar peers or adults.\nPersonality disorders.\nGiven its frequent onset in childhood and its persistence into and\nthrough adulthood, social anxiety disorder may resemble a personality disorder. The most\napparent overlap is with avoidant personality disorder. Individuals with avoidant person-\nality disorder have a broader avoidance pattern than those with social anxiety disorder.\nNonetheless, social anxiety disorder is typically more comorbid with avoidant personality\ndisorder than with other personality disorders, and avoidant personality disorder is more\ncomorbid with social anxiety disorder than with other anxiety disorders. \nOther mental disorders.\nSocial fears and discomfort can occur as part of schizophrenia,\nbut other evidence for psychotic symptoms is usually present. In individuals with an eat-\ning disorder, it is important to determine that fear of negative evaluation about eating\ndisorder symptoms or behaviors (e.g., purging and vomiting) is not the sole source of so-\ncial anxiety before applying a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder. Similarly, obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder may be associated with social anxiety, but the additional diagnosis of\nsocial anxiety disorder is used only when social fears and avoidance are independent of\nthe foci of the obsessions and compulsions. \nOther medical conditions.\nMedical conditions may produce symptoms that may be em-\nbarrassing (e.g. trembling in Parkinson’s disease). When the fear of negative evaluation\ndue to other medical conditions is excessive, a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder should\nbe considered.\nOppositional defiant disorder.\nRefusal to speak due to opposition to authority figures\nshould be differentiated from failure to speak due to fear of negative evaluation.\n208\nAnxiety Disorders\nComorbidity\nSocial anxiety disorder is often comorbid with other anxiety disorders, major depressive\ndisorder, and substance use disorders, and the onset of social anxiety disorder generally\nprecedes that of the other disorders, except for specific phobia and separation anxiety dis-\norder. Chronic social isolation in the course of a social anxiety disorder may result in major\ndepressive disorder. Comorbidity with depression is high also in older adults. Substances\nmay be used as self-medication for social fears, but the symptoms of substance intoxica-\ntion or withdrawal, such as trembling, may also be a source of (further) social fear. Social\nanxiety disorder is frequently comorbid with bipolar disorder or body dysmorphic disor-\nder; for example, an individual has body dysmorphic disorder concerning a preoccupa-\ntion with a slight irregularity of her nose, as well as social anxiety disorder because of a\nsevere fear of sounding unintelligent. The more generalized form of social anxiety disor-\nder, but not social anxiety disorder, performance only, is often comorbid with avoidant\npersonality disorder. In children, comorbidities with high-functioning autism and selec-\ntive mutism are common."}

A panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear\nor intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes, and during which time four\n(or more) of the following symptoms occur:\nNote: The abrupt surge can occur from a calm state or an anxious state.\n1. Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate.\n2. Sweating.\n3. Trembling or shaking.\n4. Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering.\n5. Feelings of choking.\n6. Chest pain or discomfort.\n7. Nausea or abdominal distress.\n8. Feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed, or faint.\n9. Chills or heat sensations.\n10.

Fear of dying.\nNote: Culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, uncontrol-\nlable screaming or crying) may be seen. Such symptoms should not count as one of\nthe four required symptoms.\nB. At least one of the attacks has been followed by 1 month (or more) of one or both of\nthe following: \n1. Persistent concern or worry about additional panic attacks or their consequences\n(e.g., losing control, having a heart attack, “going crazy”).\n2. A significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the attacks (e.g., behaviors\ndesigned to avoid having panic attacks, such as avoidance of exercise or unfamiliar\nsituations).\nPanic Disorder\n209\nC. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a\ndrug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism, car-\ndiopulmonary disorders).\nD. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., the panic at-\ntacks do not occur only in response to feared social situations, as in social anxiety dis-\norder; in response to circumscribed phobic objects or situations, as in specific phobia;\nin response to obsessions, as in obsessive-compulsive disorder; in response to re-\nminders of traumatic events, as in posttraumatic stress disorder; or in response to sep-\naration from attachment figures, as in separation anxiety disorder). \nDiagnostic Features\nPanic disorder refers to recurrent unexpected panic attacks (Criterion A). A panic attack is\nan abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes,\nand during which time four or more of a list of 13 physical and cognitive symptoms occur.\nThe term recurrent literally means more than one unexpected panic attack. The term unex-\npected refers to a panic attack for which there is no obvious cue or trigger at the time of oc-\ncurrence—that is, the attack appears to occur from out of the blue, such as when the\nindividual is relaxing or emerging from sleep (nocturnal panic attack). In contrast, expected\npanic attacks are attacks for which there is an obvious cue or trigger, such as a situation in\nwhich panic attacks typically occur. The determination of whether panic attacks are ex-\npected or unexpected is made by the clinician, who makes this judgment based on a com-\nbination of careful questioning as to the sequence of events preceding or leading up to the\nattack and the individual’s own judgment of whether or not the attack seemed to occur for\nno apparent reason. Cultural interpretations may influence the assignment of panic at-\ntacks as expected or unexpected (see section “Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues” for this\ndisorder). In the United States and Europe, approximately one-half of individuals with\npanic disorder have expected panic attacks as well as unexpected panic attacks. Thus, the\npresence of expected panic attacks does not rule out the diagnosis of panic disorder. For\nmore details regarding expected versus unexpected panic attacks, see the text accompa-\nnying panic attacks (pp. 214–217).\nThe frequency and severity of panic attacks vary widely. In terms of frequency, there\nmay be moderately frequent attacks (e.g., one per week) for months at a time, or short\nbursts of more frequent attacks (e.g., daily) separated by weeks or months without any at-\ntacks or with less frequent attacks (e.g., two per month) over many years. Persons who\nhave infrequent panic attacks resemble persons with more frequent panic attacks in terms\nof panic attack symptoms, demographic characteristics, comorbidity with other disorders,\nfamily history, and biological data. In terms of severity, individuals with panic disorder\nmay have both full-symptom (four or more symptoms) and limited-symptom (fewer than\nfour symptoms) attacks, and the number and type of panic attack symptoms frequently\ndiffer from one panic attack to the next. However, more than one unexpected full-symp-\ntom panic attack is required for the diagnosis of panic disorder. \nThe worries about panic attacks or their consequences usually pertain to physical con-\ncerns, such as worry that panic attacks reflect the presence of life-threatening illnesses\n(e.g., cardiac disease, seizure disorder); social concerns, such as embarrassment or fear of\nbeing judged negatively by others because of visible panic symptoms; and concerns about\nmental functioning, such as “going crazy” or losing control (Criterion B). The maladaptive\nchanges in behavior represent attempts to minimize or avoid panic attacks or their conse-\nquences. Examples include avoiding physical exertion, reorganizing daily life to ensure\nthat help is available in the event of a panic attack, restricting usual daily activities, and\navoiding agoraphobia-type situations, such as leaving home, using public transportation,\nor shopping. If agoraphobia is present, a separate diagnosis of agoraphobia is given.\n210\nAnxiety Disorders\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nOne type of unexpected panic attack is a nocturnal panic attack (i.e., waking from sleep in\na state of panic, which differs from panicking after fully waking from sleep). In the United\nStates, this type of panic attack has been estimated to occur at least one time in roughly\none-quarter to one-third of individuals with panic disorder, of whom the majority also\nhave daytime panic attacks. In addition to worry about panic attacks and their conse-\nquences, many individuals with panic disorder report constant or intermittent feelings of\nanxiety that are more broadly related to health and mental health concerns. For example,\nindividuals with panic disorder often anticipate a catastrophic outcome from a mild phys-\nical symptom or medication side effect (e.g., thinking that they may have heart disease or\nthat a headache means presence of a brain tumor). Such individuals often are relatively in-\ntolerant of medication side effects. In addition, there may be pervasive concerns about\nabilities to complete daily tasks or withstand daily stressors, excessive use of drugs (e.g.,\nalcohol, prescribed medications or illicit drugs) to control panic attacks, or extreme behav-\niors aimed at controlling panic attacks (e.g., severe restrictions on food intake or avoidance\nof specific foods or medications because of concerns about physical symptoms that pro-\nvoke panic attacks). \nPrevalence\nIn the general population, the 12-month prevalence estimate for panic disorder across the\nUnited States and several European countries is about 2%–3% in adults and adolescents. In\nthe United States, significantly lower rates of panic disorder are reported among Latinos,\nAfrican Americans, Caribbean blacks, and Asian Americans, compared with non-Latino\nwhites; American Indians, by contrast, have significantly higher rates. Lower estimates\nhave been reported for Asian, African, and Latin American countries, ranging from 0.1%\nto 0.8%. Females are more frequently affected than males, at a rate of approximately 2:1. The\ngender differentiation occurs in adolescence and is already observable before age 14 years.\nAlthough panic attacks occur in children, the overall prevalence of panic disorder is low\nbefore age 14 years (<0.4%). The rates of panic disorder show a gradual increase during ad-\nolescence, particularly in females, and possibly following the onset of puberty, and peak dur-\ning adulthood. The prevalence rates decline in older individuals (i.e., 0.7% in adults over\nthe age of 64), possibly reflecting diminishing severity to subclinical levels. \nDevelopment and Course\nThe median age at onset for panic disorder in the United States is 20–24 years. A small\nnumber of cases begin in childhood, and onset after age 45 years is unusual but can occur.\nThe usual course, if the disorder is untreated, is chronic but waxing and waning. Some in-\ndividuals may have episodic outbreaks with years of remission in between, and others\nmay have continuous severe symptomatology. Only a minority of individuals have full\nremission without subsequent relapse within a few years. The course of panic disorder\ntypically is complicated by a range of other disorders, in particular other anxiety disor-\nders, depressive disorders, and substance use disorders (see section “Comorbidity” for\nthis disorder). \nAlthough panic disorder is very rare in childhood, first occurrence of “fearful spells” is\noften dated retrospectively back to childhood. As in adults, panic disorder in adolescents\ntends to have a chronic course and is frequently comorbid with other anxiety, depressive,\nand bipolar disorders. To date, no differences in the clinical presentation between adoles-\ncents and adults have been found. However, adolescents may be less worried about addi-\ntional panic attacks than are young adults. Lower prevalence of panic disorder in older\nadults appears to be attributable to age-related “dampening” of the autonomic nervous\nsystem response. Many older individuals with “panicky feelings” are observed to have a\n“hybrid” of limited-symptom panic attacks and generalized anxiety. Also, older adults\nPanic Disorder\n211\ntend to attribute their panic attacks to certain stressful situations, such as a medical pro-\ncedure or social setting. Older individuals may retrospectively endorse explanations for\nthe panic attack (which would preclude the diagnosis of panic disorder), even if an attack\nmight actually have been unexpected in the moment (and thus qualify as the basis for a\npanic disorder diagnosis). This may result in under-endorsement of unexpected panic at-\ntacks in older individuals. Thus, careful questioning of older adults is required to assess\nwhether panic attacks were expected before entering the situation, so that unexpected\npanic attacks and the diagnosis of panic disorder are not overlooked.\nWhile the low rate of panic disorder in children could relate to difficulties in symptom\nreporting, this seems unlikely given that children are capable of reporting intense fear or\npanic in relation to separation and to phobic objects or phobic situations. Adolescents\nmight be less willing than adults to openly discuss panic attacks. Therefore, clinicians\nshould be aware that unexpected panic attacks do occur in adolescents, much as they do in\nadults, and be attuned to this possibility when encountering adolescents presenting with\nepisodes of intense fear or distress. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nTemperamental.\nNegative affectivity (neuroticism) (i.e., proneness to experiencing neg-\native emotions) and anxiety sensitivity (i.e., the disposition to believe that symptoms of\nanxiety are harmful) are risk factors for the onset of panic attacks and, separately, for\nworry about panic, although their risk status for the diagnosis of panic disorder is un-\nknown. History of “fearful spells” (i.e., limited-symptom attacks that do not meet full cri-\nteria for a panic attack) may be a risk factor for later panic attacks and panic disorder.\nAlthough separation anxiety in childhood, especially when severe, may precede the later\ndevelopment of panic disorder, it is not a consistent risk factor. \nEnvironmental.\nReports of childhood experiences of sexual and physical abuse are more\ncommon in panic disorder than in certain other anxiety disorders. Smoking is a risk factor\nfor panic attacks and panic disorder. Most individuals report identifiable stressors in the\nmonths before their first panic attack (e.g., interpersonal stressors and stressors related to\nphysical well-being, such as negative experiences with illicit or prescription drugs, dis-\nease, or death in the family). \nGenetic and physiological.\nIt is believed that multiple genes confer vulnerability to panic\ndisorder. However, the exact genes, gene products, or functions related to the genetic re-\ngions implicated remain unknown. Current neural systems models for panic disorder em-\nphasize the amygdala and related structures, much as in other anxiety disorders. There is\nan increased risk for panic disorder among offspring of parents with anxiety, depressive,\nand bipolar disorders. Respiratory disturbance, such as asthma, is associated with panic\ndisorder, in terms of past history, comorbidity, and family history. \nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues \nThe rate of fears about mental and somatic symptoms of anxiety appears to vary across\ncultures and may influence the rate of panic attacks and panic disorder. Also, cultural ex-\npectations may influence the classification of panic attacks as expected or unexpected. For\nexample, a Vietnamese individual who has a panic attack after walking out into a windy\nenvironment (trúng gió; “hit by the wind”) may attribute the panic attack to exposure to\nwind as a result of the cultural syndrome that links these two experiences, resulting in clas-\nsification of the panic attack as expected. Various other cultural syndromes are associated\nwith panic disorder, including ataque de nervios (“attack of nerves”) among Latin Ameri-\ncans and khyâl attacks and “soul loss” among Cambodians. Ataque de nervios may involve\ntrembling, uncontrollable screaming or crying, aggressive or suicidal behavior, and deper-\nsonalization or derealization, which may be experienced longer than the few minutes typical\n212\nAnxiety Disorders\nof panic attacks. Some clinical presentations of ataque de nervios fulfill criteria for condi-\ntions other than panic attack (e.g., other specified dissociative disorder). These syndromes\nimpact the symptoms and frequency of panic disorder, including the individual’s attribu-\ntion of unexpectedness, as cultural syndromes may create fear of certain situations, rang-\ning from interpersonal arguments (associated with ataque de nervios), to types of exertion\n(associated with khyâl attacks), to atmospheric wind (associated with trúng gió attacks).\nClarification of the details of cultural attributions may aid in distinguishing expected and\nunexpected panic attacks. For more information regarding cultural syndromes, refer to the\n“Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the Appendix.\nThe specific worries about panic attacks or their consequences are likely to vary from\none culture to another (and across different age groups and gender). For panic disorder,\nU.S. community samples of non-Latino whites have significantly less functional impair-\nment than African Americans. There are also higher rates of objectively defined severity in\nnon-Latino Caribbean blacks with panic disorder, and lower rates of panic disorder over-\nall in both African American and Afro-Caribbean groups, suggesting that among individ-\nuals of African descent, the criteria for panic disorder may be met only when there is\nsubstantial severity and impairment.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues \nThe clinical features of panic disorder do not appear to differ between males and females.\nThere is some evidence for sexual dimorphism, with an association between panic disor-\nder and the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene in females only.\nDiagnostic Markers\nAgents with disparate mechanisms of action, such as sodium lactate, caffeine, isoprotere-\nnol, yohimbine, carbon dioxide, and cholecystokinin, provoke panic attacks in individuals\nwith panic disorder to a much greater extent than in healthy control subjects (and in some\ncases, than in individuals with other anxiety, depressive, or bipolar disorders without\npanic attacks). Also, for a proportion of individuals with panic disorder, panic attacks are\nrelated to hypersensitive medullary carbon dioxide detectors, resulting in hypocapnia and\nother respiratory irregularities. However, none of these laboratory findings are consid-\nered diagnostic of panic disorder.\nSuicide Risk\nPanic attacks and a diagnosis of panic disorder in the past 12 months are related to a higher\nrate of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation in the past 12 months even when comorbid-\nity and a history of childhood abuse and other suicide risk factors are taken into account.\nFunctional Consequences of Panic Disorder\nPanic disorder is associated with high levels of social, occupational, and physical disabil-\nity; considerable economic costs; and the highest number of medical visits among the anx-\niety disorders, although the effects are strongest with the presence of agoraphobia.\nIndividuals with panic disorder may be frequently absent from work or school for doctor\nand emergency room visits, which can lead to unemployment or dropping out of school.\nIn older adults, impairment may be seen in caregiving duties or volunteer activities. Full-\nsymptom panic attacks typically are associated with greater morbidity (e.g., greater health\ncare utilization, more disability, poorer quality of life) than limited-symptom attacks. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther specified anxiety disorder or unspecified anxiety disorder.\nPanic disorder should\nnot be diagnosed if full-symptom (unexpected) panic attacks have never been experienced. In\nPanic Disorder\n213\nthe case of only limited-symptom unexpected panic attacks, an other specified anxiety dis-\norder or unspecified anxiety disorder diagnosis should be considered.\nAnxiety disorder due to another medical condition.\nPanic disorder is not diagnosed if\nthe panic attacks are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of another medical\ncondition. Examples of medical conditions that can cause panic attacks include hyperthy-\nroidism, hyperparathyroidism, pheochromocytoma, vestibular dysfunctions, seizure dis-\norders, and cardiopulmonary conditions (e.g., arrhythmias, supraventricular tachycardia,\nasthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]). Appropriate laboratory tests\n(e.g., serum calcium levels for hyperparathyroidism; Holter monitor for arrhythmias) or\nphysical examinations (e.g., for cardiac conditions) may be helpful in determining the eti-\nological role of another medical condition. \nSubstance\/medication-induced anxiety disorder.\nPanic disorder is not diagnosed if\nthe panic attacks are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a substance. In-\ntoxication with central nervous system stimulants (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines, caffeine)\nor cannabis and withdrawal from central nervous system depressants (e.g., alcohol, bar-\nbiturates) can precipitate a panic attack. However, if panic attacks continue to occur out-\nside of the context of substance use (e.g., long after the effects of intoxication or withdrawal\nhave ended), a diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered. In addition, because\npanic disorder may precede substance use in some individuals and may be associated\nwith increased substance use, especially for purposes of self-medication, a detailed history\nshould be taken to determine if the individual had panic attacks prior to excessive sub-\nstance use. If this is the case, a diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered in addition\nto a diagnosis of substance use disorder. Features such as onset after age 45 years or the\npresence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack (e.g., vertigo, loss of consciousness,\nloss of bladder or bowel control, slurred speech, amnesia) suggest the possibility that an-\nother medical condition or a substance may be causing the panic attack symptoms.\nOther mental disorders with panic attacks as an associated feature (e.g., other anxiety\ndisorders and psychotic disorders).\nPanic attacks that occur as a symptom of other anx-\niety disorders are expected (e.g., triggered by social situations in social anxiety disorder, by\nphobic objects or situations in specific phobia or agoraphobia, by worry in generalized anx-\niety disorder, by separation from home or attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder)\nand thus would not meet criteria for panic disorder. (Note: Sometimes an unexpected panic\nattack is associated with the onset of another anxiety disorder, but then the attacks become\nexpected, whereas panic disorder is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks.) If\nthe panic attacks occur only in response to specific triggers, then only the relevant anxiety\ndisorder is assigned. However, if the individual experiences unexpected panic attacks as\nwell and shows persistent concern and worry or behavioral change because of the attacks,\nthen an additional diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered.\nComorbidity\nPanic disorder infrequently occurs in clinical settings in the absence of other psychopa-\nthology. The prevalence of panic disorder is elevated in individuals with other disorders,\nparticularly other anxiety disorders (and especially agoraphobia), major depression, bipo-\nlar disorder, and possibly mild alcohol use disorder. While panic disorder often has an ear-\nlier age at onset than the comorbid disorder(s), onset sometimes occurs after the comorbid\ndisorder and may be seen as a severity marker of the comorbid illness. \nReported lifetime rates of comorbidity between major depressive disorder and panic\ndisorder vary widely, ranging from 10% to 65% in individuals with panic disorder. In ap-\nproximately one-third of individuals with both disorders, the depression precedes the on-\nset of panic disorder. In the remaining two-thirds, depression occurs coincident with or\nfollowing the onset of panic disorder. A subset of individuals with panic disorder develop\na substance-related disorder, which for some represents an attempt to treat their anxiety\n214\nAnxiety Disorders\nwith alcohol or medications. Comorbidity with other anxiety disorders and illness anxiety\ndisorder is also common. \nPanic disorder is significantly comorbid with numerous general medical symptoms\nand conditions, including, but not limited to, dizziness, cardiac arrhythmias, hyperthy-\nroidism, asthma, COPD, and irritable bowel syndrome. However, the nature of the asso-\nciation (e.g., cause and effect) between panic disorder and these conditions remains\nunclear. Although mitral valve prolapse and thyroid disease are more common among in-\ndividuals with panic disorder than in the general population, the differences in prevalence\nare not consistent."}
{"Subcategory":"Anxiety Disorders","Code":null,"Disorder":"Panic Attack Specifier","Content":"Panic Attack Specifier\n \nNote: Symptoms are presented for the purpose of identifying a panic attack; however,\npanic attack is not a mental disorder and cannot be coded. Panic attacks can occur in the\ncontext of any anxiety disorder as well as other mental disorders (e.g., depressive disor-\nders, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders) and some medical condi-\ntions (e.g., cardiac, respiratory, vestibular, gastrointestinal). When the presence of a panic\nattack is identified, it should be noted as a specifier (e.g., “posttraumatic stress disorder\nwith panic attacks”). For panic disorder, the presence of panic attack is contained within\nthe criteria for the disorder and panic attack is not used as a specifier.\nAn abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes,\nand during which time four (or more) of the following symptoms occur:\nNote: The abrupt surge can occur from a calm state or an anxious state.\n1. Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate.\n2. Sweating.\n3. Trembling or shaking.\n4. Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering.\n5. Feelings of choking.\n6. Chest pain or discomfort.\n7. Nausea or abdominal distress.\n8. Feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed, or faint.\n9. Chills or heat sensations.\n10. Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations).\n11. Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself).\n12. Fear of losing control or “going crazy.”\n13. Fear of dying.\nNote: Culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, uncontrollable\nscreaming or crying) may be seen. Such symptoms should not count as one of the four\nrequired symptoms.\nFeatures\nThe essential feature of a panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort\nthat reaches a peak within minutes and during which time four or more of 13 physical and cog-\nnitive symptoms occur. Eleven of these 13 symptoms are physical (e.g., palpitations, sweat-\ning), while two are cognitive (i.e., fear of losing control or going crazy, fear of dying). “Fear of\ngoing crazy” is a colloquialism often used by individuals with panic attacks and is not in-\ntended as a pejorative or diagnostic term. The term within minutes means that the time to peak\nPanic Attack Specifier\n215\nintensity is literally only a few minutes. A panic attack can arise from either a calm state or an\nanxious state, and time to peak intensity should be assessed independently of any preceding\nanxiety. That is, the start of the panic attack is the point at which there is an abrupt increase in\ndiscomfort rather than the point at which anxiety first developed. Likewise, a panic attack can\nreturn to either an anxious state or a calm state and possibly peak again. A panic attack is dis-\ntinguished from ongoing anxiety by its time to peak intensity, which occurs within minutes; its\ndiscrete nature; and its typically greater severity. Attacks that meet all other criteria but have\nfewer than four physical and\/or cognitive symptoms are referred to as limited-symptom attacks. \nThere are two characteristic types of panic attacks: expected and unexpected. Expected\npanic attacks are attacks for which there is an obvious cue or trigger, such as situations in\nwhich panic attacks have typically occurred. Unexpected panic attacks are those for which\nthere is no obvious cue or trigger at the time of occurrence (e.g., when relaxing or out of\nsleep [nocturnal panic attack]). The determination of whether panic attacks are expected\nor unexpected is made by the clinician, who makes this judgment based on a combination\nof careful questioning as to the sequence of events preceding or leading up to the attack\nand the individual’s own judgment of whether or not the attack seemed to occur for no ap-\nparent reason. Cultural interpretations may influence their determination as expected or\nunexpected. Culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, uncon-\ntrollable screaming or crying) may be seen; however, such symptoms should not count as\none of the four required symptoms. Panic attacks can occur in the context of any mental\ndisorder (e.g., anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, eating disorders,\nobsessive-compulsive and related disorders, personality disorders, psychotic disorders,\nsubstance use disorders) and some medical conditions (e.g., cardiac, respiratory, vestibu-\nlar, gastrointestinal), with the majority never meeting criteria for panic disorder. Recur-\nrent unexpected panic attacks are required for a diagnosis of panic disorder. \nAssociated Features \nOne type of unexpected panic attack is a nocturnal panic attack (i.e., waking from sleep in a\nstate of panic), which differs from panicking after fully waking from sleep. Panic attacks\nare related to a higher rate of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation even when comorbid-\nity and other suicide risk factors are taken into account.\nPrevalence\nIn the general population, 12-month prevalence estimates for panic attacks in the United\nStates is 11.2% in adults. Twelve-month prevalence estimates do not appear to differ sig-\nnificantly among African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos. Lower 12-month\nprevalence estimates for European countries appear to range from 2.7% to 3.3%. Females\nare more frequently affected than males, although this gender difference is more pro-\nnounced for panic disorder. Panic attacks can occur in children but are relatively rare until\nthe age of puberty, when the prevalence rates increase. The prevalence rates decline in\nolder individuals, possibly reflecting diminishing severity to subclinical levels.\nDevelopment and Course\nThe mean age at onset for panic attacks in the United States is approximately 22–23 years\namong adults. However, the course of panic attacks is likely influenced by the course of\nany co-occurring mental disorder(s) and stressful life events. Panic attacks are uncommon,\nand unexpected panic attacks are rare, in preadolescent children. Adolescents might be\nless willing than adults to openly discuss panic attacks, even though they present with ep-\nisodes of intense fear or discomfort. Lower prevalence of panic attacks in older individuals\nmay be related to a weaker autonomic response to emotional states relative to younger in-\ndividuals. Older individuals may be less inclined to use the word “fear” and more inclined\n216\nAnxiety Disorders\nto use the word “discomfort” to describe panic attacks. Older individuals with “panicky\nfeelings” may have a hybrid of limited-symptom attacks and generalized anxiety. In\naddition, older individuals tend to attribute panic attacks to certain situations that are\nstressful (e.g., medical procedures, social settings) and may retrospectively endorse expla-\nnations for the panic attack even if it was unexpected in the moment. This may result in un-\nder-endorsement of unexpected panic attacks in older individuals. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nTemperamental.\nNegative affectivity (neuroticism) (i.e., proneness to experiencing neg-\native emotions) and anxiety sensitivity (i.e., the disposition to believe that symptoms of\nanxiety are harmful) are risk factors for the onset of panic attacks. History of “fearful\nspells” (i.e., limited-symptom attacks that do not meet full criteria for a panic attack) may\nbe a risk factor for later panic attacks. \nEnvironmental.\nSmoking is a risk factor for panic attacks. Most individuals report iden-\ntifiable stressors in the months before their first panic attack (e.g., interpersonal stressors\nand stressors related to physical well-being, such as negative experiences with illicit or\nprescription drugs, disease, or death in the family). \nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nCultural interpretations may influence the determination of panic attacks as expected or\nunexpected. Culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, and un-\ncontrollable screaming or crying) may be seen; however, such symptoms should not count\nas one of the four required symptoms. Frequency of each of the 13 symptoms varies cross-\nculturally (e.g., higher rates of paresthesias in African Americans and of dizziness in sev-\neral Asian groups). Cultural syndromes also influence the cross-cultural presentation of\npanic attacks, resulting in different symptom profiles across different cultural groups. Ex-\namples include khyâl (wind) attacks, a Cambodian cultural syndrome involving dizziness,\ntinnitus, and neck soreness; and trúng gió (wind-related) attacks, a Vietnamese cultural\nsyndrome associated with headaches. Ataque de nervios (attack of nerves) is a cultural syn-\ndrome among Latin Americans that may involve trembling, uncontrollable screaming or\ncrying, aggressive or suicidal behavior, and depersonalization or derealization, and which\nmay be experienced for longer than only a few minutes. Some clinical presentations of\nataque de nervios fulfill criteria for conditions other than panic attack (e.g., other specified\ndissociative disorder). Also, cultural expectations may influence the classification of panic\nattacks as expected or unexpected, as cultural syndromes may create fear of certain situa-\ntions, ranging from interpersonal arguments (associated with ataque de nervios), to types of\nexertion (associated with khyâl attacks), to atmospheric wind (associated with trúng gió at-\ntacks). Clarification of the details of cultural attributions may aid in distinguishing ex-\npected and unexpected panic attacks. For more information about cultural syndromes, see\n“Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the Appendix to this manual.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nPanic attacks are more common in females than in males, but clinical features or symp-\ntoms of panic attacks do not differ between males and females.\nDiagnostic Markers\nPhysiological recordings of naturally occurring panic attacks in individuals with panic\ndisorder indicate abrupt surges of arousal, usually of heart rate, that reach a peak within\nminutes and subside within minutes, and for a proportion of these individuals the panic\nattack may be preceded by cardiorespiratory instabilities.\nAgoraphobia\n217\nFunctional Consequences of Panic Attacks\nIn the context of co-occurring mental disorders, including anxiety disorders, depressive\ndisorders, bipolar disorder, substance use disorders, psychotic disorders, and personality\ndisorders, panic attacks are associated with increased symptom severity, higher rates of\ncomorbidity and suicidality, and poorer treatment response. Also, full-symptom panic at-\ntacks typically are associated with greater morbidity (e.g., greater health care utilization,\nmore disability, poorer quality of life) than limited-symptom attacks. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther paroxysmal episodes (e.g., “anger attacks”).\nPanic attacks should not be diag-\nnosed if the episodes do not involve the essential feature of an abrupt surge of intense fear\nor intense discomfort, but rather other emotional states (e.g., anger, grief).\nAnxiety disorder due to another medical condition.\nMedical conditions that can cause\nor be misdiagnosed as panic attacks include hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, pheo-\nchromocytoma, vestibular dysfunctions, seizure disorders, and cardiopulmonary con-\nditions (e.g., arrhythmias, supraventricular tachycardia, asthma, chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease). Appropriate laboratory tests (e.g., serum calcium levels for hyperpara-\nthyroidism; Holter monitor for arrhythmias) or physical examinations (e.g., for cardiac con-\nditions) may be helpful in determining the etiological role of another medical condition. \nSubstance\/medication-induced anxiety disorder.\nIntoxication with central nervous\nsystem stimulants (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines, caffeine) or cannabis and withdrawal\nfrom central nervous system depressants (e.g., alcohol, barbiturates) can precipitate a\npanic attack.

Features such as onset after age 45 years or the\npresence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack (e.g., vertigo, loss of consciousness,\nloss of bladder or bowel control, slurred speech, or amnesia) suggest the possibility that a\nmedical condition or a substance may be causing the panic attack symptoms.\nPanic disorder.\nRepeated unexpected panic attacks are required but are not sufficient for\nthe diagnosis of panic disorder (i.e., full diagnostic criteria for panic disorder must be met). \nComorbidity\nPanic attacks are associated with increased likelihood of various comorbid mental dis-\norders, including anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, impulse-\ncontrol disorders, and substance use disorders. Panic attacks are associated with increased\nlikelihood of later developing anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, bipolar disorders,\nand possibly other disorders."}

The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more. \nG.

If another medical condition (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson’s disease)\nis present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly excessive. \nI.\nThe fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another men-\ntal disorder—for example, the symptoms are not confined to specific phobia, situational\ntype; do not involve only social situations (as in social anxiety disorder); and are not re-\nlated exclusively to obsessions (as in obsessive-compulsive disorder), perceived defects\nor flaws in physical appearance (as in body dysmorphic disorder), reminders of traumatic\nevents (as in posttraumatic stress disorder), or fear of separation (as in separation anx-\niety disorder).\nNote: Agoraphobia is diagnosed irrespective of the presence of panic disorder. If an indi-\nvidual’s presentation meets criteria for panic disorder and agoraphobia, both diagnoses\nshould be assigned.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of agoraphobia is marked, or intense, fear or anxiety triggered by the\nreal or anticipated exposure to a wide range of situations (Criterion A). The diagnosis re-\nquires endorsement of symptoms occurring in at least two of the following five situations:\n1) using public transporation, such as automobiles, buses, trains, ships, or planes; 2) being\nin open spaces, such as parking lots, marketplaces, or bridges; 3) being in enclosed spaces,\nsuch as shops, theaters, or cinemas; 4) standing in line or being in a crowd; or 5) being out-\nside of the home alone. The examples for each situation are not exhaustive; other situations\nmay be feared. When experiencing fear and anxiety cued by such situations, individuals\ntypically experience thoughts that something terrible might happen (Criterion B). Individ-\nuals frequently believe that escape from such situations might be difficult (e.g., “can’t get\nout of here”) or that help might be unavailable (e.g., “there is nobody to help me”) when\npanic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms occur. “Panic-like\nsymptoms” refer to any of the 13 symptoms included in the criteria for panic attack, such as\ndizziness, faintness, and fear of dying. “Other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms”\ninclude symptoms such as vomiting and inflammatory bowel symptoms, as well as, in\nolder adults, a fear of falling or, in children, a sense of disorientation and getting lost. \nThe amount of fear experienced may vary with proximity to the feared situation and\nmay occur in anticipation of or in the actual presence of the agoraphobic situation. Also,\nthe fear or anxiety may take the form of a full- or limited-symptom panic attack (i.e., an ex-\npected panic attack). Fear or anxiety is evoked nearly every time the individual comes into\ncontact with the feared situation (Criterion C). Thus, an individual who becomes anxious\nonly occasionally in an agoraphobic situation (e.g., becomes anxious when standing in line\non only one out of every five occasions) would not be diagnosed with agoraphobia. The in-\ndividual actively avoids the situation or, if he or she either is unable or decides not to avoid\nit, the situation evokes intense fear or anxiety (Criterion D). Active avoidance means the in-\ndividual is currently behaving in ways that are intentionally designed to prevent or min-\nimize contact with agoraphobic situations. Avoidance can be behavioral (e.g., changing\nAgoraphobia\n219\ndaily routines, choosing a job nearby to avoid using public transportation, arranging for\nfood delivery to avoid entering shops and supermarkets) as well as cognitive (e.g., using\ndistraction to get through agoraphobic situations) in nature. The avoidance can become so\nsevere that the person is completely homebound. Often, an individual is better able to con-\nfront a feared situation when accompanied by a companion, such as a partner, friend, or\nhealth professional.\nThe fear, anxiety, or avoidance must be out of proportion to the actual danger posed by\nthe agoraphobic situations and to the sociocultural context (Criterion E). Differentiating\nclinically significant agoraphobic fears from reasonable fears (e.g., leaving the house dur-\ning a bad storm) or from situations that are deemed dangerous (e.g., walking in a parking\nlot or using public transportation in a high-crime area) is important for a number of reasons.\nFirst, what constitutes avoidance may be difficult to judge across cultures and sociocultural\ncontexts (e.g., it is socioculturally appropriate for orthodox Muslim women in certain parts\nof the world to avoid leaving the house alone, and thus such avoidance would not be con-\nsidered indicative of agoraphobia). Second, older adults are likely to overattribute their\nfears to age-related constraints and are less likely to judge their fears as being out of pro-\nportion to the actual risk. Third, individuals with agoraphobia are likely to overestimate\ndanger in relation to panic-like or other bodily symptoms. Agoraphobia should be diag-\nnosed only if the fear, anxiety, or avoidance persists (Criterion F) and if it causes clinically\nsignificant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of func-\ntioning (Criterion G). The duration of “typically lasting for 6 months or more” is meant to\nexclude individuals with short-lived, transient problems. However, the duration criterion\nshould be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIn its most severe forms, agoraphobia can cause individuals to become completely home-\nbound, unable to leave their home and dependent on others for services or assistance to pro-\nvide even for basic needs. Demoralization and depressive symptoms, as well as abuse of\nalcohol and sedative medication as inappropriate self-medication strategies, are common. \nPrevalence\nEvery year approximately 1.7% of adolescents and adults have a diagnosis of agoraphobia.\nFemales are twice as likely as males to experience agoraphobia. Agoraphobia may occur in\nchildhood, but incidence peaks in late adolescence and early adulthood. Twelve-month\nprevalence in individuals older than 65 years is 0.4%. Prevalence rates do not appear to\nvary systematically across cultural\/racial groups.\nDevelopment and Course\nThe percentage of individuals with agoraphobia reporting panic attacks or panic disorder\npreceding the onset of agoraphobia ranges from 30% in community samples to more than\n50% in clinic samples. The majority of individuals with panic disorder show signs of anx-\niety and agoraphobia before the onset of panic disorder.\nIn two-thirds of all cases of agoraphobia, initial onset is before age 35 years. There is a\nsubstantial incidence risk in late adolescence and early adulthood, with indications for\na second high incidence risk phase after age 40 years. First onset in childhood is rare. The\noverall mean age at onset for agoraphobia is 17 years, although the age at onset without\npreceding panic attacks or panic disorder is 25–29 years. \nThe course of agoraphobia is typically persistent and chronic. Complete remission is\nrare (10%), unless the agoraphobia is treated. With more severe agoraphobia, rates of full\nremission decrease, whereas rates of relapse and chronicity increase. A range of other dis-\norders, in particular other anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, substance use disor-\nders, and personality disorders, may complicate the course of agoraphobia. The long-term\n220\nAnxiety Disorders\ncourse and outcome of agoraphobia are associated with substantially elevated risk of sec-\nondary major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), and sub-\nstance use disorders.\nThe clinical features of agoraphobia are relatively consistent across the lifespan, although\nthe type of agoraphobic situations triggering fear, anxiety, or avoidance, as well as the type of\ncognitions, may vary. For example, in children, being outside of the home alone is the most fre-\nquent situation feared, whereas in older adults, being in shops, standing in line, and being in\nopen spaces are most often feared. Also, cognitions often pertain to becoming lost (in children),\nto experiencing panic-like symptoms (in adults), to falling (in older adults).\nThe low prevalence of agoraphobia in children could reflect difficulties in symptom re-\nporting, and thus assessments in young children may require solicitation of information\nfrom multiple sources, including parents or teachers. Adolescents, particularly males,\nmay be less willing than adults to openly discuss agoraphobic fears and avoidance; how-\never, agoraphobia can occur prior to adulthood and should be assessed in children and\nadolescents. In older adults, comorbid somatic symptom disorders, as well as motor dis-\nturbances (e.g., sense of falling or having medical complications), are frequently men-\ntioned by individuals as the reason for their fear and avoidance. In these instances, care is\nto be taken in evaluating whether the fear and avoidance are out of proportion to the real\ndanger involved. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nTemperamental.\nBehavioral inhibition and neurotic disposition (i.e., negative affectivity\n[neuroticism] and anxiety sensitivity) are closely associated with agoraphobia but are rel-\nevant to most anxiety disorders (phobic disorders, panic disorder, generalized anxiety dis-\norder). Anxiety sensitivity (the disposition to believe that symptoms of anxiety are\nharmful) is also characteristic of individuals with agoraphobia.\nEnvironmental.\nNegative events in childhood (e.g., separation, death of parent) and other\nstressful events, such as being attacked or mugged, are associated with the onset of agorapho-\nbia. Furthermore, individuals with agoraphobia describe the family climate and child-rearing\nbehavior as being characterized by reduced warmth and increased overprotection.\nGenetic and physiological.\nHeritability for agoraphobia is 61%. Of the various phobias,\nagoraphobia has the strongest and most specific association with the genetic factor that\nrepresents proneness to phobias. \nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nFemales have different patterns of comorbid disorders than males. Consistent with gender\ndifferences in the prevalence of mental disorders, males have higher rates of comorbid\nsubstance use disorders. \nFunctional Consequences of Agoraphobia\nAgoraphobia is associated with considerable impairment and disability in terms of role\nfunctioning, work productivity, and disability days. Agoraphobia severity is a strong de-\nterminant of the degree of disability, irrespective of the presence of comorbid panic disor-\nder, panic attacks, and other comorbid conditions. More than one-third of individuals\nwith agoraphobia are completely homebound and unable to work. \nDifferential Diagnosis \nWhen diagnostic criteria for agoraphobia and another disorder are fully met, both diagnoses\nshould be assigned, unless the fear, anxiety, or avoidance of agoraphobia is attributable to the\nother disorder. Weighting of criteria and clinical judgment may be helpful in some cases. \nAgoraphobia\n221\nSpecific phobia, situational type.\nDifferentiating agoraphobia from situational specific\nphobia can be challenging in some cases, because these conditions share several symptom\ncharacteristics and criteria. Specific phobia, situational type, should be diagnosed versus ago-\nraphobia if the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is limited to one of the agoraphobic situations.\nRequiring fears from two or more of the agoraphobic situations is a robust means for differen-\ntiating agoraphobia from specific phobias, particularly the situational subtype. Additional dif-\nferentiating features include the cognitive ideation. Thus, if the situation is feared for reasons\nother than panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms (e.g., fears\nof being directly harmed by the situation itself, such as fear of the plane crashing for individ-\nuals who fear flying), then a diagnosis of specific phobia may be more appropriate. \nSeparation anxiety disorder.\nSeparation anxiety disorder can be best differentiated\nfrom agoraphobia by examining cognitive ideation. In separation anxiety disorder, the\nthoughts are about detachment from significant others and the home environment (i.e.,\nparents or other attachment figures), whereas in agoraphobia the focus is on panic-like\nsymptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms in the feared situations.\nSocial anxiety disorder (social phobia).\nAgoraphobia should be differentiated from so-\ncial anxiety disorder based primarily on the situational clusters that trigger fear, anxiety,\nor avoidance and the cognitive ideation. In social anxiety disorder, the focus is on fear of\nbeing negatively evaluated. \nPanic disorder.\nWhen criteria for panic disorder are met, agoraphobia should not be di-\nagnosed if the avoidance behaviors associated with the panic attacks do not extend to avoid-\nance of two or more agoraphobic situations.\nAcute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder.\nAcute stress disorder and\nposttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be differentiated from agoraphobia by examin-\ning whether the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is related only to situations that remind the\nindividual of a traumatic event. If the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is restricted to trauma re-\nminders, and if the avoidance behavior does not extend to two or more agoraphobic situ-\nations, then a diagnosis of agoraphobia is not warranted. \nMajor depressive disorder.\nIn major depressive disorder, the individual may avoid leav-\ning home because of apathy, loss of energy, low self-esteem, and anhedonia. If the avoid-\nance is unrelated to fears of panic-like or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms,\nthen agoraphobia should not be diagnosed.\nOther medical conditions.\nAgoraphobia is not diagnosed if the avoidance of situations\nis judged to be a physiological consequence of a medical condition. This determination is\nbased on history, laboratory findings, and a physical examination. Other relevant medical\nconditions may include neurodegenerative disorders with associated motor disturbances\n(e.g., Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis), as well as cardiovascular disorders. Individ-\nuals with certain medical conditions may avoid situations because of realistic concerns\nabout being incapacitated (e.g., fainting in an individual with transient ischemic attacks)\nor being embarrassed (e.g., diarrhea in an individual with Crohn’s disease). The diagnosis\nof agoraphobia should be given only when the fear or avoidance is clearly in excess of that\nusually associated with these medical conditions. \nComorbidity\nThe majority of individuals with agoraphobia also have other mental disorders. The most\nfrequent additional diagnoses are other anxiety disorders (e.g., specific phobias, panic dis-\norder, social anxiety disorder), depressive disorders (major depressive disorder), PTSD,\nand alcohol use disorder. Whereas other anxiety disorders (e.g., separation anxiety disor-\nder, specific phobias, panic disorder) frequently precede onset of agoraphobia, depressive\ndisorders and substance use disorders typically occur secondary to agoraphobia.\n222\nAnxiety Disorders"}

Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than\nnot for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school\nperformance). \nB. The individual finds it difficult to control the worry. \nC. The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symp-\ntoms (with at least some symptoms having been present for more days than not for the\npast 6 months):\nNote: Only one item is required in children.\n1. Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge.\n2. Being easily fatigued.\n3. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank.\n4. Irritability.\n5. Muscle tension.\n6. Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying\nsleep).\nD. The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impair-\nment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\nE. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a\ndrug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).\nF. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., anxiety or\nworry about having panic attacks in panic disorder, negative evaluation in social anxi-\nety disorder [social phobia], contamination or other obsessions in obsessive-compul-\nsive disorder, separation from attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder,\nreminders of traumatic events in posttraumatic stress disorder, gaining weight in an-\norexia nervosa, physical complaints in somatic symptom disorder, perceived appear-\nance flaws in body dysmorphic disorder, having a serious illness in illness anxiety\ndisorder, or the content of delusional beliefs in schizophrenia or delusional disorder).\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of generalized anxiety disorder is excessive anxiety and worry (ap-\nprehensive expectation) about a number of events or activities. The intensity, duration, or\nfrequency of the anxiety and worry is out of proportion to the actual likelihood or impact\nof the anticipated event. The individual finds it difficult to control the worry and to keep\nworrisome thoughts from interfering with attention to tasks at hand. Adults with gener-\nalized anxiety disorder often worry about everyday, routine life circumstances, such as\npossible job responsibilities, health and finances, the health of family members, misfor-\ntune to their children, or minor matters (e.g., doing household chores or being late for ap-\npointments). Children with generalized anxiety disorder tend to worry excessively about\ntheir competence or the quality of their performance. During the course of the disorder,\nthe focus of worry may shift from one concern to another.\nSeveral features distinguish generalized anxiety disorder from nonpathological anxiety.\nFirst, the worries associated with generalized anxiety disorder are excessive and typically in-\nterfere significantly with psychosocial functioning, whereas the worries of everyday life\nare not excessive and are perceived as more manageable and may be put off when more\npressing matters arise. Second, the worries associated with generalized anxiety disorder are\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder\n223\nmore pervasive, pronounced, and distressing; have longer duration; and frequently occur\nwithout precipitants. The greater the range of life circumstances about which a person\nworries (e.g., finances, children’s safety, job performance), the more likely his or her symp-\ntoms are to meet criteria for generalized anxiety disorder. Third, everyday worries are much\nless likely to be accompanied by physical symptoms (e.g., restlessness or feeling keyed up\nor on edge). Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder report subjective distress due\nto constant worry and related impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas\nof functioning.\nThe anxiety and worry are accompanied by at least three of the following additional\nsymptoms: restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty\nconcentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension, and disturbed sleep, al-\nthough only one additional symptom is required in children. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nAssociated with muscle tension, there may be trembling, twitching, feeling shaky, and\nmuscle aches or soreness. Many individuals with generalized anxiety disorder also expe-\nrience somatic symptoms (e.g., sweating, nausea, diarrhea) and an exaggerated startle re-\nsponse. Symptoms of autonomic hyperarousal (e.g., accelerated heart rate, shortness of\nbreath, dizziness) are less prominent in generalized anxiety disorder than in other anxiety\ndisorders, such as panic disorder. Other conditions that may be associated with stress (e.g.,\nirritable bowel syndrome, headaches) frequently accompany generalized anxiety disorder. \nPrevalence\nThe 12-month prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder is 0.9% among adolescents and\n2.9% among adults in the general community of the United States. The 12-month preva-\nlence for the disorder in other countries ranges from 0.4% to 3.6%. The lifetime morbid risk\nis 9.0%. Females are twice as likely as males to experience generalized anxiety disorder. The\nprevalence of the diagnosis peaks in middle age and declines across the later years of life.\nIndividuals of European descent tend to experience generalized anxiety disorder more\nfrequently than do individuals of non-European descent (i.e., Asian, African, Native\nAmerican and Pacific Islander). Furthermore, individuals from developed countries are\nmore likely than individuals from nondeveloped countries to report that they have expe-\nrienced symptoms that meet criteria for generalized anxiety disorder in their lifetime.\nDevelopment and Course\nMany individuals with generalized anxiety disorder report that they have felt anxious and\nnervous all of their lives. The median age at onset for generalized anxiety disorder is 30\nyears; however, age at onset is spread over a very broad range. The median age at onset is\nlater than that for the other anxiety disorders. The symptoms of excessive worry and anx-\niety may occur early in life but are then manifested as an anxious temperament. Onset of\nthe disorder rarely occurs prior to adolescence. The symptoms of generalized anxiety dis-\norder tend to be chronic and wax and wane across the lifespan, fluctuating between syn-\ndromal and subsyndromal forms of the disorder. Rates of full remission are very low.\nThe clinical expression of generalized anxiety disorder is relatively consistent across\nthe lifespan. The primary difference across age groups is in the content of the individual’s\nworry. Children and adolescents tend to worry more about school and sporting perfor-\nmance, whereas older adults report greater concern about the well-being of family or their\nown physical heath. Thus, the content of an individual’s worry tends to be age appropri-\nate. Younger adults experience greater severity of symptoms than do older adults.\nThe earlier in life individuals have symptoms that meet criteria for generalized anxiety\ndisorder, the more comorbidity they tend to have and the more impaired they are likely to\n224\nAnxiety Disorders\nbe. The advent of chronic physical disease can be a potent issue for excessive worry in the\nelderly. In the frail elderly, worries about safety—and especially about falling—may limit\nactivities. In those with early cognitive impairment, what appears to be excessive worry\nabout, for example, the whereabouts of things is probably better regarded as realistic\ngiven the cognitive impairment.\nIn children and adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder, the anxieties and wor-\nries often concern the quality of their performance or competence at school or in sporting\nevents, even when their performance is not being evaluated by others. There may be ex-\ncessive concerns about punctuality. They may also worry about catastrophic events, such\nas earthquakes or nuclear war. Children with the disorder may be overly conforming, per-\nfectionist, and unsure of themselves and tend to redo tasks because of excessive dissatis-\nfaction with less-than-perfect performance. They are typically overzealous in seeking\nreassurance and approval and require excessive reassurance about their performance and\nother things they are worried about.\nGeneralized anxiety disorder may be overdiagnosed in children. When this diagnosis\nis being considered in children, a thorough evaluation for the presence of other childhood\nanxiety disorders and other mental disorders should be done to determine whether the\nworries may be better explained by one of these disorders. Separation anxiety disorder, so-\ncial anxiety disorder (social phobia), and obsessive-compulsive disorder are often accom-\npanied by worries that may mimic those described in generalized anxiety disorder. For\nexample, a child with social anxiety disorder may be concerned about school performance\nbecause of fear of humiliation. Worries about illness may also be better explained by sep-\naration anxiety disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nTemperamental.\nBehavioral inhibition, negative affectivity (neuroticism), and harm\navoidance have been associated with generalized anxiety disorder.\nEnvironmental.\nAlthough childhood adversities and parental overprotection have been\nassociated with generalized anxiety disorder, no environmental factors have been identi-\nfied as specific to generalized anxiety disorder or necessary or sufficient for making the di-\nagnosis.\nGenetic and physiological.\nOne-third of the risk of experiencing generalized anxiety\ndisorder is genetic, and these genetic factors overlap with the risk of neuroticism and are\nshared with other anxiety and mood disorders, particularly major depressive disorder.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nThere is considerable cultural variation in the expression of generalized anxiety disorder.\nFor example, in some cultures, somatic symptoms predominate in the expression of the\ndisorder, whereas in other cultures cognitive symptoms tend to predominate. This differ-\nence may be more evident on initial presentation than subsequently, as more symptoms\nare reported over time. There is no information as to whether the propensity for excessive\nworrying is related to culture, although the topic being worried about can be culture spe-\ncific. It is important to consider the social and cultural context when evaluating whether\nworries about certain situations are excessive.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nIn clinical settings, generalized anxiety disorder is diagnosed somewhat more frequently\nin females than in males (about 55%–60% of those presenting with the disorder are\nfemale). In epidemiological studies, approximately two-thirds are female. Females and\nmales who experience generalized anxiety disorder appear to have similar symptoms but\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder\n225\ndemonstrate different patterns of comorbidity consistent with gender differences in the\nprevalence of disorders. In females, comorbidity is largely confined to the anxiety disor-\nders and unipolar depression, whereas in males, comorbidity is more likely to extend to\nthe substance use disorders as well.\nFunctional Consequences of \nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder\nExcessive worrying impairs the individual’s capacity to do things quickly and efficiently,\nwhether at home or at work. The worrying takes time and energy; the associated symp-\ntoms of muscle tension and feeling keyed up or on edge, tiredness, difficulty concentrat-\ning, and disturbed sleep contribute to the impairment. Importantly the excessive worrying\nmay impair the ability of individuals with generalized anxiety disorder to encourage con-\nfidence in their children.\nGeneralized anxiety disorder is associated with significant disability and distress that is\nindependent of comorbid disorders, and most non-institutionalized adults with the disorder\nare moderately to seriously disabled. Generalized anxiety disorder accounts for 110 mil-\nlion disability days per annum in the U.S. population.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nAnxiety disorder due to another medical condition.\nThe diagnosis of anxiety disorder\nassociated with another medical condition should be assigned if the individual’s anxiety\nand worry are judged, based on history, laboratory findings, or physical examination, to\nbe a physiological effect of another specific medical condition (e.g., pheochromocytoma,\nhyperthyroidism). \nSubstance\/medication-induced anxiety disorder.\nA substance\/medication-induced\nanxiety disorder is distinguished from generalized anxiety disorder by the fact that a sub-\nstance or medication (e.g., a drug of abuse, exposure to a toxin) is judged to be etiologically\nrelated to the anxiety. For example, severe anxiety that occurs only in the context of heavy\ncoffee consumption would be diagnosed as caffeine-induced anxiety disorder.\nSocial anxiety disorder.\nIndividuals with social anxiety disorder often have anticipa-\ntory anxiety that is focused on upcoming social situations in which they must perform or\nbe evaluated by others, whereas individuals with generalized anxiety disorder worry,\nwhether or not they are being evaluated. \nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nSeveral features distinguish the excessive worry of\ngeneralized anxiety disorder from the obsessional thoughts of obsessive-compulsive dis-\norder. In generalized anxiety disorder the focus of the worry is about forthcoming prob-\nlems, and it is the excessiveness of the worry about future events that is abnormal. In\nobsessive-compulsive disorder, the obsessions are inappropriate ideas that take the form of\nintrusive and unwanted thoughts, urges, or images. \nPosttraumatic stress disorder and adjustment disorders.\nAnxiety is invariably pres-\nent in posttraumatic stress disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder is not diagnosed if the\nanxiety and worry are better explained by symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder.\nAnxiety may also be present in adjustment disorder, but this residual category should be\nused only when the criteria are not met for any other disorder (including generalized anx-\niety disorder). Moreover, in adjustment disorders, the anxiety occurs in response to an\nidentifiable stressor within 3 months of the onset of the stressor and does not persist for\nmore than 6 months after the termination of the stressor or its consequences. \nDepressive, bipolar, and psychotic disorders.\nGeneralized anxiety\/worry is a common\nassociated feature of depressive, bipolar, and psychotic disorders and should not be di-\n226\nAnxiety Disorders\nagnosed separately if the excessive worry has occurred only during the course of these\nconditions.\nComorbidity\nIndividuals whose presentation meets criteria for generalized anxiety disorder are likely\nto have met, or currently meet, criteria for other anxiety and unipolar depressive disor-\nders. The neuroticism or emotional liability that underpins this pattern of comorbidity is\nassociated with temperamental antecedents and genetic and environmental risk factors\nshared between these disorders, although independent pathways are also possible. Co-\nmorbidity with substance use, conduct, psychotic, neurodevelopmental, and neurocogni-\ntive disorders is less common."}

The involved substance\/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Crite-\nrion A.\nC. The disturbance is not better explained by an anxiety disorder that is not substance\/\nmedication-induced. Such evidence of an independent anxiety disorder could include\nthe following:\nThe symptoms precede the onset of the substance\/medication use; the symptoms\npersist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of\nacute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the\nexistence of an independent non-substance\/medication-induced anxiety disorder\n(e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance\/medication-related episodes).\nD. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.\nE. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning. \nNote: This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or\nsubstance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical\npicture and they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention. \nCoding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance\/medica-\ntion]-induced anxiety disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM\ncode depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for\nthe same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the sub-\nstance-induced anxiety disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should\nrecord “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced anxiety disorder\n(e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced anxiety disorder”). If a moderate or\nsevere substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced anxiety disorder,\nthe 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use\ndisorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid\nsubstance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-\nSubstance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder\n227\ntime heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician\nshould record only the substance-induced anxiety disorder.\nSpecify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders” for di-\nagnoses associated with substance class):\nWith onset during intoxication: This specifier applies if criteria are met for intoxica-\ntion with the substance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.\nWith onset during withdrawal: This specifier applies if criteria are met for withdrawal\nfrom the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.\nWith onset after medication use: Symptoms may appear either at initiation of medi-\ncation or after a modification or change in use.\nRecording Procedures\nICD-9-CM.\nThe name of the substance\/medication-induced anxiety disorder begins\nwith the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, salbutamol) that is presumed to be causing the\nanxiety symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria\nset, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes\n(e.g., salbutamol), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which\na substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is un-\nknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used.\nThe name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during in-\ntoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset during medication use). Unlike the record-\ning procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance-induced disorder and\nsubstance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given\nfor the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of anxiety symptoms occurring dur-\ning withdrawal in a man with a severe lorazepam use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.89 loraz-\nepam-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during withdrawal. An additional diagnosis of\n304.10 severe lorazepam use disorder is also given.

The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria\nset, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use\ndisorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., salbutamol), the code\nfor “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an\netiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown\nsubstance” should be used.\nWhen recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any)\nis listed first, followed by the word “with,” followed by the name of the substance-induced\nanxiety disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication,\nonset during withdrawal, with onset during medication use). For example, in the case of\nanxiety symptoms occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe lorazepam use dis-\norder, the diagnosis is F13.280 severe lorazepam use disorder with lorazepam-induced\nanxiety disorder, with onset during withdrawal. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid se-\nvere lorazepam use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced anxiety disorder occurs\nwithout a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance),\nno accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F16.980 psilocybin-induced anxi-\nety disorder, with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to\nplay a significant role in the development of anxiety symptoms, each should be listed sep-\narately (e.g., F15.280 severe methylphenidate use disorder with methylphenidate-induced\nanxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication; F19.980 salbutamol-induced anxiety dis-\norder, with onset after medication use).\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential features of substance\/medication-induced anxiety disorder are prominent\nsymptoms of panic or anxiety (Criterion A) that are judged to be due to the effects of a sub-\nstance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, or a toxin exposure). The panic or anxiety symp-\ntoms must have developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or\nafter exposure to a medication, and the substances or medications must be capable of pro-\nducing the symptoms (Criterion B2). Substance\/medication-induced anxiety disorder\ndue to a prescribed treatment for a mental disorder or another medical condition must\nhave its onset while the individual is receiving the medication (or during withdrawal, if a\nwithdrawal is associated with the medication). Once the treatment is discontinued, the\npanic or anxiety symptoms will usually improve or remit within days to several weeks to\na month (depending on the half-life of the substance\/medication and the presence of with-\ndrawal). The diagnosis of substance\/medication-induced anxiety disorder should not be\ngiven if the onset of the panic or anxiety symptoms precedes the substance\/medication in-\ntoxication or withdrawal, or if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (i.e.,\nusually longer than 1 month) from the time of severe intoxication or withdrawal. If the\npanic or anxiety symptoms persist for substantial periods of time, other causes for the\nsymptoms should be considered.\nThe substance\/medication-induced anxiety disorder diagnosis should be made in-\nstead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the\nsymptoms in Criterion A are predominant in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe\nto warrant independent clinical attention.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nPanic or anxiety can occur in association with intoxication with the following classes of sub-\nstances: alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, phencyclidine, other hallucinogens, inhalants, stimu-\nSubstance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder\n229\nlants (including cocaine), and other (or unknown) substances. Panic or anxiety can occur in\nassociation with withdrawal from the following classes of substances: alcohol; opioids; sed-\natives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics; stimulants (including cocaine); and other (or unknown)\nsubstances. Some medications that evoke anxiety symptoms include anesthetics and anal-\ngesics, sympathomimetics or other bronchodilators, anticholinergics, insulin, thyroid prep-\narations, oral contraceptives, antihistamines, antiparkinsonian medications, corticosteroids,\nantihypertensive and cardiovascular medications, anticonvulsants, lithium carbonate, an-\ntipsychotic medications, and antidepressant medications. Heavy metals and toxins (e.g.,\norganophosphate insecticide, nerve gases, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, volatile sub-\nstances such as gasoline and paint) may also cause panic or anxiety symptoms.\nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of substance\/medication-induced anxiety disorder is not clear. General\npopulation data suggest that it may be rare, with a 12-month prevalence of approximately\n0.002%. However, in clinical populations, the prevalence is likely to be higher. \nDiagnostic Markers\nLaboratory assessments (e.g., urine toxicology) may be useful to measure substance intox-\nication as part of an assessment for substance\/medication-induced anxiety disorder.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nSubstance intoxication and substance withdrawal.\nAnxiety symptoms commonly oc-\ncur in substance intoxication and substance withdrawal. The diagnosis of the substance-\nspecific intoxication or substance-specific withdrawal will usually suffice to categorize the\nsymptom presentation. A diagnosis of substance\/medication-induced anxiety disorder\nshould be made in addition to substance intoxication or substance withdrawal when the\npanic or anxiety symptoms are predominant in the clinical picture and are sufficiently se-\nvere to warrant independent clinical attention. For example, panic or anxiety symptoms\nare characteristic of alcohol withdrawal. \nAnxiety disorder (i.e., not induced by a substance\/medication).\nSubstance\/medication-\ninduced anxiety disorder is judged to be etiologically related to the substance\/medication.\nSubstance\/medication-induced anxiety disorder is distinguished from a primary anxiety\ndisorder based on the onset, course, and other factors with respect to substances\/medica-\ntions. For drugs of abuse, there must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or\nlaboratory findings for use, intoxication, or withdrawal. Substance\/medication-induced\nanxiety disorders arise only in association with intoxication or withdrawal states, whereas\nprimary anxiety disorders may precede the onset of substance\/medication use. The pres-\nence of features that are atypical of a primary anxiety disorder, such as atypical age at onset\n(e.g., onset of panic disorder after age 45 years) or symptoms (e.g., atypical panic attack\nsymptoms such as true vertigo, loss of balance, loss of consciousness, loss of bladder con-\ntrol, headaches, slurred speech) may suggest a substance\/medication-induced etiology. A\nprimary anxiety disorder diagnosis is warranted if the panic or anxiety symptoms persist\nfor a substantial period of time (about 1 month or longer) after the end of the substance in-\ntoxication or acute withdrawal or there is a history of an anxiety disorder.\nDelirium.\nIf panic or anxiety symptoms occur exclusively during the course of delirium,\nthey are considered to be an associated feature of the delirium and are not diagnosed sep-\narately. \nAnxiety disorder due to another medical condition.\nIf the panic or anxiety symptoms\nare attributed to the physiological consequences of another medical condition (i.e., rather\nthan to the medication taken for the medical condition), anxiety disorder due to another\n230\nAnxiety Disorders\nmedical condition should be diagnosed. The history often provides the basis for such a\njudgment. At times, a change in the treatment for the other medical condition (e.g., med-\nication substitution or discontinuation) may be needed to determine whether the medica-\ntion is the causative agent (in which case the symptoms may be better explained by\nsubstance\/medication-induced anxiety disorder). If the disturbance is attributable to both\nanother medical condition and substance use, both diagnoses (i.e., anxiety disorder due to\nanother medical condition and substance\/medication-induced anxiety disorder) may be\ngiven. When there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the panic or anxiety symp-\ntoms are attributable to a substance\/medication or to another medical condition or are pri-\nmary (i.e., not attributable to either a substance or another medical condition), a diagnosis\nof other specified or unspecified anxiety disorder would be indicated."}

The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder. \nD. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. \nE. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning.\nCoding note: Include the name of the other medical condition within the name of the men-\ntal disorder (e.g., 293.84 [F06.4] anxiety disorder due to pheochromocytoma). The other\nmedical condition should be coded and listed separately immediately before the anxiety\ndisorder due to the medical condition (e.g., 227.0 [D35.00] pheochromocytoma; 293.84\n[F06.4] anxiety disorder due to pheochromocytoma.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition is clinically signifi-\ncant anxiety that is judged to be best explained as a physiological effect of another medical con-\ndition. Symptoms can include prominent anxiety symptoms or panic attacks (Criterion A).\nThe judgment that the symptoms are best explained by the associated physical condition must\nbe based on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings (Criterion\nB). Additionally, it must be judged that the symptoms are not better accounted for by another\nmental disorder, in particular, adjustment disorder, with anxiety, in which the stressor is the\nmedical condition (Criterion C). In this case, an individual with adjustment disorder is espe-\ncially distressed about the meaning or the consequences of the associated medical condition.\nBy contrast, there is often a prominent physical component to the anxiety (e.g., shortness of\nbreath) when the anxiety is due to another medical condition. The diagnosis is not made if the\nanxiety symptoms occur only during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The anxiety symp-\ntoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other\nimportant areas of functioning (Criterion E).\nIn determining whether the anxiety symptoms are attributable to another medical con-\ndition, the clinician must first establish the presence of the medical condition. Further-\nmore, it must be established that anxiety symptoms can be etiologically related to the\nmedical condition through a physiological mechanism before making a judgment that this\nis the best explanation for the symptoms in a specific individual. A careful and compre-\nAnxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\n231\nhensive assessment of multiple factors is necessary to make this judgment. Several aspects\nof the clinical presentation should be considered: 1) the presence of a clear temporal asso-\nciation between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of the medical condition and the anx-\niety symptoms; 2) the presence of features that are atypical of a primary anxiety disorder\n(e.g., atypical age at onset or course); and 3) evidence in the literature that a known phys-\niological mechanism (e.g., hyperthyroidism) causes anxiety. In addition, the disturbance\nmust not be better explained by a primary anxiety disorder, a substance\/medication-\ninduced anxiety disorder, or another primary mental disorder (e.g., adjustment disorder). \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nA number of medical conditions are known to include anxiety as a symptomatic manifes-\ntation. Examples include endocrine disease (e.g., hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma,\nhypoglycemia, hyperadrenocortisolism), cardiovascular disorders (e.g., congestive heart\nfailure, pulmonary embolism, arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation), respiratory illness\n(e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pneumonia), metabolic distur-\nbances (e.g., vitamin B12 deficiency, porphyria), and neurological illness (e.g., neoplasms,\nvestibular dysfunction, encephalitis, seizure disorders). Anxiety due to another medical\ncondition is diagnosed when the medical condition is known to induce anxiety and when\nthe medical condition preceded the onset of the anxiety.\nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition is unclear. There ap-\npears to be an elevated prevalence of anxiety disorders among individuals with a variety\nof medical conditions, including asthma, hypertension, ulcers, and arthritis. However, this\nincreased prevalence may be due to reasons other than the anxiety disorder directly caus-\ning the medical condition. \nDevelopment and Course\nThe development and course of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition gen-\nerally follows the course of the underlying illness. This diagnosis is not meant to include\nprimary anxiety disorders that arise in the context of chronic medical illness. This is im-\nportant to consider with older adults, who may experience chronic medical illness and\nthen develop independent anxiety disorders secondary to the chronic medical illness.\nDiagnostic Markers\nLaboratory assessments and\/or medical examinations are necessary to confirm the diag-\nnosis of the associated medical condition. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nDelirium.\nA separate diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition is\nnot given if the anxiety disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium.\nHowever, a diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition may be given\nin addition to a diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) if the etiology of\nanxiety is judged to be a physiological consequence of the pathological process causing the\nneurocognitive disorder and if anxiety is a prominent part of the clinical presentation. \nMixed presentation of symptoms (e.g., mood and anxiety).\nIf the presentation includes\na mix of different types of symptoms, the specific mental disorder due to another medical\ncondition depends on which symptoms predominate in the clinical picture.\nSubstance\/medication-induced anxiety disorder.\nIf there is evidence of recent or pro-\nlonged substance use (including medications with psychoactive effects), withdrawal from\n232\nAnxiety Disorders\na substance, or exposure to a toxin, a substance\/medication-induced anxiety disorder\nshould be considered. Certain medications are known to increase anxiety (e.g., corticoste-\nroids, estrogens, metoclopramide), and when this is the case, the medication may be the\nmost likely etiology, although it may be difficult to distinguish whether the anxiety is at-\ntributable to the medications or to the medical illness itself. When a diagnosis of substance-\ninduced anxiety is being made in relation to recreational or nonprescribed drugs, it may be\nuseful to obtain a urine or blood drug screen or other appropriate laboratory evaluation.\nSymptoms that occur during or shortly after (i.e., within 4 weeks of) substance intoxication\nor withdrawal or after medication use may be especially indicative of a substance\/medi-\ncation-induced anxiety disorder, depending on the type, duration, or amount of the sub-\nstance used. If the disturbance is associated with both another medical condition and\nsubstance use, both diagnoses (i.e., anxiety disorder due to another medical condition and\nsubstance\/medication-induced anxiety disorder) can be given. Features such as onset af-\nter age 45 years or the presence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack (e.g., vertigo,\nloss of consciousness, loss of bladder or bowel control, slurred speech, amnesia) suggest\nthe possibility that another medical condition or a substance may be causing the panic at-\ntack symptoms.\nAnxiety disorder (not due to a known medical condition).\nAnxiety disorder due to an-\nother medical condition should be distinguished from other anxiety disorders (especially\npanic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder). In other anxiety disorders, no specific\nand direct causative physiological mechanisms associated with another medical condition\ncan be demonstrated. Late age at onset, atypical symptoms, and the absence of a personal\nor family history of anxiety disorders suggest the need for a thorough assessment to rule\nout the diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition. Anxiety disorders\ncan exacerbate or pose increased risk for medical conditions such as cardiovascular events\nand myocardial infarction and should not be diagnosed as anxiety disorder due to another\nmedical condition in these cases.\nIllness anxiety disorder.\nAnxiety disorder due to another medical condition should be\ndistinguished from illness anxiety disorder. Illness anxiety disorder is characterized by\nworry about illness, concern about pain, and bodily preoccupations. In the case of illness\nanxiety disorder, individuals may or may not have diagnosed medical conditions. Al-\nthough an individual with illness anxiety disorder and a diagnosed medical condition is\nlikely to experience anxiety about the medical condition, the medical condition is not\nphysiologically related to the anxiety symptoms. \nAdjustment disorders.\nAnxiety disorder due to another medical condition should be\ndistinguished from adjustment disorders, with anxiety, or with anxiety and depressed\nmood. Adjustment disorder is warranted when individuals experience a maladaptive re-\nsponse to the stress of having another medical condition. The reaction to stress usually\nconcerns the meaning or consequences of the stress, as compared with the experience of\nanxiety or mood symptoms that occur as a physiological consequence of the other medical\ncondition. In adjustment disorder, the anxiety symptoms are typically related to coping\nwith the stress of having a general medical condition, whereas in anxiety disorder due to\nanother medical condition, individuals are more likely to have prominent physical symp-\ntoms and to be focused on issues other than the stress of the illness itself. \nAssociated feature of another mental disorder.\nAnxiety symptoms may be an associ-\nated feature of another mental disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa). \nOther specified or unspecified anxiety disorder.\nThis diagnosis is given if it cannot be\ndetermined whether the anxiety symptoms are primary, substance-induced, or associated\nwith another medical condition.\nOther Specified Anxiety Disorder\n233"}
