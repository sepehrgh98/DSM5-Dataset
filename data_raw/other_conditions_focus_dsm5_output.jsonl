This category should be used when\nthe main focus of clinical attention is to address the quality of the parent-child relationship\nor when the quality of the parent-child relationship is affecting the course, prognosis, or\ntreatment of a mental or other medical disorder.

Examples of behavioral problems include inadequate parental control, supervision,\nand involvement with the child; parental overprotection; excessive parental pressure; ar-\nguments that escalate to threats of physical violence; and avoidance without resolution of\nproblems. Cognitive problems may include negative attributions of the other’s intentions,\nhostility toward or scapegoating of the other, and unwarranted feelings of estrangement.\nAffective problems may include feelings of sadness, apathy, or anger about the other in-\ndividual in the relationship.

Ex-\namples of lifestyle problems include lack of physical exercise, inappropriate diet, high-risk\nsexual behavior, and poor sleep hygiene. A problem that is attributable to a symptom of a\nmental disorder should not be coded unless that problem is a specific focus of treatment or\ndirectly affects the course, prognosis, or treatment of the individual. In such cases, both the\nmental disorder and the lifestyle problem should be coded.\nV71.01 (Z72.811)\nAdult Antisocial Behavior\nThis category can be used when the focus of clinical attention is adult antisocial behavior\nthat is not due to a mental disorder (e.g., conduct disorder, antisocial personality disor-\nder). Examples include the behavior of some professional thieves, racketeers, or dealers in\nillegal substances.\nV71.02 (Z72.810)\nChild or Adolescent Antisocial Behavior\nThis category can be used when the focus of clinical attention is antisocial behavior in a\nchild or adolescent that is not due to a mental disorder (e.g., intermittent explosive disor-\nder, conduct disorder). Examples include isolated antisocial acts by children or adoles-\ncents (not a pattern of antisocial behavior).\nProblems Related to Access to Medical \nand Other Health Care\nV63.9 (Z75.3)\nUnavailability or Inaccessibility of Health Care Facilities\nV63.8 (Z75.4)\nUnavailability or Inaccessibility of Other Helping Agencies\nNonadherence to Medical Treatment\nV15.81 (Z91.19)\nNonadherence to Medical Treatment\nThis category can be used when the focus of clinical attention is nonadherence to an im-\nportant aspect of treatment for a mental disorder or another medical condition. Reasons\nfor such nonadherence may include discomfort resulting from treatment (e.g., medication\nside effects), expense of treatment, personal value judgments or religious or cultural be-\nliefs about the proposed treatment, age-related debility, and the presence of a mental dis-\norder (e.g., schizophrenia, personality disorder). This category should be used only when\nthe problem is sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention and does not\nmeet diagnostic criteria for psychological factors affecting other medical conditions.\n278.00 (E66.9)\nOverweight or Obesity\nThis category may be used when overweight or obesity is a focus of clinical attention.\nV65.2 (Z76.5)\nMalingering\nThe essential feature of malingering is the intentional production of false or grossly exag-\ngerated physical or psychological symptoms, motivated by external incentives such as\navoiding military duty, avoiding work, obtaining financial compensation, evading crimi-\nnal prosecution, or obtaining drugs. Under some circumstances, malingering may repre-\nOther Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention\n727\nsent adaptive behavior—for example, feigning illness while a captive of the enemy during\nwartime. Malingering should be strongly suspected if any combination of the following is\nnoted:\n1. Medicolegal context of presentation (e.g., the individual is referred by an attorney to\nthe clinician for examination, or the individual self-refers while litigation or criminal\ncharges are pending).\n2. Marked discrepancy between the individual’s claimed stress or disability and the ob-\njective findings and observations.\n3. Lack of cooperation during the diagnostic evaluation and in complying with the pre-\nscribed treatment regimen.\n4. The presence of antisocial personality disorder.\nMalingering differs from factitious disorder in that the motivation for the symptom\nproduction in malingering is an external incentive, whereas in factitious disorder external\nincentives are absent. Malingering is differentiated from conversion disorder and somatic\nsymptom–related mental disorders by the intentional production of symptoms and by the\nobvious external incentives associated with it. Definite evidence of feigning (such as clear\nevidence that loss of function is present during the examination but not at home) would\nsuggest a diagnosis of factitious disorder if the individual’s apparent aim is to assume the\nsick role, or malingering if it is to obtain an incentive, such as money.\nV40.31 (Z91.83)\nWandering Associated With a Mental Disorder\nThis category is used for individuals with a mental disorder whose desire to walk about\nleads to significant clinical management or safety concerns. For example, individuals with\nmajor neurocognitive or neurodevelopmental disorders may experience a restless urge to\nwander that places them at risk for falls and causes them to leave supervised settings with-\nout needed accompaniment. This category excludes individuals whose intent is to escape\nan unwanted housing situation (e.g., children who are running away from home, patients\nwho no longer wish to remain in the hospital) or those who walk or pace as a result of med-\nication-induced akathisia.\nCoding note: First code associated mental disorder (e.g., major neurocognitive disor-\nder, autism spectrum disorder), then code V40.31 (Z91.83) wandering associated with\n[specific mental disorder].\nV62.89 (R41.83)\nBorderline Intellectual Functioning\nThis category can be used when an individual’s borderline intellectual functioning is the fo-\ncus of clinical attention or has an impact on the individual’s treatment or prognosis. Differ-\nentiating borderline intellectual functioning and mild intellectual disability (intellectual\ndevelopmental disorder) requires careful assessment of intellectual and adaptive functions\nand their discrepancies, particularly in the presence of co-occurring mental disorders that\nmay affect patient compliance with standardized testing procedures (e.g., schizophrenia or\nattention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder with severe impulsivity).\nThis page intentionally left blank"}
