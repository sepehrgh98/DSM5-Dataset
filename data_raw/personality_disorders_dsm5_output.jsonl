The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to\nadolescence or early adulthood.\nE. The enduring pattern is not better explained as a manifestation or consequence of an-\nother mental disorder.\nF. The enduring pattern is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,\na drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., head trauma).\nDiagnostic Features\nPersonality traits are enduring patterns of perceiving, relating to, and thinking about the en-\nvironment and oneself that are exhibited in a wide range of social and personal contexts.\nOnly when personality traits are inflexible and maladaptive and cause significant func-\ntional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute personality disorders. The essen-\ntial feature of a personality disorder is an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior\nthat deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual’s culture and is manifested\nin at least two of the following areas: cognition, affectivity, interpersonal functioning, or im-\npulse control (Criterion A). This enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad\nrange of personal and social situations (Criterion B) and leads to clinically significant dis-\ntress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Crite-\nrion C). The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least\nto adolescence or early adulthood (Criterion D). The pattern is not better explained as a\nmanifestation or consequence of another mental disorder (Criterion E) and is not attribut-\nable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, exposure\nto a toxin) or another medical condition (e.g., head trauma) (Criterion F). Specific diagnostic\ncriteria are also provided for each of the personality disorders included in this chapter. \nThe diagnosis of personality disorders requires an evaluation of the individual’s long-\nterm patterns of functioning, and the particular personality features must be evident by\nearly adulthood. The personality traits that define these disorders must also be distin-\nguished from characteristics that emerge in response to specific situational stressors or\nmore transient mental states (e.g., bipolar, depressive, or anxiety disorders; substance in-\ntoxication). The clinician should assess the stability of personality traits over time and\nacross different situations. Although a single interview with the individual is sometimes\nsufficient for making the diagnosis, it is often necessary to conduct more than one inter-\nview and to space these over time. Assessment can also be complicated by the fact that the\ncharacteristics that define a personality disorder may not be considered problematic by\nthe individual (i.e., the traits are often ego-syntonic). To help overcome this difficulty, sup-\nplementary information from other informants may be helpful.\nDevelopment and Course\nThe features of a personality disorder usually become recognizable during adolescence or\nearly adult life. By definition, a personality disorder is an enduring pattern of thinking,\nfeeling, and behaving that is relatively stable over time. Some types of personality disorder\n(notably, antisocial and borderline personality disorders) tend to become less evident or to\nremit with age, whereas this appears to be less true for some other types (e.g., obsessive-\ncompulsive and schizotypal personality disorders).\nPersonality disorder categories may be applied with children or adolescents in those\nrelatively unusual instances in which the individual’s particular maladaptive personality\ntraits appear to be pervasive, persistent, and unlikely to be limited to a particular devel-\nopmental stage or another mental disorder. It should be recognized that the traits of a per-\nsonality disorder that appear in childhood will often not persist unchanged into adult life.\nFor a personality disorder to be diagnosed in an individual younger than 18 years, the fea-\ntures must have been present for at least 1 year. The one exception to this is antisocial per-\n648\nPersonality Disorders\nsonality disorder, which cannot be diagnosed in individuals younger than 18 years. Al-\nthough, by definition, a personality disorder requires an onset no later than early\nadulthood, individuals may not come to clinical attention until relatively late in life. A per-\nsonality disorder may be exacerbated following the loss of significant supporting persons\n(e.g., a spouse) or previously stabilizing social situations (e.g., a job). However, the devel-\nopment of a change in personality in middle adulthood or later life warrants a thorough\nevaluation to determine the possible presence of a personality change due to another med-\nical condition or an unrecognized substance use disorder.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nJudgments about personality functioning must take into account the individual’s ethnic, cul-\ntural, and social background. Personality disorders should not be confused with problems as-\nsociated with acculturation following immigration or with the expression of habits, customs,\nor religious and political values professed by the individual’s culture of origin. It is useful for\nthe clinician, especially when evaluating someone from a different background, to obtain ad-\nditional information from informants who are familiar with the person’s cultural background.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nCertain personality disorders (e.g., antisocial personality disorder) are diagnosed more\nfrequently in males. Others (e.g., borderline, histrionic, and dependent personality disor-\nders) are diagnosed more frequently in females. Although these differences in prevalence\nprobably reflect real gender differences in the presence of such patterns, clinicians must be\ncautious not to overdiagnose or underdiagnose certain personality disorders in females or\nin males because of social stereotypes about typical gender roles and behaviors.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther mental disorders and personality traits.\nMany of the specific criteria for the per-\nsonality disorders describe features (e.g., suspiciousness, dependency, insensitivity) that\nare also characteristic of episodes of other mental disorders. A personality disorder should\nbe diagnosed only when the defining characteristics appeared before early adulthood, are\ntypical of the individual’s long-term functioning, and do not occur exclusively during an\nepisode of another mental disorder. It may be particularly difficult (and not particularly\nuseful) to distinguish personality disorders from persistent mental disorders such as per-\nsistent depressive disorder that have an early onset and an enduring, relatively stable\ncourse. Some personality disorders may have a “spectrum” relationship to other mental\ndisorders (e.g., schizotypal personality disorder with schizophrenia; avoidant personality\ndisorder with social anxiety disorder [social phobia]) based on phenomenological or bio-\nlogical similarities or familial aggregation.\nPersonality disorders must be distinguished from personality traits that do not reach\nthe threshold for a personality disorder. Personality traits are diagnosed as a personality\ndisorder only when they are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant\nfunctional impairment or subjective distress.\nPsychotic disorders.\nFor the three personality disorders that may be related to the psy-\nchotic disorders (i.e., paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal), there is an exclusion criterion\nstating that the pattern of behavior must not have occurred exclusively during the course\nof schizophrenia, a bipolar or depressive disorder with psychotic features, or another psy-\nchotic disorder. When an individual has a persistent mental disorder (e.g., schizophrenia)\nthat was preceded by a preexisting personality disorder, the personality disorder should\nalso be recorded, followed by “premorbid” in parentheses.\nAnxiety and depressive disorders.\nThe clinician must be cautious in diagnosing per-\nsonality disorders during an episode of a depressive disorder or an anxiety disorder, be-\nParanoid Personality Disorder\n649\ncause these conditions may have cross-sectional symptom features that mimic personality\ntraits and may make it more difficult to evaluate retrospectively the individual’s long-term\npatterns of functioning. \nPosttraumatic stress disorder.\nWhen personality changes emerge and persist after an\nindividual has been exposed to extreme stress, a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder\nshould be considered. \nSubstance use disorders.\nWhen an individual has a substance use disorder, it is impor-\ntant not to make a personality disorder diagnosis based solely on behaviors that are con-\nsequences of substance intoxication or withdrawal or that are associated with activities in\nthe service of sustaining substance use (e.g., antisocial behavior). \nPersonality change due to another medical condition.\nWhen enduring changes in per-\nsonality arise as a result of the physiological effects of another medical condition (e.g.,\nbrain tumor), a diagnosis of personality change due to another medical condition should\nbe considered.\nCluster A Personality Disorders"}

This\npattern begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts.\n650\nPersonality Disorders\nIndividuals with this disorder assume that other people will exploit, harm, or deceive\nthem, even if no evidence exists to support this expectation (Criterion A1). They suspect on\nthe basis of little or no evidence that others are plotting against them and may attack them\nsuddenly, at any time and without reason. They often feel that they have been deeply and\nirreversibly injured by another person or persons even when there is no objective evidence\nfor this. They are preoccupied with unjustified doubts about the loyalty or trustworthiness\nof their friends and associates, whose actions are minutely scrutinized for evidence of hos-\ntile intentions (Criterion A2). Any perceived deviation from trustworthiness or loyalty\nserves to support their underlying assumptions. They are so amazed when a friend or as-\nsociate shows loyalty that they cannot trust or believe it. If they get into trouble, they ex-\npect that friends and associates will either attack or ignore them.\nIndividuals with paranoid personality disorder are reluctant to confide in or become\nclose to others because they fear that the information they share will be used against them\n(Criterion A3). They may refuse to answer personal questions, saying that the information\nis “nobody’s business.” They read hidden meanings that are demeaning and threatening\ninto benign remarks or events (Criterion A4). For example, an individual with this disor-\nder may misinterpret an honest mistake by a store clerk as a deliberate attempt to short-\nchange, or view a casual humorous remark by a co-worker as a serious character attack.\nCompliments are often misinterpreted (e.g., a compliment on a new acquisition is mis-\ninterpreted as a criticism for selfishness; a compliment on an accomplishment is misinter-\npreted as an attempt to coerce more and better performance). They may view an offer of\nhelp as a criticism that they are not doing well enough on their own.\nIndividuals with this disorder persistently bear grudges and are unwilling to forgive\nthe insults, injuries, or slights that they think they have received (Criterion A5). Minor\nslights arouse major hostility, and the hostile feelings persist for a long time. Because they\nare constantly vigilant to the harmful intentions of others, they very often feel that their\ncharacter or reputation has been attacked or that they have been slighted in some other\nway. They are quick to counterattack and react with anger to perceived insults (Criterion\nA6). Individuals with this disorder may be pathologically jealous, often suspecting that\ntheir spouse or sexual partner is unfaithful without any adequate justification (Criterion\nA7). They may gather trivial and circumstantial “evidence” to support their jealous beliefs.\nThey want to maintain complete control of intimate relationships to avoid being betrayed\nand may constantly question and challenge the whereabouts, actions, intentions, and fi-\ndelity of their spouse or partner.\nParanoid personality disorder should not be diagnosed if the pattern of behavior oc-\ncurs exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar disorder or depressive dis-\norder with psychotic features, or another psychotic disorder, or if it is attributable to the\nphysiological effects of a neurological (e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy) or another medical\ncondition (Criterion B).\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with paranoid personality disorder are generally difficult to get along with\nand often have problems with close relationships. Their excessive suspiciousness and hos-\ntility may be expressed in overt argumentativeness, in recurrent complaining, or by quiet,\napparently hostile aloofness. Because they are hypervigilant for potential threats, they\nmay act in a guarded, secretive, or devious manner and appear to be “cold” and lacking in\ntender feelings. Although they may appear to be objective, rational, and unemotional, they\nmore often display a labile range of affect, with hostile, stubborn, and sarcastic expressions\npredominating. Their combative and suspicious nature may elicit a hostile response in\nothers, which then serves to confirm their original expectations.\nBecause individuals with paranoid personality disorder lack trust in others, they have\nan excessive need to be self-sufficient and a strong sense of autonomy. They also need to\nParanoid Personality Disorder\n651\nhave a high degree of control over those around them. They are often rigid, critical of oth-\ners, and unable to collaborate, although they have great difficulty accepting criticism them-\nselves. They may blame others for their own shortcomings. Because of their quickness to\ncounterattack in response to the threats they perceive around them, they may be litigious\nand frequently become involved in legal disputes. Individuals with this disorder seek to\nconfirm their preconceived negative notions regarding people or situations they encounter,\nattributing malevolent motivations to others that are projections of their own fears. They\nmay exhibit thinly hidden, unrealistic grandiose fantasies, are often attuned to issues of\npower and rank, and tend to develop negative stereotypes of others, particularly those\nfrom population groups distinct from their own. Attracted by simplistic formulations of the\nworld, they are often wary of ambiguous situations. They may be perceived as “fanatics”\nand form tightly knit “cults” or groups with others who share their paranoid belief systems.\nParticularly in response to stress, individuals with this disorder may experience very\nbrief psychotic episodes (lasting minutes to hours). In some instances, paranoid personal-\nity disorder may appear as the premorbid antecedent of delusional disorder or schizo-\nphrenia. Individuals with paranoid personality disorder may develop major depressive\ndisorder and may be at increased risk for agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive dis-\norder. Alcohol and other substance use disorders frequently occur. The most common co-\noccurring personality disorders appear to be schizotypal, schizoid, narcissistic, avoidant,\nand borderline.\nPrevalence\nA prevalence estimate for paranoid personality based on a probability subsample from\nPart II of the National Comorbidity Survey Replication suggests a prevalence of 2.3%,\nwhile the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions data suggest\na prevalence of paranoid personality disorder of 4.4%.\nDevelopment and Course \nParanoid personality disorder may be first apparent in childhood and adolescence with\nsolitariness, poor peer relationships, social anxiety, underachievement in school, hyper-\nsensitivity, peculiar thoughts and language, and idiosyncratic fantasies. These children\nmay appear to be “odd” or “eccentric” and attract teasing. In clinical samples, this disorder\nappears to be more commonly diagnosed in males.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nGenetic and physiological.\nThere is some evidence for an increased prevalence of par-\nanoid personality disorder in relatives of probands with schizophrenia and for a more spe-\ncific familial relationship with delusional disorder, persecutory type.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nSome behaviors that are influenced by sociocultural contexts or specific life circumstances\nmay be erroneously labeled paranoid and may even be reinforced by the process of clinical\nevaluation. Members of minority groups, immigrants, political and economic refugees, or\nindividuals of different ethnic backgrounds may display guarded or defensive behaviors\nbecause of unfamiliarity (e.g., language barriers or lack of knowledge of rules and regula-\ntions) or in response to the perceived neglect or indifference of the majority society. These\nbehaviors can, in turn, generate anger and frustration in those who deal with these indi-\nviduals, thus setting up a vicious cycle of mutual mistrust, which should not be confused\nwith paranoid personality disorder. Some ethnic groups also display culturally related be-\nhaviors that can be misinterpreted as paranoid.\n652\nPersonality Disorders\nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther mental disorders with psychotic symptoms.\nParanoid personality disorder can\nbe distinguished from delusional disorder, persecutory type; schizophrenia; and a bipolar or\ndepressive disorder with psychotic features because these disorders are all characterized by a\nperiod of persistent psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions and hallucinations). For an additional\ndiagnosis of paranoid personality disorder to be given, the personality disorder must have\nbeen present before the onset of psychotic symptoms and must persist when the psychotic\nsymptoms are in remission. When an individual has another persistent mental disorder (e.g.,\nschizophrenia) that was preceded by paranoid personality disorder, paranoid personality dis-\norder should also be recorded, followed by “premorbid” in parentheses.\nPersonality change due to another medical condition.\nParanoid personality disorder\nmust be distinguished from personality change due to another medical condition, in\nwhich the traits that emerge are attributable to the direct effects of another medical condi-\ntion on the central nervous system. \nSubstance use disorders.\nParanoid personality disorder must be distinguished from\nsymptoms that may develop in association with persistent substance use. \nParanoid traits associated with physical handicaps.\nThe disorder must also be distin-\nguished from paranoid traits associated with the development of physical handicaps (e.g.,\na hearing impairment).\nOther personality disorders and personality traits.\nOther personality disorders may be\nconfused with paranoid personality disorder because they have certain features in common.\nIt is therefore important to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in their\ncharacteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features that meet criteria\nfor one or more personality disorders in addition to paranoid personality disorder, all can be\ndiagnosed. Paranoid personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder share the\ntraits of suspiciousness, interpersonal aloofness, and paranoid ideation, but schizotypal per-\nsonality disorder also includes symptoms such as magical thinking, unusual perceptual ex-\nperiences, and odd thinking and speech. Individuals with behaviors that meet criteria for\nschizoid personality disorder are often perceived as strange, eccentric, cold, and aloof, but\nthey do not usually have prominent paranoid ideation. The tendency of individuals with\nparanoid personality disorder to react to minor stimuli with anger is also seen in borderline\nand histrionic personality disorders. However, these disorders are not necessarily associ-\nated with pervasive suspiciousness. People with avoidant personality disorder may also be\nreluctant to confide in others, but more from fear of being embarrassed or found inadequate\nthan from fear of others’ malicious intent. Although antisocial behavior may be present in\nsome individuals with paranoid personality disorder, it is not usually motivated by a desire\nfor personal gain or to exploit others as in antisocial personality disorder, but rather is more\noften attributable to a desire for revenge. Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder\nmay occasionally display suspiciousness, social withdrawal, or alienation, but this derives\nprimarily from fears of having their imperfections or flaws revealed. \nParanoid traits may be adaptive, particularly in threatening environments. Paranoid\npersonality disorder should be diagnosed only when these traits are inflexible, maladap-\ntive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment or subjective distress."}

This pattern begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts.\nIndividuals with schizoid personality disorder appear to lack a desire for intimacy,\nseem indifferent to opportunities to develop close relationships, and do not seem to derive\nmuch satisfaction from being part of a family or other social group (Criterion A1). They\nprefer spending time by themselves, rather than being with other people. They often ap-\npear to be socially isolated or “loners” and almost always choose solitary activities or hob-\nbies that do not include interaction with others (Criterion A2). They prefer mechanical or\nabstract tasks, such as computer or mathematical games. They may have very little interest\nin having sexual experiences with another person (Criterion A3) and take pleasure in few,\nif any, activities (Criterion A4). There is usually a reduced experience of pleasure from sen-\nsory, bodily, or interpersonal experiences, such as walking on a beach at sunset or having\nsex. These individuals have no close friends or confidants, except possibly a first-degree\nrelative (Criterion A5).\nIndividuals with schizoid personality disorder often seem indifferent to the approval\nor criticism of others and do not appear to be bothered by what others may think of them\n(Criterion A6). They may be oblivious to the normal subtleties of social interaction and of-\nten do not respond appropriately to social cues so that they seem socially inept or super-\nficial and self-absorbed. They usually display a “bland” exterior without visible emotional\nreactivity and rarely reciprocate gestures or facial expressions, such as smiles or nods (Cri-\nterion A7). They claim that they rarely experience strong emotions such as anger and joy.\nThey often display a constricted affect and appear cold and aloof. However, in those very\nunusual circumstances in which these individuals become at least temporarily comfort-\nable in revealing themselves, they may acknowledge having painful feelings, particularly\nrelated to social interactions.\nSchizoid personality disorder should not be diagnosed if the pattern of behavior occurs\nexclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar or depressive disorder with psy-\nchotic features, another psychotic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder, or if it is attrib-\nutable to the physiological effects of a neurological (e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy) or another\nmedical condition (Criterion B).\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with schizoid personality disorder may have particular difficulty expressing\nanger, even in response to direct provocation, which contributes to the impression that\n654\nPersonality Disorders\nthey lack emotion. Their lives sometimes seem directionless, and they may appear to\n“drift” in their goals. Such individuals often react passively to adverse circumstances and\nhave difficulty responding appropriately to important life events. Because of their lack of\nsocial skills and lack of desire for sexual experiences, individuals with this disorder have\nfew friendships, date infrequently, and often do not marry. Occupational functioning may\nbe impaired, particularly if interpersonal involvement is required, but individuals with\nthis disorder may do well when they work under conditions of social isolation. Particu-\nlarly in response to stress, individuals with this disorder may experience very brief psy-\nchotic episodes (lasting minutes to hours). In some instances, schizoid personality\ndisorder may appear as the premorbid antecedent of delusional disorder or schizophre-\nnia. Individuals with this disorder may sometimes develop major depressive disorder.\nSchizoid personality disorder most often co-occurs with schizotypal, paranoid, and avoid-\nant personality disorders.\nPrevalence\nSchizoid personality disorder is uncommon in clinical settings. A prevalence estimate for\nschizoid personality based on a probability subsample from Part II of the National Co-\nmorbidity Survey Replication suggests a prevalence of 4.9%. Data from the 2001–2002\nNational Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions suggest a prevalence of\n3.1%.\nDevelopment and Course\nSchizoid personality disorder may be first apparent in childhood and adolescence with\nsolitariness, poor peer relationships, and underachievement in school, which mark these\nchildren or adolescents as different and make them subject to teasing.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nGenetic and physiological.\nSchizoid personality disorder may have increased preva-\nlence in the relatives of individuals with schizophrenia or schizotypal personality disorder.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nIndividuals from a variety of cultural backgrounds sometimes exhibit defensive behaviors\nand interpersonal styles that may be erroneously labeled as “schizoid.” For example, those\nwho have moved from rural to metropolitan environments may react with “emotional\nfreezing” that may last for several months and manifest as solitary activities, constricted\naffect, and other deficits in communication. Immigrants from other countries are some-\ntimes mistakenly perceived as cold, hostile, or indifferent.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nSchizoid personality disorder is diagnosed slightly more often in males and may cause\nmore impairment in them.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther mental disorders with psychotic symptoms.\nSchizoid personality disorder can\nbe distinguished from delusional disorder, schizophrenia, and a bipolar or depressive dis-\norder with psychotic features because these disorders are all characterized by a period of\npersistent psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions and hallucinations).

It is, therefore, important to distinguish among these disorders based on differences\nin their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features that\nmeet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to schizoid personality dis-\norder, all can be diagnosed. Although characteristics of social isolation and restricted af-\nfectivity are common to schizoid, schizotypal, and paranoid personality disorders,\nschizoid personality disorder can be distinguished from schizotypal personality disorder\nby the lack of cognitive and perceptual distortions and from paranoid personality disorder\nby the lack of suspiciousness and paranoid ideation. The social isolation of schizoid per-\nsonality disorder can be distinguished from that of avoidant personality disorder, which is\nattributable to fear of being embarrassed or found inadequate and excessive anticipation\nof rejection. In contrast, people with schizoid personality disorder have a more pervasive\ndetachment and limited desire for social intimacy. Individuals with obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder may also show an apparent social detachment stemming from devo-\ntion to work and discomfort with emotions, but they do have an underlying capacity for\nintimacy.\nIndividuals who are “loners” may display personality traits that might be considered\nschizoid. Only when these traits are inflexible and maladaptive and cause significant func-\ntional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute schizoid personality disorder."}

This pattern begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts.\nIndividuals with schizotypal personality disorder often have ideas of reference (i.e., in-\ncorrect interpretations of casual incidents and external events as having a particular and\nunusual meaning specifically for the person) (Criterion A1). These should be distin-\nguished from delusions of reference, in which the beliefs are held with delusional convic-\ntion. These individuals may be superstitious or preoccupied with paranormal phenomena\nthat are outside the norms of their subculture (Criterion A2). They may feel that they have\nspecial powers to sense events before they happen or to read others’ thoughts. They may\nbelieve that they have magical control over others, which can be implemented directly\n(e.g., believing that their spouse’s taking the dog out for a walk is the direct result of think-\ning an hour earlier it should be done) or indirectly through compliance with magical rit-\nuals (e.g., walking past a specific object three times to avoid a certain harmful outcome).\nPerceptual alterations may be present (e.g., sensing that another person is present or hear-\ning a voice murmuring his or her name) (Criterion A3). Their speech may include unusual\nor idiosyncratic phrasing and construction. It is often loose, digressive, or vague, but with-\nout actual derailment or incoherence (Criterion A4). Responses can be either overly con-\ncrete or overly abstract, and words or concepts are sometimes applied in unusual ways\n(e.g., the individual may state that he or she was not “talkable” at work).\nIndividuals with this disorder are often suspicious and may have paranoid ideation\n(e.g., believing their colleagues at work are intent on undermining their reputation with\nthe boss) (Criterion A5). They are usually not able to negotiate the full range of affects and\ninterpersonal cuing required for successful relationships and thus often appear to interact\nwith others in an inappropriate, stiff, or constricted fashion (Criterion A6). These individ-\nuals are often considered to be odd or eccentric because of unusual mannerisms, an often\nunkempt manner of dress that does not quite “fit together,” and inattention to the usual\nsocial conventions (e.g., the individual may avoid eye contact, wear clothes that are ink\nstained and ill-fitting, and be unable to join in the give-and-take banter of co-workers)\n(Criterion A7).\nIndividuals with schizotypal personality disorder experience interpersonal related-\nness as problematic and are uncomfortable relating to other people. Although they may\nexpress unhappiness about their lack of relationships, their behavior suggests a decreased\ndesire for intimate contacts. As a result, they usually have no or few close friends or con-\nfidants other than a first-degree relative (Criterion A8). They are anxious in social situa-\ntions, particularly those involving unfamiliar people (Criterion A9). They will interact\nwith other individuals when they have to but prefer to keep to themselves because they\nfeel that they are different and just do not “fit in.” Their social anxiety does not easily abate,\nSchizotypal Personality Disorder\n657\neven when they spend more time in the setting or become more familiar with the other\npeople, because their anxiety tends to be associated with suspiciousness regarding others’\nmotivations. For example, when attending a dinner party, the individual with schizotypal\npersonality disorder will not become more relaxed as time goes on, but rather may become\nincreasingly tense and suspicious.\nSchizotypal personality disorder should not be diagnosed if the pattern of behavior oc-\ncurs exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar or depressive disorder with\npsychotic features, another psychotic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder (Criterion B).\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with schizotypal personality disorder often seek treatment for the associated\nsymptoms of anxiety or depression rather than for the personality disorder features per se.\nParticularly in response to stress, individuals with this disorder may experience transient\npsychotic episodes (lasting minutes to hours), although they usually are insufficient in du-\nration to warrant an additional diagnosis such as brief psychotic disorder or schizophreni-\nform disorder. In some cases, clinically significant psychotic symptoms may develop that\nmeet criteria for brief psychotic disorder, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder,\nor schizophrenia. Over half may have a history of at least one major depressive episode.\nFrom 30% to 50% of individuals diagnosed with this disorder have a concurrent diagnosis\nof major depressive disorder when admitted to a clinical setting. There is considerable co-\noccurrence with schizoid, paranoid, avoidant, and borderline personality disorders.\nPrevalence\nIn community studies of schizotypal personality disorder, reported rates range from 0.6%\nin Norwegian samples to 4.6% in a U.S. community sample. The prevalence of schizotypal\npersonality disorder in clinical populations seems to be infrequent (0%–1.9%), with a\nhigher estimated prevalence in the general population (3.9%) found in the National Epi-\ndemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions.\nDevelopment and Course\nSchizotypal personality disorder has a relatively stable course, with only a small propor-\ntion of individuals going on to develop schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder.\nSchizotypal personality disorder may be first apparent in childhood and adolescence with\nsolitariness, poor peer relationships, social anxiety, underachievement in school, hyper-\nsensitivity, peculiar thoughts and language, and bizarre fantasies. These children may ap-\npear “odd” or “eccentric” and attract teasing. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nGenetic and physiological.\nSchizotypal personality disorder appears to aggregate fa-\nmilially and is more prevalent among the first-degree biological relatives of individuals\nwith schizophrenia than among the general population. There may also be a modest in-\ncrease in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders in the relatives of probands with\nschizotypal personality disorder.\nCultural-Related Diagnostic Issues\nCognitive and perceptual distortions must be evaluated in the context of the individual’s\ncultural milieu. Pervasive culturally determined characteristics, particularly those regard-\ning religious beliefs and rituals, can appear to be schizotypal to the uninformed outsider\n(e.g., voodoo, speaking in tongues, life beyond death, shamanism, mind reading, sixth\nsense, evil eye, magical beliefs related to health and illness).\n658\nPersonality Disorders\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nSchizotypal personality disorder may be slightly more common in males.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther mental disorders with psychotic symptoms.\nSchizotypal personality disorder\ncan be distinguished from delusional disorder, schizophrenia, and a bipolar or depressive\ndisorder with psychotic features because these disorders are all characterized by a period\nof persistent psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions and hallucinations). To give an addi-\ntional diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder, the personality disorder must have\nbeen present before the onset of psychotic symptoms and persist when the psychotic\nsymptoms are in remission. When an individual has a persistent psychotic disorder (e.g.,\nschizophrenia) that was preceded by schizotypal personality disorder, schizotypal per-\nsonality disorder should also be recorded, followed by “premorbid” in parentheses.\nNeurodevelopmental disorders.\nThere may be great difficulty differentiating children\nwith schizotypal personality disorder from the heterogeneous group of solitary, odd chil-\ndren whose behavior is characterized by marked social isolation, eccentricity, or peculiar-\nities of language and whose diagnoses would probably include milder forms of autism\nspectrum disorder or language communication disorders. Communication disorders may\nbe differentiated by the primacy and severity of the disorder in language and by the char-\nacteristic features of impaired language found in a specialized language assessment.\nMilder forms of autism spectrum disorder are differentiated by the even greater lack of so-\ncial awareness and emotional reciprocity and stereotyped behaviors and interests.\nPersonality change due to another medical condition.\nSchizotypal personality disor-\nder must be distinguished from personality change due to another medical condition, in\nwhich the traits that emerge are attributable to the effects of another medical condition on\nthe central nervous system. \nSubstance use disorders.\nSchizotypal personality disorder must also be distinguished\nfrom symptoms that may develop in association with persistent substance use.\nOther personality disorders and personality traits.\nOther personality disorders may\nbe confused with schizotypal personality disorder because they have certain features in\ncommon. It is, therefore, important to distinguish among these disorders based on differ-\nences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features\nthat meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to schizotypal person-\nality disorder, all can be diagnosed. Although paranoid and schizoid personality disor-\nders may also be characterized by social detachment and restricted affect, schizotypal\npersonality disorder can be distinguished from these two diagnoses by the presence of\ncognitive or perceptual distortions and marked eccentricity or oddness. Close relation-\nships are limited in both schizotypal personality disorder and avoidant personality dis-\norder; however, in avoidant personality disorder an active desire for relationships is\nconstrained by a fear of rejection, whereas in schizotypal personality disorder there is\na lack of desire for relationships and persistent detachment. Individuals with narcissistic\npersonality disorder may also display suspiciousness, social withdrawal, or alienation,\nbut in narcissistic personality disorder these qualities derive primarily from fears of hav-\ning imperfections or flaws revealed. Individuals with borderline personality disorder may\nalso have transient, psychotic-like symptoms, but these are usually more closely related to\naffective shifts in response to stress (e.g., intense anger, anxiety, disappointment) and are\nusually more dissociative (e.g., derealization, depersonalization). In contrast, individuals\nwith schizotypal personality disorder are more likely to have enduring psychotic-like symp-\ntoms that may worsen under stress but are less likely to be invariably associated with pro-\nnounced affective symptoms. Although social isolation may occur in borderline personality\nAntisocial Personality Disorder\n659\ndisorder, it is usually secondary to repeated interpersonal failures due to angry outbursts\nand frequent mood shifts, rather than a result of a persistent lack of social contacts and de-\nsire for intimacy. Furthermore, individuals with schizotypal personality disorder do not\nusually demonstrate the impulsive or manipulative behaviors of the individual with bor-\nderline personality disorder. However, there is a high rate of co-occurrence between the\ntwo disorders, so that making such distinctions is not always feasible. Schizotypal features\nduring adolescence may be reflective of transient emotional turmoil, rather than an endur-\ning personality disorder.\nCluster B Personality Disorders"}
{"Subcategory":"Personality Disorders","Code":"301.7 (F60.2)","Disorder":"Antisocial Personality Disorder","Content":"Antisocial Personality Disorder\nDiagnostic Criteria\n301.7 (F60.2)\nA. A pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others, occurring since\nage 15 years, as indicated by three (or more) of the following:\n1. Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors, as indicated by\nrepeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest.\n2. Deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning others for\npersonal profit or pleasure.\n3. Impulsivity or failure to plan ahead.\n4. Irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical fights or assaults.\n5. Reckless disregard for safety of self or others.\n6. Consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain consistent\nwork behavior or honor financial obligations.\n7. Lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing having hurt,\nmistreated, or stolen from another.\nB. The individual is at least age 18 years.\nC. There is evidence of conduct disorder with onset before age 15 years.\nD. The occurrence of antisocial behavior is not exclusively during the course of schizo-\nphrenia or bipolar disorder.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of disregard\nfor, and violation of, the rights of others that begins in childhood or early adolescence and\ncontinues into adulthood. This pattern has also been referred to as psychopathy, sociopathy,\nor dyssocial personality disorder. Because deceit and manipulation are central features of an-\ntisocial personality disorder, it may be especially helpful to integrate information acquired\nfrom systematic clinical assessment with information collected from collateral sources.\nFor this diagnosis to be given, the individual must be at least age 18 years (Criterion B)\nand must have had a history of some symptoms of conduct disorder before age 15 years\n(Criterion C). Conduct disorder involves a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in\nwhich the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are vio-\nlated. The specific behaviors characteristic of conduct disorder fall into one of four cate-\ngories: aggression to people and animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, or\nserious violation of rules. \n660\nPersonality Disorders\nThe pattern of antisocial behavior continues into adulthood. Individuals with antiso-\ncial personality disorder fail to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behavior\n(Criterion A1). They may repeatedly perform acts that are grounds for arrest (whether\nthey are arrested or not), such as destroying property, harassing others, stealing, or pur-\nsuing illegal occupations. Persons with this disorder disregard the wishes, rights, or feel-\nings of others. They are frequently deceitful and manipulative in order to gain personal\nprofit or pleasure (e.g., to obtain money, sex, or power) (Criterion A2). They may repeat-\nedly lie, use an alias, con others, or malinger. A pattern of impulsivity may be manifested\nby a failure to plan ahead (Criterion A3). Decisions are made on the spur of the moment,\nwithout forethought and without consideration for the consequences to self or others; this\nmay lead to sudden changes of jobs, residences, or relationships. Individuals with antiso-\ncial personality disorder tend to be irritable and aggressive and may repeatedly get into\nphysical fights or commit acts of physical assault (including spouse beating or child beat-\ning) (Criterion A4). (Aggressive acts that are required to defend oneself or someone else\nare not considered to be evidence for this item.) These individuals also display a reckless\ndisregard for the safety of themselves or others (Criterion A5). This may be evidenced in\ntheir driving behavior (i.e., recurrent speeding, driving while intoxicated, multiple acci-\ndents). They may engage in sexual behavior or substance use that has a high risk for harm-\nful consequences. They may neglect or fail to care for a child in a way that puts the child in\ndanger.\nIndividuals with antisocial personality disorder also tend to be consistently and ex-\ntremely irresponsible (Criterion A6). Irresponsible work behavior may be indicated by sig-\nnificant periods of unemployment despite available job opportunities, or by abandonment\nof several jobs without a realistic plan for getting another job. There may also be a pattern\nof repeated absences from work that are not explained by illness either in themselves or in\ntheir family. Financial irresponsibility is indicated by acts such as defaulting on debts, fail-\ning to provide child support, or failing to support other dependents on a regular basis. In-\ndividuals with antisocial personality disorder show little remorse for the consequences of\ntheir acts (Criterion A7). They may be indifferent to, or provide a superficial rationaliza-\ntion for, having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from someone (e.g., “life’s unfair,” “losers de-\nserve to lose”). These individuals may blame the victims for being foolish, helpless, or\ndeserving their fate (e.g., “he had it coming anyway”); they may minimize the harmful\nconsequences of their actions; or they may simply indicate complete indifference. They\ngenerally fail to compensate or make amends for their behavior. They may believe that\neveryone is out to “help number one” and that one should stop at nothing to avoid being\npushed around.\nThe antisocial behavior must not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia\nor bipolar disorder (Criterion D).\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with antisocial personality disorder frequently lack empathy and tend to be\ncallous, cynical, and contemptuous of the feelings, rights, and sufferings of others. They\nmay have an inflated and arrogant self-appraisal (e.g., feel that ordinary work is beneath\nthem or lack a realistic concern about their current problems or their future) and may be\nexcessively opinionated, self-assured, or cocky. They may display a glib, superficial charm\nand can be quite voluble and verbally facile (e.g., using technical terms or jargon that\nmight impress someone who is unfamiliar with the topic). Lack of empathy, inflated self-\nappraisal, and superficial charm are features that have been commonly included in tradi-\ntional conceptions of psychopathy that may be particularly distinguishing of the disorder\nand more predictive of recidivism in prison or forensic settings, where criminal, delin-\nquent, or aggressive acts are likely to be nonspecific. These individuals may also be irre-\nsponsible and exploitative in their sexual relationships. They may have a history of many\nAntisocial Personality Disorder\n661\nsexual partners and may never have sustained a monogamous relationship. They may be\nirresponsible as parents, as evidenced by malnutrition of a child, an illness in the child re-\nsulting from a lack of minimal hygiene, a child’s dependence on neighbors or nonresident\nrelatives for food or shelter, a failure to arrange for a caretaker for a young child when the\nindividual is away from home, or repeated squandering of money required for household\nnecessities. These individuals may receive dishonorable discharges from the armed ser-\nvices, may fail to be self-supporting, may become impoverished or even homeless, or may\nspend many years in penal institutions. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder\nare more likely than people in the general population to die prematurely by violent means\n(e.g., suicide, accidents, homicides).\nIndividuals with antisocial personality disorder may also experience dysphoria, in-\ncluding complaints of tension, inability to tolerate boredom, and depressed mood. They\nmay have associated anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, substance use disorders, so-\nmatic symptom disorder, gambling disorder, and other disorders of impulse control. In-\ndividuals with antisocial personality disorder also often have personality features that\nmeet criteria for other personality disorders, particularly borderline, histrionic, and nar-\ncissistic personality disorders. The likelihood of developing antisocial personality disor-\nder in adult life is increased if the individual experienced childhood onset of conduct\ndisorder (before age 10 years) and accompanying attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder.\nChild abuse or neglect, unstable or erratic parenting, or inconsistent parental discipline\nmay increase the likelihood that conduct disorder will evolve into antisocial personality\ndisorder.\nPrevalence\nTwelve-month prevalence rates of antisocial personality disorder, using criteria from pre-\nvious DSMs, are between 0.2% and 3.3%. The highest prevalence of antisocial personality\ndisorder (greater than 70%) is among most severe samples of males with alcohol use dis-\norder and from substance abuse clinics, prisons, or other forensic settings. Prevalence is\nhigher in samples affected by adverse socioeconomic (i.e., poverty) or sociocultural (i.e.,\nmigration) factors.\nDevelopment and Course\nAntisocial personality disorder has a chronic course but may become less evident or remit\nas the individual grows older, particularly by the fourth decade of life. Although this re-\nmission tends to be particularly evident with respect to engaging in criminal behavior,\nthere is likely to be a decrease in the full spectrum of antisocial behaviors and substance\nuse. By definition, antisocial personality cannot be diagnosed before age 18 years.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nGenetic and physiological.\nAntisocial personality disorder is more common among the\nfirst-degree biological relatives of those with the disorder than in the general population.\nThe risk to biological relatives of females with the disorder tends to be higher than the risk\nto biological relatives of males with the disorder. Biological relatives of individuals with\nthis disorder are also at increased risk for somatic symptom disorder and substance use\ndisorders. Within a family that has a member with antisocial personality disorder, males\nmore often have antisocial personality disorder and substance use disorders, whereas fe-\nmales more often have somatic symptom disorder. However, in such families, there is an\nincrease in prevalence of all of these disorders in both males and females compared with\nthe general population. Adoption studies indicate that both genetic and environmental\nfactors contribute to the risk of developing antisocial personality disorder. Both adopted\nand biological children of parents with antisocial personality disorder have an increased\n662\nPersonality Disorders\nrisk of developing antisocial personality disorder, somatic symptom disorder, and sub-\nstance use disorders. Adopted-away children resemble their biological parents more than\ntheir adoptive parents, but the adoptive family environment influences the risk of devel-\noping a personality disorder and related psychopathology.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nAntisocial personality disorder appears to be associated with low socioeconomic status\nand urban settings. Concerns have been raised that the diagnosis may at times be misap-\nplied to individuals in settings in which seemingly antisocial behavior may be part of a\nprotective survival strategy. In assessing antisocial traits, it is helpful for the clinician to\nconsider the social and economic context in which the behaviors occur.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nAntisocial personality disorder is much more common in males than in females. There has\nbeen some concern that antisocial personality disorder may be underdiagnosed in fe-\nmales, particularly because of the emphasis on aggressive items in the definition of con-\nduct disorder.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nThe diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder is not given to individuals younger than\n18 years and is given only if there is a history of some symptoms of conduct disorder be-\nfore age 15 years. For individuals older than 18 years, a diagnosis of conduct disorder is\ngiven only if the criteria for antisocial personality disorder are not met.\nSubstance use disorders.\nWhen antisocial behavior in an adult is associated with a\nsubstance use disorder, the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder is not made unless\nthe signs of antisocial personality disorder were also present in childhood and have con-\ntinued into adulthood. When substance use and antisocial behavior both began in childhood\nand continued into adulthood, both a substance use disorder and antisocial personality\ndisorder should be diagnosed if the criteria for both are met, even though some antisocial\nacts may be a consequence of the substance use disorder (e.g., illegal selling of drugs, thefts\nto obtain money for drugs).\nSchizophrenia and bipolar disorders.\nAntisocial behavior that occurs exclusively dur-\ning the course of schizophrenia or a bipolar disorder should not be diagnosed as antisocial\npersonality disorder. \nOther personality disorders.\nOther personality disorders may be confused with antiso-\ncial personality disorder because they have certain features in common. It is therefore im-\nportant to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in their characteristic\nfeatures. However, if an individual has personality features that meet criteria for one or\nmore personality disorders in addition to antisocial personality disorder, all can be diag-\nnosed. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder and narcissistic personality disor-\nder share a tendency to be tough-minded, glib, superficial, exploitative, and lack empathy.\nHowever, narcissistic personality disorder does not include characteristics of impulsivity,\naggression, and deceit. In addition, individuals with antisocial personality disorder may\nnot be as needy of the admiration and envy of others, and persons with narcissistic per-\nsonality disorder usually lack the history of conduct disorder in childhood or criminal\nbehavior in adulthood. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder and histrionic\npersonality disorder share a tendency to be impulsive, superficial, excitement seeking,\nreckless, seductive, and manipulative, but persons with histrionic personality disorder\ntend to be more exaggerated in their emotions and do not characteristically engage in an-\ntisocial behaviors. Individuals with histrionic and borderline personality disorders are\nBorderline Personality Disorder\n663\nmanipulative to gain nurturance, whereas those with antisocial personality disorder are\nmanipulative to gain profit, power, or some other material gratification. Individuals with\nantisocial personality disorder tend to be less emotionally unstable and more aggressive\nthan those with borderline personality disorder. Although antisocial behavior may be\npresent in some individuals with paranoid personality disorder, it is not usually moti-\nvated by a desire for personal gain or to exploit others as in antisocial personality disorder,\nbut rather is more often attributable to a desire for revenge.\nCriminal behavior not associated with a personality disorder.\nAntisocial personality\ndisorder must be distinguished from criminal behavior undertaken for gain that is not ac-\ncompanied by the personality features characteristic of this disorder. Only when antisocial\npersonality traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persistent and cause significant func-\ntional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute antisocial personality disorder."}

Chronic feelings of emptiness.\n8. Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of\ntemper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights).\n9. Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of borderline personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of instability\nof interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity that begins\nby early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts.\nIndividuals with borderline personality disorder make frantic efforts to avoid real or\nimagined abandonment (Criterion 1). The perception of impending separation or rejection,\nor the loss of external structure, can lead to profound changes in self-image, affect, cognition,\nand behavior. These individuals are very sensitive to environmental circumstances. They ex-\nperience intense abandonment fears and inappropriate anger even when faced with a real-\nistic time-limited separation or when there are unavoidable changes in plans (e.g., sudden\ndespair in reaction to a clinician’s announcing the end of the hour; panic or fury when some-\none important to them is just a few minutes late or must cancel an appointment). They may\nbelieve that this “abandonment” implies they are “bad.” These abandonment fears are re-\nlated to an intolerance of being alone and a need to have other people with them. Their frantic\n664\nPersonality Disorders\nefforts to avoid abandonment may include impulsive actions such as self-mutilating or sui-\ncidal behaviors, which are described separately in Criterion 5.\nIndividuals with borderline personality disorder have a pattern of unstable and intense\nrelationships (Criterion 2). They may idealize potential caregivers or lovers at the first or\nsecond meeting, demand to spend a lot of time together, and share the most intimate details\nearly in a relationship. However, they may switch quickly from idealizing other people to\ndevaluing them, feeling that the other person does not care enough, does not give enough,\nor is not “there” enough. These individuals can empathize with and nurture other people,\nbut only with the expectation that the other person will “be there” in return to meet their\nown needs on demand. These individuals are prone to sudden and dramatic shifts in their\nview of others, who may alternatively be seen as beneficent supports or as cruelly punitive.\nSuch shifts often reflect disillusionment with a caregiver whose nurturing qualities had\nbeen idealized or whose rejection or abandonment is expected.\nThere may be an identity disturbance characterized by markedly and persistently un-\nstable self-image or sense of self (Criterion 3). There are sudden and dramatic shifts in self-\nimage, characterized by shifting goals, values, and vocational aspirations. There may be\nsudden changes in opinions and plans about career, sexual identity, values, and types of\nfriends. These individuals may suddenly change from the role of a needy supplicant for\nhelp to that of a righteous avenger of past mistreatment. Although they usually have a self-\nimage that is based on being bad or evil, individuals with this disorder may at times have\nfeelings that they do not exist at all. Such experiences usually occur in situations in which\nthe individual feels a lack of a meaningful relationship, nurturing, and support. These in-\ndividuals may show worse performance in unstructured work or school situations.\nIndividuals with borderline personality disorder display impulsivity in at least two areas\nthat are potentially self-damaging (Criterion 4). They may gamble, spend money irrespon-\nsibly, binge eat, abuse substances, engage in unsafe sex, or drive recklessly. Individuals\nwith this disorder display recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilat-\ning behavior (Criterion 5). Completed suicide occurs in 8%–10% of such individuals, and\nself-mutilative acts (e.g., cutting or burning) and suicide threats and attempts are very\ncommon. Recurrent suicidality is often the reason that these individuals present for help.\nThese self-destructive acts are usually precipitated by threats of separation or rejection or\nby expectations that the individual assumes increased responsibility. Self-mutilation may\noccur during dissociative experiences and often brings relief by reaffirming the ability to\nfeel or by expiating the individual’s sense of being evil.\nIndividuals with borderline personality disorder may display affective instability that\nis due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anx-\niety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days) (Criterion 6). The\nbasic dysphoric mood of those with borderline personality disorder is often disrupted by\nperiods of anger, panic, or despair and is rarely relieved by periods of well-being or satis-\nfaction. These episodes may reflect the individual’s extreme reactivity to interpersonal\nstresses. Individuals with borderline personality disorder may be troubled by chronic feel-\nings of emptiness (Criterion 7). Easily bored, they may constantly seek something to do.\nIndividuals with this disorder frequently express inappropriate, intense anger or have dif-\nficulty controlling their anger (Criterion 8). They may display extreme sarcasm, enduring\nbitterness, or verbal outbursts. The anger is often elicited when a caregiver or lover is seen\nas neglectful, withholding, uncaring, or abandoning. Such expressions of anger are often\nfollowed by shame and guilt and contribute to the feeling they have of being evil. During\nperiods of extreme stress, transient paranoid ideation or dissociative symptoms (e.g., de-\npersonalization) may occur (Criterion 9), but these are generally of insufficient severity or\nduration to warrant an additional diagnosis. These episodes occur most frequently in re-\nsponse to a real or imagined abandonment. Symptoms tend to be transient, lasting min-\nutes or hours. The real or perceived return of the caregiver’s nurturance may result in a\nremission of symptoms.\nBorderline Personality Disorder\n665\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with borderline personality disorder may have a pattern of undermining\nthemselves at the moment a goal is about to be realized (e.g., dropping out of school just\nbefore graduation; regressing severely after a discussion of how well therapy is going; de-\nstroying a good relationship just when it is clear that the relationship could last). Some in-\ndividuals develop psychotic-like symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, body-image distortions,\nideas of reference, hypnagogic phenomena) during times of stress. Individuals with this\ndisorder may feel more secure with transitional objects (i.e., a pet or inanimate possession)\nthan in interpersonal relationships. Premature death from suicide may occur in individu-\nals with this disorder, especially in those with co-occurring depressive disorders or sub-\nstance use disorders. Physical handicaps may result from self-inflicted abuse behaviors or\nfailed suicide attempts. Recurrent job losses, interrupted education, and separation or di-\nvorce are common. Physical and sexual abuse, neglect, hostile conflict, and early parental\nloss are more common in the childhood histories of those with borderline personality dis-\norder. Common co-occurring disorders include depressive and bipolar disorders, sub-\nstance use disorders, eating disorders (notably bulimia nervosa), posttraumatic stress\ndisorder, and attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder. Borderline personality disorder\nalso frequently co-occurs with the other personality disorders.\nPrevalence\nThe median population prevalence of borderline personality disorder is estimated to be\n1.6% but may be as high as 5.9%. The prevalence of borderline personality disorder is\nabout 6% in primary care settings, about 10% among individuals seen in outpatient mental\nhealth clinics, and about 20% among psychiatric inpatients. The prevalence of borderline\npersonality disorder may decrease in older age groups. \nDevelopment and Course\nThere is considerable variability in the course of borderline personality disorder. The most\ncommon pattern is one of chronic instability in early adulthood, with episodes of serious\naffective and impulsive dyscontrol and high levels of use of health and mental health re-\nsources. The impairment from the disorder and the risk of suicide are greatest in the\nyoung-adult years and gradually wane with advancing age. Although the tendency to-\nward intense emotions, impulsivity, and intensity in relationships is often lifelong, indi-\nviduals who engage in therapeutic intervention often show improvement beginning\nsometime during the first year. During their 30s and 40s, the majority of individuals with\nthis disorder attain greater stability in their relationships and vocational functioning. Fol-\nlow-up studies of individuals identified through outpatient mental health clinics indicate\nthat after about 10 years, as many as half of the individuals no longer have a pattern of be-\nhavior that meets full criteria for borderline personality disorder.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nGenetic and physiological.\nBorderline personality disorder is about five times more\ncommon among first-degree biological relatives of those with the disorder than in the gen-\neral population. There is also an increased familial risk for substance use disorders, anti-\nsocial personality disorder, and depressive or bipolar disorders.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nThe pattern of behavior seen in borderline personality disorder has been identified in many\nsettings around the world. Adolescents and young adults with identity problems (especially\nwhen accompanied by substance use) may transiently display behaviors that misleadingly\n666\nPersonality Disorders\ngive the impression of borderline personality disorder. Such situations are characterized by\nemotional instability, “existential” dilemmas, uncertainty, anxiety-provoking choices, con-\nflicts about sexual orientation, and competing social pressures to decide on careers. \nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nBorderline personality disorder is diagnosed predominantly (about 75%) in females.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nDepressive and bipolar disorders.\nBorderline personality disorder often co-occurs with\ndepressive or bipolar disorders, and when criteria for both are met, both may be diagnosed.\nBecause the cross-sectional presentation of borderline personality disorder can be mimicked\nby an episode of depressive or bipolar disorder, the clinician should avoid giving an addi-\ntional diagnosis of borderline personality disorder based only on cross-sectional presenta-\ntion without having documented that the pattern of behavior had an early onset and a long-\nstanding course.\nOther personality disorders.\nOther personality disorders may be confused with border-\nline personality disorder because they have certain features in common. It is therefore im-\nportant to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in their characteristic\nfeatures. However, if an individual has personality features that meet criteria for one or\nmore personality disorders in addition to borderline personality disorder, all can be diag-\nnosed. Although histrionic personality disorder can also be characterized by attention seek-\ning, manipulative behavior, and rapidly shifting emotions, borderline personality disorder\nis distinguished by self-destructiveness, angry disruptions in close relationships, and\nchronic feelings of deep emptiness and loneliness. Paranoid ideas or illusions may be pres-\nent in both borderline personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder, but these\nsymptoms are more transient, interpersonally reactive, and responsive to external structur-\ning in borderline personality disorder. Although paranoid personality disorder and narcis-\nsistic personality disorder may also be characterized by an angry reaction to minor stimuli,\nthe relative stability of self-image, as well as the relative lack of self-destructiveness, impul-\nsivity, and abandonment concerns, distinguishes these disorders from borderline person-\nality disorder.

Is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances).\n8. Considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of histrionic personality disorder is pervasive and excessive emotion-\nality and attention-seeking behavior. This pattern begins by early adulthood and is pres-\nent in a variety of contexts.\nIndividuals with histrionic personality disorder are uncomfortable or feel unappreci-\nated when they are not the center of attention (Criterion 1). Often lively and dramatic, they\ntend to draw attention to themselves and may initially charm new acquaintances by their\nenthusiasm, apparent openness, or flirtatiousness. These qualities wear thin, however, as\nthese individuals continually demand to be the center of attention. They commandeer the\nrole of “the life of the party.” If they are not the center of attention, they may do something\ndramatic (e.g., make up stories, create a scene) to draw the focus of attention to themselves.\nThis need is often apparent in their behavior with a clinician (e.g., being flattering, bring-\ning gifts, providing dramatic descriptions of physical and psychological symptoms that\nare replaced by new symptoms each visit).\nThe appearance and behavior of individuals with this disorder are often inappropri-\nately sexually provocative or seductive (Criterion 2). This behavior not only is directed to-\nward persons in whom the individual has a sexual or romantic interest but also occurs in\na wide variety of social, occupational, and professional relationships beyond what is ap-\npropriate for the social context. Emotional expression may be shallow and rapidly shifting\n(Criterion 3). Individuals with this disorder consistently use physical appearance to draw\nattention to themselves (Criterion 4). They are overly concerned with impressing others by\ntheir appearance and expend an excessive amount of time, energy, and money on clothes\nand grooming. They may “fish for compliments” regarding appearance and may be easily\nand excessively upset by a critical comment about how they look or by a photograph that\nthey regard as unflattering.\nThese individuals have a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking\nin detail (Criterion 5). Strong opinions are expressed with dramatic flair, but underlying\nreasons are usually vague and diffuse, without supporting facts and details. For example,\nan individual with histrionic personality disorder may comment that a certain individual\nis a wonderful human being, yet be unable to provide any specific examples of good qual-\nities to support this opinion. Individuals with this disorder are characterized by self-\ndramatization, theatricality, and an exaggerated expression of emotion (Criterion 6). They\nmay embarrass friends and acquaintances by an excessive public display of emotions (e.g.,\nembracing casual acquaintances with excessive ardor, sobbing uncontrollably on minor\n668\nPersonality Disorders\nsentimental occasions, having temper tantrums). However, their emotions often seem to\nbe turned on and off too quickly to be deeply felt, which may lead others to accuse the in-\ndividual of faking these feelings.\nIndividuals with histrionic personality disorder have a high degree of suggestibility (Cri-\nterion 7). Their opinions and feelings are easily influenced by others and by current fads.\nThey may be overly trusting, especially of strong authority figures whom they see as mag-\nically solving their problems. They have a tendency to play hunches and to adopt convic-\ntions quickly. Individuals with this disorder often consider relationships more intimate\nthan they actually are, describing almost every acquaintance as “my dear, dear friend” or\nreferring to physicians met only once or twice under professional circumstances by their\nfirst names (Criterion 8). \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with histrionic personality disorder may have difficulty achieving emotional in-\ntimacy in romantic or sexual relationships. Without being aware of it, they often act out a\nrole (e.g., “victim” or “princess”) in their relationships to others. They may seek to control\ntheir partner through emotional manipulation or seductiveness on one level, while display-\ning a marked dependency on them at another level. Individuals with this disorder often\nhave impaired relationships with same-sex friends because their sexually provocative inter-\npersonal style may seem a threat to their friends’ relationships. These individuals may also\nalienate friends with demands for constant attention. They often become depressed and up-\nset when they are not the center of attention. They may crave novelty, stimulation, and ex-\ncitement and have a tendency to become bored with their usual routine. These individuals\nare often intolerant of, or frustrated by, situations that involve delayed gratification, and\ntheir actions are often directed at obtaining immediate satisfaction. Although they often ini-\ntiate a job or project with great enthusiasm, their interest may lag quickly. Longer-term re-\nlationships may be neglected to make way for the excitement of new relationships.\nThe actual risk of suicide is not known, but clinical experience suggests that individu-\nals with this disorder are at increased risk for suicidal gestures and threats to get attention\nand coerce better caregiving. Histrionic personality disorder has been associated with\nhigher rates of somatic symptom disorder, conversion disorder (functional neurological\nsymptom disorder), and major depressive disorder. Borderline, narcissistic, antisocial, and\ndependent personality disorders often co-occur.\nPrevalence\nData from the 2001–2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Condi-\ntions suggest a prevalence of histrionic personality of 1.84%.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nNorms for interpersonal behavior, personal appearance, and emotional expressiveness\nvary widely across cultures, genders, and age groups. Before considering the various traits\n(e.g., emotionality, seductiveness, dramatic interpersonal style, novelty seeking, sociabil-\nity, charm, impressionability, a tendency to somatization) to be evidence of histrionic per-\nsonality disorder, it is important to evaluate whether they cause clinically significant\nimpairment or distress. \nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nIn clinical settings, this disorder has been diagnosed more frequently in females; however,\nthe sex ratio is not significantly different from the sex ratio of females within the respective\nclinical setting. In contrast, some studies using structured assessments report similar prev-\nalence rates among males and females.\nNarcissistic Personality Disorder\n669\nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther personality disorders and personality traits.\nOther personality disorders may\nbe confused with histrionic personality disorder because they have certain features in\ncommon. It is therefore important to distinguish among these disorders based on differ-\nences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features\nthat meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to histrionic personal-\nity disorder, all can be diagnosed. Although borderline personality disorder can also be\ncharacterized by attention seeking, manipulative behavior, and rapidly shifting emotions,\nit is distinguished by self-destructiveness, angry disruptions in close relationships, and\nchronic feelings of deep emptiness and identity disturbance. Individuals with antisocial\npersonality disorder and histrionic personality disorder share a tendency to be impulsive,\nsuperficial, excitement seeking, reckless, seductive, and manipulative, but persons with\nhistrionic personality disorder tend to be more exaggerated in their emotions and do not\ncharacteristically engage in antisocial behaviors. Individuals with histrionic personality\ndisorder are manipulative to gain nurturance, whereas those with antisocial personality\ndisorder are manipulative to gain profit, power, or some other material gratification. Al-\nthough individuals with narcissistic personality disorder also crave attention from others,\nthey usually want praise for their “superiority,” whereas individuals with histrionic per-\nsonality disorder are willing to be viewed as fragile or dependent if this is instrumental in\ngetting attention. Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder may exaggerate the\nintimacy of their relationships with other people, but they are more apt to emphasize the\n“VIP” status or wealth of their friends. In dependent personality disorder, the individual\nis excessively dependent on others for praise and guidance, but is without the flamboyant,\nexaggerated, emotional features of individuals with histrionic personality disorder.\nMany individuals may display histrionic personality traits. Only when these traits are\ninflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment or\nsubjective distress do they constitute histrionic personality disorder.\nPersonality change due to another medical condition.\nHistrionic personality disorder\nmust be distinguished from personality change due to another medical condition, in\nwhich the traits that emerge are attributable to the effects of another medical condition on\nthe central nervous system. \nSubstance use disorders.\nThe disorder must also be distinguished from symptoms that\nmay develop in association with persistent substance use."}

Shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of narcissistic personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of grandi-\nosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy that begins by early adulthood and is pres-\nent in a variety of contexts.\nIndividuals with this disorder have a grandiose sense of self-importance (Criterion 1).\nThey routinely overestimate their abilities and inflate their accomplishments, often appearing\nboastful and pretentious. They may blithely assume that others attribute the same value to\ntheir efforts and may be surprised when the praise they expect and feel they deserve is not\nforthcoming. Often implicit in the inflated judgments of their own accomplishments is an un-\nderestimation (devaluation) of the contributions of others. Individuals with narcissistic per-\nsonality disorder are often preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance,\nbeauty, or ideal love (Criterion 2). They may ruminate about “long overdue” admiration and\nprivilege and compare themselves favorably with famous or privileged people.\nIndividuals with narcissistic personality disorder believe that they are superior, spe-\ncial, or unique and expect others to recognize them as such (Criterion 3). They may feel\nthat they can only be understood by, and should only associate with, other people who are\nspecial or of high status and may attribute “unique,” “perfect,” or “gifted” qualities to those\nwith whom they associate. Individuals with this disorder believe that their needs are spe-\ncial and beyond the ken of ordinary people. Their own self-esteem is enhanced (i.e., “mir-\nrored”) by the idealized value that they assign to those with whom they associate. They are\nlikely to insist on having only the “top” person (doctor, lawyer, hairdresser, instructor) or\nbeing affiliated with the “best” institutions but may devalue the credentials of those who dis-\nappoint them.\nIndividuals with this disorder generally require excessive admiration (Criterion 4). Their\nself-esteem is almost invariably very fragile. They may be preoccupied with how well they\nare doing and how favorably they are regarded by others. This often takes the form of a need\nfor constant attention and admiration. They may expect their arrival to be greeted with great\nfanfare and are astonished if others do not covet their possessions. They may constantly fish\nfor compliments, often with great charm. A sense of entitlement is evident in these individ-\nuals’ unreasonable expectation of especially favorable treatment (Criterion 5). They expect\nto be catered to and are puzzled or furious when this does not happen. For example, they\nmay assume that they do not have to wait in line and that their priorities are so important\nthat others should defer to them, and then get irritated when others fail to assist “in their\nvery important work.” This sense of entitlement, combined with a lack of sensitivity to the\nwants and needs of others, may result in the conscious or unwitting exploitation of others\n(Criterion 6). They expect to be given whatever they want or feel they need, no matter what\nit might mean to others. For example, these individuals may expect great dedication from\nothers and may overwork them without regard for the impact on their lives. They tend to\nform friendships or romantic relationships only if the other person seems likely to advance\ntheir purposes or otherwise enhance their self-esteem. They often usurp special privileges\nand extra resources that they believe they deserve because they are so special.\nIndividuals with narcissistic personality disorder generally have a lack of empathy and\nhave difficulty recognizing the desires, subjective experiences, and feelings of others (Crite-\nrion 7). They may assume that others are totally concerned about their welfare. They tend to\ndiscuss their own concerns in inappropriate and lengthy detail, while failing to recognize\nthat others also have feelings and needs. They are often contemptuous and impatient with\nNarcissistic Personality Disorder\n671\nothers who talk about their own problems and concerns. These individuals may be oblivious\nto the hurt their remarks may inflict (e.g., exuberantly telling a former lover that “I am now\nin the relationship of a lifetime!”; boasting of health in front of someone who is sick). When\nrecognized, the needs, desires, or feelings of others are likely to be viewed disparagingly as\nsigns of weakness or vulnerability. Those who relate to individuals with narcissistic person-\nality disorder typically find an emotional coldness and lack of reciprocal interest.\nThese individuals are often envious of others or believe that others are envious of them\n(Criterion 8). They may begrudge others their successes or possessions, feeling that they better\ndeserve those achievements, admiration, or privileges. They may harshly devalue the contri-\nbutions of others, particularly when those individuals have received acknowledgment or\npraise for their accomplishments. Arrogant, haughty behaviors characterize these individuals;\nthey often display snobbish, disdainful, or patronizing attitudes (Criterion 9). For example, an\nindividual with this disorder may complain about a clumsy waiter’s “rudeness” or “stupidity”\nor conclude a medical evaluation with a condescending evaluation of the physician.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nVulnerability in self-esteem makes individuals with narcissistic personality disorder very\nsensitive to “injury” from criticism or defeat. Although they may not show it outwardly,\ncriticism may haunt these individuals and may leave them feeling humiliated, degraded,\nhollow, and empty. They may react with disdain, rage, or defiant counterattack. Such ex-\nperiences often lead to social withdrawal or an appearance of humility that may mask and\nprotect the grandiosity. Interpersonal relations are typically impaired because of problems\nderived from entitlement, the need for admiration, and the relative disregard for the sen-\nsitivities of others. Though overweening ambition and confidence may lead to high\nachievement, performance may be disrupted because of intolerance of criticism or defeat.\nSometimes vocational functioning can be very low, reflecting an unwillingness to take a\nrisk in competitive or other situations in which defeat is possible. Sustained feelings of\nshame or humiliation and the attendant self-criticism may be associated with social with-\ndrawal, depressed mood, and persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) or major de-\npressive disorder. In contrast, sustained periods of grandiosity may be associated with a\nhypomanic mood. Narcissistic personality disorder is also associated with anorexia ner-\nvosa and substance use disorders (especially related to cocaine). Histrionic, borderline,\nantisocial, and paranoid personality disorders may be associated with narcissistic person-\nality disorder.\nPrevalence\nPrevalence estimates for narcissistic personality disorder, based on DSM-IV definitions,\nrange from 0% to 6.2% in community samples. \nDevelopment and Course\nNarcissistic traits may be particularly common in adolescents and do not necessarily in-\ndicate that the individual will go on to have narcissistic personality disorder. Individuals\nwith narcissistic personality disorder may have special difficulties adjusting to the onset of\nphysical and occupational limitations that are inherent in the aging process. \nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nOf those diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder, 50%–75% are male.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther personality disorders and personality traits.\nOther personality disorders may\nbe confused with narcissistic personality disorder because they have certain features in\n672\nPersonality Disorders\ncommon. It is, therefore, important to distinguish among these disorders based on differ-\nences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features\nthat meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to narcissistic person-\nality disorder, all can be diagnosed. The most useful feature in discriminating narcissistic\npersonality disorder from histrionic, antisocial, and borderline personality disorders, in\nwhich the interactive styles are coquettish, callous, and needy, respectively, is the grandi-\nosity characteristic of narcissistic personality disorder. The relative stability of self-image\nas well as the relative lack of self-destructiveness, impulsivity, and abandonment concerns\nalso help distinguish narcissistic personality disorder from borderline personality disor-\nder. Excessive pride in achievements, a relative lack of emotional display, and disdain for\nothers’ sensitivities help distinguish narcissistic personality disorder from histrionic\npersonality disorder. Although individuals with borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic\npersonality disorders may require much attention, those with narcissistic personality dis-\norder specifically need that attention to be admiring. Individuals with antisocial and nar-\ncissistic personality disorders share a tendency to be tough-minded, glib, superficial,\nexploitative, and unempathic. However, narcissistic personality disorder does not neces-\nsarily include characteristics of impulsivity, aggression, and deceit. In addition, individu-\nals with antisocial personality disorder may not be as needy of the admiration and envy of\nothers, and persons with narcissistic personality disorder usually lack the history of con-\nduct disorder in childhood or criminal behavior in adulthood. In both narcissistic person-\nality disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, the individual may profess\na commitment to perfectionism and believe that others cannot do things as well. In con-\ntrast to the accompanying self-criticism of those with obsessive-compulsive personality\ndisorder, individuals with narcissistic personality disorder are more likely to believe that\nthey have achieved perfection. Suspiciousness and social withdrawal usually distinguish\nthose with schizotypal or paranoid personality disorder from those with narcissistic per-\nsonality disorder. When these qualities are present in individuals with narcissistic person-\nality disorder, they derive primarily from fears of having imperfections or flaws revealed. \nMany highly successful individuals display personality traits that might be considered\nnarcissistic. Only when these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause\nsignificant functional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute narcissistic per-\nsonality disorder.\nMania or hypomania.\nGrandiosity may emerge as part of manic or hypomanic episodes,\nbut the association with mood change or functional impairments helps distinguish these\nepisodes from narcissistic personality disorder. \nSubstance use disorders.\nNarcissistic personality disorder must also be distinguished\nfrom symptoms that may develop in association with persistent substance use.\nCluster C Personality Disorders"}

Is unusually reluctant to take personal risks or to engage in any new activities because\nthey may prove embarrassing.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of avoidant personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of social inhi-\nbition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation that begins by\nearly adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts.\nIndividuals with avoidant personality disorder avoid work activities that involve sig-\nnificant interpersonal contact because of fears of criticism, disapproval, or rejection (Cri-\nterion 1). Offers of job promotions may be declined because the new responsibilities might\nresult in criticism from co-workers. These individuals avoid making new friends unless\nthey are certain they will be liked and accepted without criticism (Criterion 2). Until they\npass stringent tests proving the contrary, other people are assumed to be critical and dis-\napproving. Individuals with this disorder will not join in group activities unless there are\nrepeated and generous offers of support and nurturance. Interpersonal intimacy is often\ndifficult for these individuals, although they are able to establish intimate relationships\nwhen there is assurance of uncritical acceptance. They may act with restraint, have diffi-\nculty talking about themselves, and withhold intimate feelings for fear of being exposed,\nridiculed, or shamed (Criterion 3).\nBecause individuals with this disorder are preoccupied with being criticized or re-\njected in social situations, they may have a markedly low threshold for detecting such re-\nactions (Criterion 4). If someone is even slightly disapproving or critical, they may feel\nextremely hurt. They tend to be shy, quiet, inhibited, and “invisible” because of the fear\nthat any attention would be degrading or rejecting. They expect that no matter what they\nsay, others will see it as “wrong,” and so they may say nothing at all. They react strongly\nto subtle cues that are suggestive of mockery or derision. Despite their longing to be active\nparticipants in social life, they fear placing their welfare in the hands of others. Individuals\nwith avoidant personality disorder are inhibited in new interpersonal situations because\nthey feel inadequate and have low self-esteem (Criterion 5). Doubts concerning social\ncompetence and personal appeal become especially manifest in settings involving inter-\nactions with strangers. These individuals believe themselves to be socially inept, person-\nally unappealing, or inferior to others (Criterion 6). They are unusually reluctant to take\npersonal risks or to engage in any new activities because these may prove embarrassing\n(Criterion 7). They are prone to exaggerate the potential dangers of ordinary situations,\nand a restricted lifestyle may result from their need for certainty and security. Someone\nwith this disorder may cancel a job interview for fear of being embarrassed by not dressing\nappropriately. Marginal somatic symptoms or other problems may become the reason for\navoiding new activities.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with avoidant personality disorder often vigilantly appraise the movements\nand expressions of those with whom they come into contact. Their fearful and tense de-\nmeanor may elicit ridicule and derision from others, which in turn confirms their self-\ndoubts. These individuals are very anxious about the possibility that they will react to crit-\nicism with blushing or crying. They are described by others as being “shy,” “timid,”\n674\nPersonality Disorders\n“lonely,” and “isolated.” The major problems associated with this disorder occur in social\nand occupational functioning. The low self-esteem and hypersensitivity to rejection are\nassociated with restricted interpersonal contacts. These individuals may become relatively\nisolated and usually do not have a large social support network that can help them weather\ncrises. They desire affection and acceptance and may fantasize about idealized relation-\nships with others. The avoidant behaviors can also adversely affect occupational function-\ning because these individuals try to avoid the types of social situations that may be\nimportant for meeting the basic demands of the job or for advancement.\nOther disorders that are commonly diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder in-\nclude depressive, bipolar, and anxiety disorders, especially social anxiety disorder (social\nphobia). Avoidant personality disorder is often diagnosed with dependent personality\ndisorder, because individuals with avoidant personality disorder become very attached to\nand dependent on those few other people with whom they are friends. Avoidant per-\nsonality disorder also tends to be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and with\nthe Cluster A personality disorders (i.e., paranoid, schizoid, or schizotypal personality\ndisorders).\nPrevalence\nData from the 2001–2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Condi-\ntions suggest a prevalence of about 2.4% for avoidant personality disorder.\nDevelopment and Course\nThe avoidant behavior often starts in infancy or childhood with shyness, isolation, and\nfear of strangers and new situations. Although shyness in childhood is a common precur-\nsor of avoidant personality disorder, in most individuals it tends to gradually dissipate as\nthey get older. In contrast, individuals who go on to develop avoidant personality disor-\nder may become increasingly shy and avoidant during adolescence and early adulthood,\nwhen social relationships with new people become especially important. There is some\nevidence that in adults, avoidant personality disorder tends to become less evident or to\nremit with age. This diagnosis should be used with great caution in children and adoles-\ncents, for whom shy and avoidant behavior may be developmentally appropriate.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nThere may be variation in the degree to which different cultural and ethnic groups regard\ndiffidence and avoidance as appropriate. Moreover, avoidant behavior may be the result\nof problems in acculturation following immigration. \nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nAvoidant personality disorder appears to be equally frequent in males and females.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nAnxiety disorders.\nThere appears to be a great deal of overlap between avoidant person-\nality disorder and social anxiety disorder (social phobia), so much so that they may be\nalternative conceptualizations of the same or similar conditions. Avoidance also character-\nizes both avoidant personality disorder and agoraphobia, and they often co-occur. \nOther personality disorders and personality traits.\nOther personality disorders may\nbe confused with avoidant personality disorder because they have certain features in com-\nmon. It is, therefore, important to distinguish among these disorders based on differences\nin their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features that\nmeet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to avoidant personality dis-\nDependent Personality Disorder\n675\norder, all can be diagnosed. Both avoidant personality disorder and dependent personal-\nity disorder are characterized by feelings of inadequacy, hypersensitivity to criticism, and\na need for reassurance. Although the primary focus of concern in avoidant personality\ndisorder is avoidance of humiliation and rejection, in dependent personality disorder the\nfocus is on being taken care of. However, avoidant personality disorder and dependent\npersonality disorder are particularly likely to co-occur. Like avoidant personality disor-\nder, schizoid personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder are characterized\nby social isolation. However, individuals with avoidant personality disorder want to have\nrelationships with others and feel their loneliness deeply, whereas those with schizoid or\nschizotypal personality disorder may be content with and even prefer their social isola-\ntion. Paranoid personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder are both character-\nized by a reluctance to confide in others. However, in avoidant personality disorder, this\nreluctance is attributable more to a fear of being embarrassed or being found inadequate\nthan to a fear of others’ malicious intent.\nMany individuals display avoidant personality traits.

Urgently seeks another relationship as a source of care and support when a close re-\nlationship ends.\n8. Is unrealistically preoccupied with fears of being left to take care of himself or herself.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of dependent personality disorder is a pervasive and excessive need\nto be taken care of that leads to submissive and clinging behavior and fears of separation.\nThis pattern begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts. The dependent\n676\nPersonality Disorders\nand submissive behaviors are designed to elicit caregiving and arise from a self-perception\nof being unable to function adequately without the help of others.\nIndividuals with dependent personality disorder have great difficulty making every-\nday decisions (e.g., what color shirt to wear to work or whether to carry an umbrella) without\nan excessive amount of advice and reassurance from others (Criterion 1). These individu-\nals tend to be passive and to allow other people (often a single other person) to take the ini-\ntiative and assume responsibility for most major areas of their lives (Criterion 2). Adults\nwith this disorder typically depend on a parent or spouse to decide where they should\nlive, what kind of job they should have, and which neighbors to befriend. Adolescents\nwith this disorder may allow their parent(s) to decide what they should wear, with whom\nthey should associate, how they should spend their free time, and what school or college\nthey should attend. This need for others to assume responsibility goes beyond age-appro-\npriate and situation-appropriate requests for assistance from others (e.g., the specific\nneeds of children, elderly persons, and handicapped persons). Dependent personality dis-\norder may occur in an individual who has a serious medical condition or disability, but in\nsuch cases the difficulty in taking responsibility must go beyond what would normally be\nassociated with that condition or disability.\nBecause they fear losing support or approval, individuals with dependent personality\ndisorder often have difficulty expressing disagreement with other individuals, especially\nthose on whom they are dependent (Criterion 3). These individuals feel so unable to func-\ntion alone that they will agree with things that they feel are wrong rather than risk losing\nthe help of those to whom they look for guidance. They do not get appropriately angry at\nothers whose support and nurturance they need for fear of alienating them. If the individ-\nual’s concerns regarding the consequences of expressing disagreement are realistic (e.g.,\nrealistic fears of retribution from an abusive spouse), the behavior should not be consid-\nered to be evidence of dependent personality disorder.\nIndividuals with this disorder have difficulty initiating projects or doing things inde-\npendently (Criterion 4). They lack self-confidence and believe that they need help to begin\nand carry through tasks. They will wait for others to start things because they believe that\nas a rule others can do them better. These individuals are convinced that they are incapable\nof functioning independently and present themselves as inept and requiring constant as-\nsistance. They are, however, likely to function adequately if given the assurance that some-\none else is supervising and approving. There may be a fear of becoming or appearing to be\nmore competent, because they may believe that this will lead to abandonment. Because\nthey rely on others to handle their problems, they often do not learn the skills of indepen-\ndent living, thus perpetuating dependency.\nIndividuals with dependent personality disorder may go to excessive lengths to obtain\nnurturance and support from others, even to the point of volunteering for unpleasant\ntasks if such behavior will bring the care they need (Criterion 5). They are willing to submit\nto what others want, even if the demands are unreasonable. Their need to maintain an im-\nportant bond will often result in imbalanced or distorted relationships. They may make ex-\ntraordinary self-sacrifices or tolerate verbal, physical, or sexual abuse. (It should be noted\nthat this behavior should be considered evidence of dependent personality disorder only\nwhen it can clearly be established that other options are available to the individual.) Indi-\nviduals with this disorder feel uncomfortable or helpless when alone, because of their ex-\naggerated fears of being unable to care for themselves (Criterion 6). They will “tag along”\nwith important others just to avoid being alone, even if they are not interested or involved\nin what is happening.\nWhen a close relationship ends (e.g., a breakup with a lover; the death of a caregiver), in-\ndividuals with dependent personality disorder may urgently seek another relationship to\nprovide the care and support they need (Criterion 7). Their belief that they are unable to\nfunction in the absence of a close relationship motivates these individuals to become quickly\nand indiscriminately attached to another individual. Individuals with this disorder are often\nDependent Personality Disorder\n677\npreoccupied with fears of being left to care for themselves (Criterion 8). They see themselves\nas so totally dependent on the advice and help of an important other person that they worry\nabout being abandoned by that person when there are no grounds to justify such fears. To be\nconsidered as evidence of this criterion, the fears must be excessive and unrealistic. For ex-\nample, an elderly man with cancer who moves into his son’s household for care is exhibiting\ndependent behavior that is appropriate given this person’s life circumstances.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with dependent personality disorder are often characterized by pessimism\nand self-doubt, tend to belittle their abilities and assets, and may constantly refer to them-\nselves as “stupid.” They take criticism and disapproval as proof of their worthlessness and\nlose faith in themselves. They may seek overprotection and dominance from others. Oc-\ncupational functioning may be impaired if independent initiative is required. They may\navoid positions of responsibility and become anxious when faced with decisions. Social re-\nlations tend to be limited to those few people on whom the individual is dependent. There\nmay be an increased risk of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and adjustment dis-\norders. Dependent personality disorder often co-occurs with other personality disorders,\nespecially borderline, avoidant, and histrionic personality disorders. Chronic physical ill-\nness or separation anxiety disorder in childhood or adolescence may predispose the indi-\nvidual to the development of this disorder.\nPrevalence\nData from the 2001–2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Condi-\ntions yielded an estimated prevalence of dependent personality disorder of 0.49%, and de-\npendent personality was estimated, based on a probability subsample from Part II of the\nNational Comorbidity Survey Replication, to be 0.6%.\nDevelopment and Course\nThis diagnosis should be used with great caution, if at all, in children and adolescents, for\nwhom dependent behavior may be developmentally appropriate.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nThe degree to which dependent behaviors are considered to be appropriate varies sub-\nstantially across different age and sociocultural groups. Age and cultural factors need to\nbe considered in evaluating the diagnostic threshold of each criterion. Dependent behav-\nior should be considered characteristic of the disorder only when it is clearly in excess of\nthe individual’s cultural norms or reflects unrealistic concerns. An emphasis on passivity,\npoliteness, and deferential treatment is characteristic of some societies and may be mis-\ninterpreted as traits of dependent personality disorder. Similarly, societies may differen-\ntially foster and discourage dependent behavior in males and females. \nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nIn clinical settings, dependent personality disorder has been diagnosed more frequently in\nfemales, although some studies report similar prevalence rates among males and females. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther mental disorders and medical conditions.\nDependent personality disorder must\nbe distinguished from dependency arising as a consequence of other mental disorders (e.g.,\ndepressive disorders, panic disorder, agoraphobia) and as a result of other medical conditions. \n678\nPersonality Disorders\nOther personality disorders and personality traits.\nOther personality disorders may be\nconfused with dependent personality disorder because they have certain features in com-\nmon. It is therefore important to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in\ntheir characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features that meet cri-\nteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to dependent personality disorder, all\ncan be diagnosed. Although many personality disorders are characterized by dependent\nfeatures, dependent personality disorder can be distinguished by its predominantly submis-\nsive, reactive, and clinging behavior. Both dependent personality disorder and borderline\npersonality disorder are characterized by fear of abandonment; however, the individual\nwith borderline personality disorder reacts to abandonment with feelings of emotional emp-\ntiness, rage, and demands, whereas the individual with dependent personality disorder re-\nacts with increasing appeasement and submissiveness and urgently seeks a replacement\nrelationship to provide caregiving and support. Borderline personality disorder can further\nbe distinguished from dependent personality disorder by a typical pattern of unstable and\nintense relationships. Individuals with histrionic personality disorder, like those with de-\npendent personality disorder, have a strong need for reassurance and approval and may ap-\npear childlike and clinging. However, unlike dependent personality disorder, which is\ncharacterized by self-effacing and docile behavior, histrionic personality disorder is charac-\nterized by gregarious flamboyance with active demands for attention. Both dependent\npersonality disorder and avoidant personality disorder are characterized by feelings of in-\nadequacy, hypersensitivity to criticism, and a need for reassurance; however, individuals\nwith avoidant personality disorder have such a strong fear of humiliation and rejection that\nthey withdraw until they are certain they will be accepted. In contrast, individuals with de-\npendent personality disorder have a pattern of seeking and maintaining connections to im-\nportant others, rather than avoiding and withdrawing from relationships.\nMany individuals display dependent personality traits. Only when these traits are in-\nflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment or sub-\njective distress do they constitute dependent personality disorder. \nPersonality change due to another medical condition.\nDependent personality disor-\nder must be distinguished from personality change due to another medical condition, in\nwhich the traits that emerge are attributable to the effects of another medical condition on\nthe central nervous system.\nSubstance use disorders.\nDependent personality disorder must also be distinguished\nfrom symptoms that may develop in association with persistent substance use."}

Adopts a miserly spending style toward both self and others; money is viewed as\nsomething to be hoarded for future catastrophes.\n8. Shows rigidity and stubbornness.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is a preoccupation\nwith orderliness, perfectionism, and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of\nflexibility, openness, and efficiency. This pattern begins by early adulthood and is present\nin a variety of contexts.\nIndividuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder attempt to maintain a\nsense of control through painstaking attention to rules, trivial details, procedures, lists,\nschedules, or form to the extent that the major point of the activity is lost (Criterion 1). They\nare excessively careful and prone to repetition, paying extraordinary attention to detail\nand repeatedly checking for possible mistakes. They are oblivious to the fact that other\npeople tend to become very annoyed at the delays and inconveniences that result from this\nbehavior. For example, when such individuals misplace a list of things to be done, they\nwill spend an inordinate amount of time looking for the list rather than spending a few\nmoments re-creating it from memory and proceeding to accomplish the tasks. Time is\npoorly allocated, and the most important tasks are left to the last moment. The perfection-\nism and self-imposed high standards of performance cause significant dysfunction and\ndistress in these individuals. They may become so involved in making every detail of a\nproject absolutely perfect that the project is never finished (Criterion 2). For example, the\ncompletion of a written report is delayed by numerous time-consuming rewrites that all\ncome up short of “perfection.” Deadlines are missed, and aspects of the individual’s life\nthat are not the current focus of activity may fall into disarray.\nIndividuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder display excessive devotion\nto work and productivity to the exclusion of leisure activities and friendships (Criterion 3).\nThis behavior is not accounted for by economic necessity. They often feel that they do not\nhave time to take an evening or a weekend day off to go on an outing or to just relax. They\nmay keep postponing a pleasurable activity, such as a vacation, so that it may never occur.\nWhen they do take time for leisure activities or vacations, they are very uncomfortable un-\nless they have taken along something to work on so they do not “waste time.” There may be\na great concentration on household chores (e.g., repeated excessive cleaning so that “one\ncould eat off the floor”). If they spend time with friends, it is likely to be in some kind of for-\nmally organized activity (e.g., sports). Hobbies or recreational activities are approached as\nserious tasks requiring careful organization and hard work to master. The emphasis is on\nperfect performance. These individuals turn play into a structured task (e.g., correcting an\ninfant for not putting rings on the post in the right order; telling a toddler to ride his or her tri-\ncycle in a straight line; turning a baseball game into a harsh “lesson”).\nIndividuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder may be excessively con-\nscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about matters of morality, ethics, or values (Crite-\nrion 4). They may force themselves and others to follow rigid moral principles and very\nstrict standards of performance. They may also be mercilessly self-critical about their own\nmistakes. Individuals with this disorder are rigidly deferential to authority and rules and\ninsist on quite literal compliance, with no rule bending for extenuating circumstances. For\nexample, the individual will not lend a quarter to a friend who needs one to make a tele-\nphone call because “neither a borrower nor a lender be” or because it would be “bad” for\n680\nPersonality Disorders\nthe person’s character. These qualities should not be accounted for by the individual’s cul-\ntural or religious identification.\nIndividuals with this disorder may be unable to discard worn-out or worthless objects,\neven when they have no sentimental value (Criterion 5). Often these individuals will ad-\nmit to being “pack rats.” They regard discarding objects as wasteful because “you never\nknow when you might need something” and will become upset if someone tries to get rid of\nthe things they have saved. Their spouses or roommates may complain about the amount of\nspace taken up by old parts, magazines, broken appliances, and so on. \nIndividuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder are reluctant to delegate\ntasks or to work with others (Criterion 6). They stubbornly and unreasonably insist that\neverything be done their way and that people conform to their way of doing things. They\noften give very detailed instructions about how things should be done (e.g., there is one\nand only one way to mow the lawn, wash the dishes, build a doghouse) and are surprised\nand irritated if others suggest creative alternatives. At other times they may reject offers of\nhelp even when behind schedule because they believe no one else can do it right.\nIndividuals with this disorder may be miserly and stingy and maintain a standard of\nliving far below what they can afford, believing that spending must be tightly controlled to\nprovide for future catastrophes (Criterion 7). Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder\nis characterized by rigidity and stubbornness (Criterion 8). Individuals with this disorder\nare so concerned about having things done the one “correct” way that they have trouble\ngoing along with anyone else’s ideas. These individuals plan ahead in meticulous detail\nand are unwilling to consider changes. Totally wrapped up in their own perspective, they\nhave difficulty acknowledging the viewpoints of others. Friends and colleagues may be-\ncome frustrated by this constant rigidity. Even when individuals with obsessive-compul-\nsive personality disorder recognize that it may be in their interest to compromise, they\nmay stubbornly refuse to do so, arguing that it is “the principle of the thing.”\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nWhen rules and established procedures do not dictate the correct answer, decision making\nmay become a time-consuming, often painful process. Individuals with obsessive-\ncompulsive personality disorder may have such difficulty deciding which tasks take pri-\nority or what is the best way of doing some particular task that they may never get started\non anything. They are prone to become upset or angry in situations in which they are not\nable to maintain control of their physical or interpersonal environment, although the an-\nger is typically not expressed directly. For example, an individual may be angry when ser-\nvice in a restaurant is poor, but instead of complaining to the management, the individual\nruminates about how much to leave as a tip. On other occasions, anger may be expressed\nwith righteous indignation over a seemingly minor matter. Individuals with this disorder\nmay be especially attentive to their relative status in dominance-submission relationships\nand may display excessive deference to an authority they respect and excessive resistance\nto authority they do not respect.\nIndividuals with this disorder usually express affection in a highly controlled or stilted\nfashion and may be very uncomfortable in the presence of others who are emotionally ex-\npressive. Their everyday relationships have a formal and serious quality, and they may be\nstiff in situations in which others would smile and be happy (e.g., greeting a lover at the\nairport). They carefully hold themselves back until they are sure that whatever they say\nwill be perfect. They may be preoccupied with logic and intellect, and intolerant of affec-\ntive behavior in others. They often have difficulty expressing tender feelings, rarely pay-\ning compliments. Individuals with this disorder may experience occupational difficulties\nand distress, particularly when confronted with new situations that demand flexibility\nand compromise.\nIndividuals with anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, social anx-\niety disorder (social phobia), and specific phobias, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)\nObsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder\n681\nhave an increased likelihood of having a personality disturbance that meets criteria for ob-\nsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Even so, it appears that the majority of individ-\nuals with OCD do not have a pattern of behavior that meets criteria for this personality\ndisorder. Many of the features of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder overlap with\n“type A” personality characteristics (e.g., preoccupation with work, competitiveness, time\nurgency), and these features may be present in people at risk for myocardial infarction.\nThere may be an association between obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and de-\npressive and bipolar disorders and eating disorders.\nPrevalence\nObsessive-compulsive personality disorder is one of the most prevalent personality dis-\norders in the general population, with estimated prevalence ranging from 2.1% to 7.9%. \nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nIn assessing an individual for obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, the clinician\nshould not include those behaviors that reflect habits, customs, or interpersonal styles that\nare culturally sanctioned by the individual’s reference group. Certain cultures place sub-\nstantial emphasis on work and productivity; the resulting behaviors in members of those\nsocieties need not be considered indications of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nIn systematic studies, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder appears to be diagnosed\nabout twice as often among males.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nDespite the similarity in names, OCD is usually easily\ndistinguished from obsessive-compulsive personality disorder by the presence of true ob-\nsessions and compulsions in OCD. When criteria for both obsessive-compulsive person-\nality disorder and OCD are met, both diagnoses should be recorded.\nHoarding disorder.\nA diagnosis of hoarding disorder should be considered especially\nwhen hoarding is extreme (e.g., accumulated stacks of worthless objects present a fire haz-\nard and make it difficult for others to walk through the house). When criteria for both ob-\nsessive-compulsive personality disorder and hoarding disorder are met, both diagnoses\nshould be recorded. \nOther personality disorders and personality traits.\nOther personality disorders may\nbe confused with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder because they have certain\nfeatures in common. It is, therefore, important to distinguish among these disorders based\non differences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality\nfeatures that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to obsessive-\ncompulsive personality disorder, all can be diagnosed. Individuals with narcissistic per-\nsonality disorder may also profess a commitment to perfectionism and believe that others\ncannot do things as well, but these individuals are more likely to believe that they have\nachieved perfection, whereas those with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder are\nusually self-critical. Individuals with narcissistic or antisocial personality disorder lack\ngenerosity but will indulge themselves, whereas those with obsessive-compulsive person-\nality disorder adopt a miserly spending style toward both self and others. Both schizoid\npersonality disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder may be characterized\nby an apparent formality and social detachment. In obsessive-compulsive personality dis-\norder, this stems from discomfort with emotions and excessive devotion to work, whereas\nin schizoid personality disorder there is a fundamental lack of capacity for intimacy.\n682\nPersonality Disorders\nObsessive-compulsive personality traits in moderation may be especially adaptive, par-\nticularly in situations that reward high performance. Only when these traits are inflexible,\nmaladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment or subjective dis-\ntress do they constitute obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.\nPersonality change due to another medical condition.\nObsessive-compulsive person-\nality disorder must be distinguished from personality change due to another medical con-\ndition, in which the traits emerge attributable to the effects of another medical condition\non the central nervous system.\nSubstance use disorders.\nObsessive-compulsive personality disorder must also be dis-\ntinguished from symptoms that may develop in association with persistent substance use.\nOther Personality Disorders"}

The personality disturbance represents a change from the\nindividual’s previous characteristic personality pattern. In children, this condition may be\nmanifested as a marked deviation from normal development rather than as a change in a\nstable personality pattern (Criterion A). There must be evidence from the history, physical\nexamination, or laboratory findings that the personality change is the direct physiological\nconsequence of another medical condition (Criterion B). The diagnosis is not given if the\ndisturbance is better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion C). The diagnosis is\nnot given if the disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium (Criterion\nD). The disturbance must also cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,\noccupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion E).\nCommon manifestations of the personality change include affective instability, poor\nimpulse control, outbursts of aggression or rage grossly out of proportion to any precipi-\ntating psychosocial stressor, marked apathy, suspiciousness, or paranoid ideation. The\nphenomenology of the change is indicated using the subtypes listed in the criteria set. An\nindividual with the disorder is often characterized by others as “not himself [or herself].”\nAlthough it shares the term “personality” with the other personality disorders, this diag-\nnosis is distinct by virtue of its specific etiology, different phenomenology, and more vari-\nable onset and course.\nThe clinical presentation in a given individual may depend on the nature and localiza-\ntion of the pathological process. For example, injury to the frontal lobes may yield symp-\ntoms such as lack of judgment or foresight, facetiousness, disinhibition, and euphoria.\nRight hemisphere strokes have often been shown to evoke personality changes in asso-\nciation with unilateral spatial neglect, anosognosia (i.e., inability of the individual to\nrecognize a bodily or functional deficit, such as the existence of hemiparesis), motor im-\npersistence, and other neurological deficits.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nA variety of neurological and other medical conditions may cause personality changes,\nincluding central nervous system neoplasms, head trauma, cerebrovascular disease,\nHuntington’s disease, epilepsy, infectious conditions with central nervous system in-\nvolvement (e.g., HIV), endocrine conditions (e.g., hypothyroidism, hypo- and hyperadre-\nnocorticism), and autoimmune conditions with central nervous system involvement (e.g.,\nsystemic lupus erythematosus). The associated physical examination findings, laboratory\nfindings, and patterns of prevalence and onset reflect those of the neurological or other\nmedical condition involved.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nChronic medical conditions associated with pain and disability.\nChronic medical con-\nditions associated with pain and disability can also be associated with changes in person-\nality. The diagnosis of personality change due to another medical condition is given only\nif a direct pathophysiological mechanism can be established. This diagnosis is not given if\nthe change is due to a behavioral or psychological adjustment or response to another med-\nical condition (e.g., dependent behaviors that result from a need for the assistance of others\nfollowing a severe head trauma, cardiovascular disease, or dementia). \n684\nPersonality Disorders\nDelirium or major neurocognitive disorder.\nPersonality change is a frequently associated\nfeature of a delirium or major neurocognitive disorder. A separate diagnosis of personal-\nity change due to another medical condition is not given if the change occurs exclusively\nduring the course of a delirium. However, the diagnosis of personality change due to an-\nother medical condition may be given in addition to the diagnosis of major neurocognitive\ndisorder if the personality change is a prominent part of the clinical presentation.\nAnother mental disorder due to another medical condition.\nThe diagnosis of person-\nality change due to another medical condition is not given if the disturbance is better ex-\nplained by another mental disorder due to another medical condition (e.g., depressive\ndisorder due to brain tumor).\nSubstance use disorders.\nPersonality changes may also occur in the context of substance\nuse disorders, especially if the disorder is long-standing. The clinician should inquire carefully\nabout the nature and extent of substance use. If the clinician wishes to indicate an etiological re-\nlationship between the personality change and substance use, the unspecified category for the\nspecific substance (e.g., unspecified stimulant-related disorder) can be used.\nOther mental disorders.\nMarked personality changes may also be an associated feature\nof other mental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia; delusional disorder; depressive and bipolar\ndisorders; other specified and unspecified disruptive behavior, impulse-control, and con-\nduct disorders; panic disorder). However, in these disorders, no specific physiological fac-\ntor is judged to be etiologically related to the personality change.\nOther personality disorders.\nPersonality change due to another medical condition can\nbe distinguished from a personality disorder by the requirement for a clinically significant\nchange from baseline personality functioning and the presence of a specific etiological\nmedical condition."}
