{"Subcategory":"Bipolar and Related Disorders","Code":null,"Disorder":"Bipolar I Disorder","Content":"Bipolar I Disorder\nDiagnostic Criteria\nFor a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, it is necessary to meet the following criteria for a manic\nepisode. The manic episode may have been preceded by and may be followed by hypo-\nmanic or major depressive episodes.\n124\nBipolar and Related Disorders\nManic Episode\nA. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood\nand abnormally and persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy, lasting at\nleast 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospi-\ntalization is necessary).\nB. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or\nmore) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a sig-\nnificant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior: \n1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.\n2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).\n3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.\n4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.\n5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external\nstimuli), as reported or observed.\n6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or\npsychomotor agitation (i.e., purposeless non-goal-directed activity).\n7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful conse-\nquences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or\nfoolish business investments).\nC. The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or\noccupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or oth-\ners, or there are psychotic features.\nD. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug\nof abuse, a medication, other treatment) or to another medical condition.\nNote: A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medi-\ncation, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the\nphysiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and,\ntherefore, a bipolar I diagnosis.\nNote: Criteria A–D constitute a manic episode. At least one lifetime manic episode is re-\nquired for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.\nHypomanic Episode\nA. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood\nand abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 4 consec-\nutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day.\nB. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and activity, three (or\nmore) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) have persisted, rep-\nresent a noticeable change from usual behavior, and have been present to a significant\ndegree:\n1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.\n2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).\n3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.\n4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.\n5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external\nstimuli), as reported or observed.\n6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or\npsychomotor agitation.\n7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful conse-\nquences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or\nfoolish business investments).\nBipolar I Disorder\n125\nC. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is uncharac-\nteristic of the individual when not symptomatic.\nD. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable by others.\nE. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupa-\ntional functioning or to necessitate hospitalization. If there are psychotic features, the\nepisode is, by definition, manic.\nF. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug\nof abuse, a medication, other treatment).\nNote: A full hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g.,\nmedication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond\nthe physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a hypomanic episode\ndiagnosis. However, caution is indicated so that one or two symptoms (particularly in-\ncreased irritability, edginess, or agitation following antidepressant use) are not taken\nas sufficient for diagnosis of a hypomanic episode, nor necessarily indicative of a bi-\npolar diathesis.\nNote: Criteria A–F constitute a hypomanic episode. Hypomanic episodes are common in\nbipolar I disorder but are not required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.\nMajor Depressive Episode\nA. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week\nperiod and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms\nis either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.\nNote: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical condi-\ntion.\n1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjec-\ntive report (e.g., feels sad, empty, or hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g.,\nappears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)\n2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the\nday, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation).\n3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than\n5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every\nday. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)\n4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.\n5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others; not\nmerely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).\n6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.\n7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delu-\nsional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).\n8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (ei-\nther by subjective account or as observed by others).\n9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation with-\nout a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.\nB. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning.\nC. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another\nmedical condition. \nNote: Criteria A–C constitute a major depressive episode. Major depressive episodes are\ncommon in bipolar I disorder but are not required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.\nNote: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a\nnatural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense\n126\nBipolar and Related Disorders\nsadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Cri-\nterion A, which may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms may be un-\nderstandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive\nepisode in addition to the normal response to a significant loss should also be carefully\nconsidered. This decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on\nthe individual’s history and the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context\nof loss.1\nBipolar I Disorder\nA. Criteria have been met for at least one manic episode (Criteria A–D under “Manic Ep-\nisode” above).\nB. The occurrence of the manic and major depressive episode(s) is not better explained\nby schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional dis-\norder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic\ndisorder.\nCoding and Recording Procedures\nThe diagnostic code for bipolar I disorder is based on type of current or most recent epi-\nsode and its status with respect to current severity, presence of psychotic features, and\nremission status. Current severity and psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria\nare currently met for a manic or major depressive episode. Remission specifiers are only\nindicated if the full criteria are not currently met for a manic, hypomanic, or major depres-\nsive episode. Codes are as follows:\n1In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that in\ngrief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss, while in MDE it is persistent\ndepressed mood and the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is\nlikely to decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of\ngrief. These waves tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The\ndepressed mood of a MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations.\nThe pain of grief may be accompanied by positive emotions and humor that are uncharacteristic\nof the pervasive unhappiness and misery characteristic of a major depressive episode. The\nthought content associated with grief generally features a preoccupation with thoughts and\nmemories of the deceased, rather than the self-critical or pessimistic ruminations seen in a MDE.\nIn grief, self-esteem is generally preserved, whereas in a MDE, feelings of worthlessness and self-\nloathing are common. If self-derogatory ideation is present in grief, it typically involves per-\nceived failings vis-à-vis the deceased (e.g., not visiting frequently enough, not telling the\ndeceased how much he or she was loved). If a bereaved individual thinks about death and dying,\nsuch thoughts are generally focused on the deceased and possibly about “joining” the deceased,\nwhereas in a major depressive episode such thoughts are focused on ending one’s own life\nbecause of feeling worthless, undeserving of life, or unable to cope with the pain of depression.\nBipolar I disorder\nCurrent or \nmost recent \nepisode \nmanic\nCurrent or \nmost recent \nepisode \nhypomanic* \nCurrent or \nmost recent \nepisode \ndepressed\nCurrent or \nmost recent \nepisode \nunspecified**\nMild (p. 154)\n296.41 \n(F31.11)\nNA\n296.51 \n(F31.31)\nNA\nModerate (p. 154)\n296.42 \n(F31.12)\nNA\n296.52 \n(F31.32)\nNA\nSevere (p. 154)\n296.43 \n(F31.13)\nNA\n296.53 \n(F31.4)\nNA\nBipolar I Disorder\n127\nIn recording the name of a diagnosis, terms should be listed in the following order: bipolar\nI disorder, type of current or most recent episode, severity\/psychotic\/remission specifiers,\nfollowed by as many specifiers without codes as apply to the current or most recent epi-\nsode.\nSpecify:\nWith anxious distress (p. 149)\nWith mixed features (pp. 149–150)\nWith rapid cycling (pp. 150–151)\nWith melancholic features (p. 151)\nWith atypical features (pp. 151–152)\nWith mood-congruent psychotic features (p. 152)\nWith mood-incongruent psychotic features (p. 152)\nWith catatonia (p. 152).

If the mood is irritable rather than elevated or ex-\npansive, at least four Criterion B symptoms must be present.\nMood in a manic episode is often described as euphoric, excessively cheerful, high, or\n“feeling on top of the world.” In some cases, the mood is of such a highly infectious quality\nthat it is easily recognized as excessive and may be characterized by unlimited and hap-\nhazard enthusiasm for interpersonal, sexual, or occupational interactions. For example,\nthe individual may spontaneously start extensive conversations with strangers in public.\nOften the predominant mood is irritable rather than elevated, particularly when the indi-\nvidual’s wishes are denied or if the individual has been using substances. Rapid shifts in\nmood over brief periods of time may occur and are referred to as lability (i.e., the alterna-\nWith psychotic \nfeatures*** \n(p. 152)\n296.44 \n(F31.2)\nNA\n296.54 \n(F31.5)\nNA\nIn partial \nremission (p. 154)\n296.45 \n(F31.73)\n296.45 \n(F31.71)\n296.55 \n(F31.75)\nNA\nIn full remission \n(p. 154)\n296.46 \n(F31.74)\n296.46 \n(F31.72)\n296.56 \n(F31.76)\nNA\nUnspecified\n296.40 \n(F31.9)\n296.40 \n(F31.9)\n296.50 \n(F31.9)\nNA\n*Severity and psychotic specifiers do not apply; code 296.40 (F31.0) for cases not in remission.\n**Severity, psychotic, and remission specifiers do not apply.

In children, happiness, silliness and\n“goofiness” are normal in the context of special occasions; however, if these symptoms are\nrecurrent, inappropriate to the context, and beyond what is expected for the developmen-\ntal level of the child, they may meet Criterion A. If the happiness is unusual for a child (i.e.,\ndistinct from baseline), and the mood change occurs at the same time as symptoms that\nmeet Criterion B for mania, diagnostic certainty is increased; however, the mood change\nmust be accompanied by persistently increased activity or energy levels that are obvious\nto those who know the child well.\nDuring the manic episode, the individual may engage in multiple overlapping new\nprojects. The projects are often initiated with little knowledge of the topic, and nothing seems\nout of the individual’s reach. The increased activity levels may manifest at unusual hours of\nthe day.\nInflated self-esteem is typically present, ranging from uncritical self-confidence to marked\ngrandiosity, and may reach delusional proportions (Criterion B1). Despite lack of any partic-\nular experience or talent, the individual may embark on complex tasks such as writing a novel\nor seeking publicity for some impractical invention. Grandiose delusions (e.g., of having a\nspecial relationship to a famous person) are common. In children, overestimation of abilities\nand belief that, for example, they are the best at a sport or the smartest in the class is normal;\nhowever, when such beliefs are present despite clear evidence to the contrary or the child at-\ntempts feats that are clearly dangerous and, most important, represent a change from the\nchild’s normal behavior, the grandiosity criterion should be considered satisfied. \nOne of the most common features is a decreased need for sleep (Criterion B2) and is\ndistinct from insomnia in which the individual wants to sleep or feels the need to sleep but\nis unable. The individual may sleep little, if at all, or may awaken several hours earlier than\nusual, feeling rested and full of energy. When the sleep disturbance is severe, the individ-\nual may go for days without sleep, yet not feel tired. Often a decreased need for sleep her-\nalds the onset of a manic episode.\nSpeech can be rapid, pressured, loud, and difficult to interrupt (Criterion B3). Individ-\nuals may talk continuously and without regard for others’ wishes to communicate, often\nin an intrusive manner or without concern for the relevance of what is said. Speech is\nsometimes characterized by jokes, puns, amusing irrelevancies, and theatricality, with\ndramatic mannerisms, singing, and excessive gesturing. Loudness and forcefulness of\nspeech often become more important than what is conveyed. If the individual’s mood is\nmore irritable than expansive, speech may be marked by complaints, hostile comments, or\nangry tirades, particularly if attempts are made to interrupt the individual. Both Criterion\nA and Criterion B symptoms may be accompanied by symptoms of the opposite (i.e., de-\npressive) pole (see “with mixed features” specifier, pp. 149–150).\nOften the individual’s thoughts race at a rate faster than they can be expressed through\nspeech (Criterion B4). Frequently there is flight of ideas evidenced by a nearly continuous flow\nof accelerated speech, with abrupt shifts from one topic to another. When flight of ideas is se-\nvere, speech may become disorganized, incoherent, and particularly distressful to the individ-\nual. Sometimes thoughts are experienced as so crowded that it is very difficult to speak.\nDistractibility (Criterion B5) is evidenced by an inability to censor immaterial external\nstimuli (e.g., the interviewer’s attire, background noises or conversations, furnishings in\nthe room) and often prevents individuals experiencing mania from holding a rational con-\nversation or attending to instructions.\nThe increase in goal-directed activity often consists of excessive planning and partici-\npation in multiple activities, including sexual, occupational, political, or religious activi-\nties. Increased sexual drive, fantasies, and behavior are often present. Individuals in a manic\nepisode usually show increased sociability (e.g., renewing old acquaintances or calling or\ncontacting friends or even strangers), without regard to the intrusive, domineering, and\ndemanding nature of these interactions. They often display psychomotor agitation or rest-\nlessness (i.e., purposeless activity) by pacing or by holding multiple conversations simulta-\nBipolar I Disorder\n129\nneously. Some individuals write excessive letters, e-mails, text messages, and so forth, on\nmany different topics to friends, public figures, or the media. \nThe increased activity criterion can be difficult to ascertain in children; however, when\nthe child takes on many tasks simultaneously, starts devising elaborate and unrealistic\nplans for projects, develops previously absent and developmentally inappropriate sexual\npreoccupations (not accounted for by sexual abuse or exposure to sexually explicit mate-\nrial), then Criterion B might be met based on clinical judgment. It is essential to determine\nwhether the behavior represents a change from the child’s baseline behavior; occurs most\nof the day, nearly every day for the requisite time period; and occurs in temporal associa-\ntion with other symptoms of mania. \nThe expansive mood, excessive optimism, grandiosity, and poor judgment often lead\nto reckless involvement in activities such as spending sprees, giving away possessions,\nreckless driving, foolish business investments, and sexual promiscuity that is unusual for\nthe individual, even though these activities are likely to have catastrophic consequences\n(Criterion B7). The individual may purchase many unneeded items without the money to\npay for them and, in some cases, give them away. Sexual behavior may include infidelity\nor indiscriminate sexual encounters with strangers, often disregarding the risk of sexually\ntransmitted diseases or interpersonal consequences.\nThe manic episode must result in marked impairment in social or occupational func-\ntioning or require hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others (e.g., financial losses, il-\nlegal activities, loss of employment, self-injurious behavior). By definition, the presence of\npsychotic features during a manic episode also satisfies Criterion C.\nManic symptoms or syndromes that are attributable to the physiological effects of a\ndrug of abuse (e.g., in the context of cocaine or amphetamine intoxication), the side effects\nof medications or treatments (e.g., steroids, L-dopa, antidepressants, stimulants), or an-\nother medical condition do not count toward the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. However,\na fully syndromal manic episode that arises during treatment (e.g., with medications, elec-\ntroconvulsive therapy, light therapy) or drug use and persists beyond the physiological ef-\nfect of the inducing agent (i.e., after a medication is fully out of the individual’s system or\nthe effects of electroconvulsive therapy would be expected to have dissipated completely)\nis sufficient evidence for a manic episode diagnosis (Criterion D). Caution is indicated so\nthat one or two symptoms (particularly increased irritability, edginess, or agitation follow-\ning antidepressant use) are not taken as sufficient for diagnosis of a manic or hypomanic\nepisode, nor necessarily an indication of a bipolar disorder diathesis. It is necessary to\nmeet criteria for a manic episode to make a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, but it is not re-\nquired to have hypomanic or major depressive episodes. However, they may precede or\nfollow a manic episode. Full descriptions of the diagnostic features of a hypomanic epi-\nsode may be found within the text for bipolar II disorder, and the features of a major de-\npressive episode are described within the text for major depressive disorder.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nDuring a manic episode, individuals often do not perceive that they are ill or in need of treat-\nment and vehemently resist efforts to be treated. Individuals may change their dress, makeup,\nor personal appearance to a more sexually suggestive or flamboyant style. Some perceive a\nsharper sense of smell, hearing, or vision. Gambling and antisocial behaviors may accompany\nthe manic episode. Some individuals may become hostile and physically threatening to others\nand, when delusional, may become physically assaultive or suicidal. Catastrophic conse-\nquences of a manic episode (e.g., involuntary hospitalization, difficulties with the law, serious\nfinancial difficulties) often result from poor judgment, loss of insight, and hyperactivity. \nMood may shift very rapidly to anger or depression. Depressive symptoms may occur\nduring a manic episode and, if present, may last moments, hours, or, more rarely, days (see\n“with mixed features” specifier, pp. 149–150).\n130\nBipolar and Related Disorders\nPrevalence\nThe 12-month prevalence estimate in the continental United States was 0.6% for bipolar I\ndisorder as defined in DSM-IV. Twelve-month prevalence of bipolar I disorder across 11\ncountries ranged from 0.0% to 0.6%. The lifetime male-to-female prevalence ratio is ap-\nproximately 1.1:1. \nDevelopment and Course\nMean age at onset of the first manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode is approxi-\nmately 18 years for bipolar I disorder. Special considerations are necessary to detect the di-\nagnosis in children. Since children of the same chronological age may be at different\ndevelopmental stages, it is difficult to define with precision what is “normal” or “ex-\npected” at any given point. Therefore, each child should be judged according to his or her\nown baseline. Onset occurs throughout the life cycle, including first onsets in the 60s or\n70s. Onset of manic symptoms (e.g., sexual or social disinhibition) in late mid-life or late-\nlife should prompt consideration of medical conditions (e.g., frontotemporal neurocogni-\ntive disorder) and of substance ingestion or withdrawal. \nMore than 90% of individuals who have a single manic episode go on to have recurrent\nmood episodes. Approximately 60% of manic episodes occur immediately before a major\ndepressive episode. Individuals with bipolar I disorder who have multiple (four or more)\nmood episodes (major depressive, manic, or hypomanic) within 1 year receive the speci-\nfier “with rapid cycling.” \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nEnvironmental. Bipolar disorder is more common in high-income than in low-income\ncountries (1.4 vs. 0.7%). Separated, divorced, or widowed individuals have higher rates of\nbipolar I disorder than do individuals who are married or have never been married, but\nthe direction of the association is unclear. \nGenetic and physiological. A family history of bipolar disorder is one of the strongest and\nmost consistent risk factors for bipolar disorders. There is an average 10-fold increased risk\namong adult relatives of individuals with bipolar I and bipolar II disorders. Magnitude of\nrisk increases with degree of kinship. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder likely share a ge-\nnetic origin, reflected in familial co-aggregation of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. \nCourse modifiers. After an individual has a manic episode with psychotic features, subse-\nquent manic episodes are more likely to include psychotic features. Incomplete inter-\nepisode recovery is more common when the current episode is accompanied by mood-\nincongruent psychotic features.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nLittle information exists on specific cultural differences in the expression of bipolar I dis-\norder. One possible explanation for this may be that diagnostic instruments are often\ntranslated and applied in different cultures with no transcultural validation. In one U.S.\nstudy, 12-month prevalence of bipolar I disorder was significantly lower for Afro-Carib-\nbeans than for African Americans or whites. \nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nFemales are more likely to experience rapid cycling and mixed states, and to have patterns of\ncomorbidity that differ from those of males, including higher rates of lifetime eating disor-\nders. Females with bipolar I or II disorder are more likely to experience depressive symptoms\nthan males. They also have a higher lifetime risk of alcohol use disorder than are males and a\nmuch greater likelihood of alcohol use disorder than do females in the general population.\nBipolar I Disorder\n131\nSuicide Risk\nThe lifetime risk of suicide in individuals with bipolar disorder is estimated to be at least\n15 times that of the general population. In fact, bipolar disorder may account for one-quar-\nter of all completed suicides. A past history of suicide attempt and percent days spent de-\npressed in the past year are associated with greater risk of suicide attempts or completions.\nFunctional Consequences of Bipolar I Disorder\nAlthough many individuals with bipolar disorder return to a fully functional level be-\ntween episodes, approximately 30% show severe impairment in work role function. Func-\ntional recovery lags substantially behind recovery from symptoms, especially with respect\nto occupational recovery, resulting in lower socioeconomic status despite equivalent lev-\nels of education when compared with the general population. Individuals with bipolar I\ndisorder perform more poorly than healthy individuals on cognitive tests. Cognitive im-\npairments may contribute to vocational and interpersonal difficulties and persist through\nthe lifespan, even during euthymic periods.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nMajor depressive disorder.\nMajor depressive disorder may also be accompanied by hy-\npomanic or manic symptoms (i.e., fewer symptoms or for a shorter duration than required\nfor mania or hypomania). When the individual presents in an episode of major depression,\none must depend on corroborating history regarding past episodes of mania or hypoma-\nnia. Symptoms of irritability may be associated with either major depressive disorder or\nbipolar disorder, adding to diagnostic complexity.\nOther bipolar disorders.\nDiagnosis of bipolar I disorder is differentiated from bipolar II\ndisorder by determining whether there have been any past episodes of mania. Other spec-\nified and unspecified bipolar and related disorders should be differentiated from bipolar I\nand II disorders by considering whether either the episodes involving manic or hypo-\nmanic symptoms or the episodes of depressive symptoms fail to meet the full criteria for\nthose conditions.\nBipolar disorder due to another medical condition may be distinguished from bipolar\nI and II disorders by identifying, based on best clinical evidence, a causally related medical\ncondition.\nGeneralized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, or other\nanxiety disorders.\nThese disorders need to be considered in the differential diagnosis as\neither the primary disorder or, in some cases, a comorbid disorder. A careful history of\nsymptoms is needed to differentiate generalized anxiety disorder from bipolar disorder,\nas anxious ruminations may be mistaken for racing thoughts, and efforts to minimize anx-\nious feelings may be taken as impulsive behavior. Similarly, symptoms of posttraumatic\nstress disorder need to be differentiated from bipolar disorder. It is helpful to assess the ep-\nisodic nature of the symptoms described, as well as to consider symptom triggers, in mak-\ning this differential diagnosis.\nSubstance\/medication-induced bipolar disorder.\nSubstance use disorders may mani-\nfest with substance.medication-induced manic symptoms that must be distinguished\nfrom bipolar I disorder; response to mood stabilizers during a substance\/medication-\ninduced mania may not necessarily be diagnostic for bipolar disorder. There may be sub-\nstantial overlap in view of the tendency for individuals with bipolar I disorder to overuse\nsubstances during an episode. A primary diagnosis of bipolar disorder must be estab-\nlished based on symptoms that remain once substances are no longer being used.\nAttention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder.\nThis disorder may be misdiagnosed as bipolar\ndisorder, especially in adolescents and children. Many symptoms overlap with the symp-\n132\nBipolar and Related Disorders\ntoms of mania, such as rapid speech, racing thoughts, distractibility, and less need for\nsleep. The “double counting” of symptoms toward both ADHD and bipolar disorder can\nbe avoided if the clinician clarifies whether the symptom(s) represents a distinct episode. \nPersonality disorders.\nPersonality disorders such as borderline personality disorder\nmay have substantial symptomatic overlap with bipolar disorders, since mood lability\nand impulsivity are common in both conditions. Symptoms must represent a distinct ep-\nisode, and the noticeable increase over baseline required for the diagnosis of bipolar dis-\norder must be present. A diagnosis of a personality disorder should not be made during an\nuntreated mood episode.\nDisorders with prominent irritability.\nIn individuals with severe irritability, particularly\nchildren and adolescents, care must be taken to apply the diagnosis of bipolar disorder\nonly to those who have had a clear episode of mania or hypomania—that is, a distinct time\nperiod, of the required duration, during which the irritability was clearly different from\nthe individual’s baseline and was accompanied by the onset of Criterion B symptoms.\nWhen a child’s irritability is persistent and particularly severe, the diagnosis of disruptive\nmood dysregulation disorder would be more appropriate. Indeed, when any child is being\nassessed for mania, it is essential that the symptoms represent a clear change from the\nchild’s typical behavior.\nComorbidity\nCo-occurring mental disorders are common, with the most frequent disorders being any\nanxiety disorder (e.g., panic attacks, social anxiety disorder [social phobia], specific pho-\nbia), occurring in approximately three-fourths of individuals; ADHD, any disruptive, im-\npulse-control, or conduct disorder (e.g., intermittent explosive disorder, oppositional\ndefiant disorder, conduct disorder), and any substance use disorder (e.g., alcohol use dis-\norder) occur in over half of individuals with bipolar I disorder. Adults with bipolar I dis-\norder have high rates of serious and\/or untreated co-occurring medical conditions.\nMetabolic syndrome and migraine are more common among individuals with bipolar dis-\norder than in the general population. More than half of individuals whose symptoms meet\ncriteria for bipolar disorder have an alcohol use disorder, and those with both disorders\nare at greater risk for suicide attempt."}

The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug\nof abuse, a medication or other treatment).\nNote: A full hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g.,\nmedication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond\nthe physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a hypomanic episode\ndiagnosis. However, caution is indicated so that one or two symptoms (particularly in-\ncreased irritability, edginess, or agitation following antidepressant use) are not taken\nas sufficient for diagnosis of a hypomanic episode, nor necessarily indicative of a bi-\npolar diathesis.\nMajor Depressive Episode\nA. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week\nperiod and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms\nis either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.\nNote: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to a medical condition.\n1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjec-\ntive report (e.g., feels sad, empty, or hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g.,\nappears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)\n2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the\nday, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation).\n3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than\n5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every\nday. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)\n4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.\n5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others; not\nmerely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).\n6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.\n7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delu-\nsional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).\n8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (ei-\nther by subjective account or as observed by others).\n9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation with-\nout a specific plan, a suicide attempt, or a specific plan for committing suicide.\nB. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning. \nC. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another\nmedical condition.\n134\nBipolar and Related Disorders\nNote: Criteria A–C above constitute a major depressive episode.\nNote: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a nat-\nural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense sad-\nness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion\nA, which may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms may be under-\nstandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive episode\nin addition to the normal response to a significant loss should be carefully considered. This\ndecision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual’s history\nand the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss.1 \nBipolar II Disorder\nA. Criteria have been met for at least one hypomanic episode (Criteria A–F under “Hypo-\nmanic Episode” above) and at least one major depressive episode (Criteria A–C under\n“Major Depressive Episode” above).\nB. There has never been a manic episode.\nC. The occurrence of the hypomanic episode(s) and major depressive episode(s) is not\nbetter explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disor-\nder, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and\nother psychotic disorder.\nD. The symptoms of depression or the unpredictability caused by frequent alternation be-\ntween periods of depression and hypomania causes clinically significant distress or im-\npairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\nCoding and Recording Procedures\nBipolar II disorder has one diagnostic code: 296.89 (F31.81). Its status with respect to cur-\nrent severity, presence of psychotic features, course, and other specifiers cannot be\ncoded but should be indicated in writing (e.g., 296.89 [F31.81] bipolar II disorder, current\nepisode depressed, moderate severity, with mixed features; 296.89 [F31.81] bipolar II dis-\norder, most recent episode depressed, in partial remission).\nSpecify current or most recent episode: \nHypomanic \nDepressed\nSpecify if:\nWith anxious distress (p. 149)\nWith mixed features (pp. 149–150)\n1In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that in grief\nthe predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss, while in a MDE it is persistent depressed\nmood and the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is likely to\ndecrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of grief. These\nwaves tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The depressed mood of a\nMDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations. The pain of grief may\nbe accompanied by positive emotions and humor that are uncharacteristic of the pervasive unhap-\npiness and misery characteristic of a MDE. The thought content associated with grief generally fea-\ntures a preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the deceased, rather than the self-critical or\npessimistic ruminations seen in a MDE. In grief, self-esteem is generally preserved, whereas in a\nMDE feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common. If self-derogatory ideation is present\nin grief, it typically involves perceived failings vis-à-vis the deceased (e.g., not visiting frequently\nenough, not telling the deceased how much he or she was loved). If a bereaved individual thinks\nabout death and dying, such thoughts are generally focused on the deceased and possibly about\n“'joining” the deceased, whereas in a MDE such thoughts are focused on ending one’s own life\nbecause of feeling worthless, undeserving of life, or unable to cope with the pain of depression.\nBipolar II Disorder\n135\nWith rapid cycling (pp. 150–151)\nWith mood-congruent psychotic features (p. 152)\nWith mood-incongruent psychotic features (p. 152)\nWith catatonia (p. 152). Coding note: Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1).\nWith peripartum onset (pp. 152–153)\nWith seasonal pattern (pp. 153–154): Applies only to the pattern of major depressive\nepisodes.\nSpecify course if full criteria for a mood episode are not currently met:\nIn partial remission (p. 154)\nIn full remission (p. 154)\nSpecify severity if full criteria for a mood episode are currently met:\nMild (p. 154)\nModerate (p. 154)\nSevere (p. 154)\nDiagnostic Features\nBipolar II disorder is characterized by a clinical course of recurring mood episodes con-\nsisting of one or more major depressive episodes (Criteria A–C under “Major Depressive\nEpisode”) and at least one hypomanic episode (Criteria A–F under “Hypomanic Epi-\nsode”). The major depressive episode must last at least 2 weeks, and the hypomanic epi-\nsode must last at least 4 days, to meet the diagnostic criteria. During the mood episode(s),\nthe requisite number of symptoms must be present most of the day, nearly every day, and\nrepresent a noticeable change from usual behavior and functioning. The presence of a\nmanic episode during the course of illness precludes the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder\n(Criterion B under “Bipolar II Disorder”). Episodes of substance\/medication-induced de-\npressive disorder or substance\/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder (repre-\nsenting the physiological effects of a medication, other somatic treatments for depression,\ndrugs of abuse, or toxin exposure) or of depressive and related disorder due to another\nmedical condition or bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition do not\ncount toward a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder unless they persist beyond the physiolog-\nical effects of the treatment or substance and then meet duration criteria for an episode. In\naddition, the episodes must not be better accounted for by schizoaffective disorder and are\nnot superimposed on schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or\nother specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorders (Cri-\nterion C under “Bipolar II Disorder”). The depressive episodes or hypomanic fluctuations\nmust cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other\nimportant areas of functioning (Criterion D under “Bipolar II Disorder”); however, for hy-\npomanic episodes, this requirement does not have to be met. A hypomanic episode that\ncauses significant impairment would likely qualify for the diagnosis of manic episode and,\ntherefore, for a lifetime diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. The recurrent major depressive ep-\nisodes are often more frequent and lengthier than those occurring in bipolar I disorder.\nIndividuals with bipolar II disorder typically present to a clinician during a major de-\npressive episode and are unlikely to complain initially of hypomania. Typically, the hy-\npomanic episodes themselves do not cause impairment. Instead, the impairment results\nfrom the major depressive episodes or from a persistent pattern of unpredictable mood\nchanges and fluctuating, unreliable interpersonal or occupational functioning. Individu-\nals with bipolar II disorder may not view the hypomanic episodes as pathological or dis-\nadvantageous, although others may be troubled by the individual’s erratic behavior.\nClinical information from other informants, such as close friends or relatives, is often use-\nful in establishing the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder. \n136\nBipolar and Related Disorders\nA hypomanic episode should not be confused with the several days of euthymia and re-\nstored energy or activity that may follow remission of a major depressive episode. Despite the\nsubstantial differences in duration and severity between a manic and hypomanic episode, bi-\npolar II disorder is not a “milder form” of bipolar I disorder. Compared with individuals with\nbipolar I disorder, individuals with bipolar II disorder have greater chronicity of illness and\nspend, on average, more time in the depressive phase of their illness, which can be severe and\/\nor disabling. Depressive symptoms co-occurring with a hypomanic episode or hypomanic\nsymptoms co-occurring with a depressive episode are common in individuals with bipolar II\ndisorder and are overrepresented in females, particularly hypomania with mixed features. In-\ndividuals experiencing hypomania with mixed features may not label their symptoms as hy-\npomania, but instead experience them as depression with increased energy or irritability.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nA common feature of bipolar II disorder is impulsivity, which can contribute to suicide at-\ntempts and substance use disorders. Impulsivity may also stem from a concurrent person-\nality disorder, substance use disorder, anxiety disorder, another mental disorder, or a\nmedical condition. There may be heightened levels of creativity in some individuals with\na bipolar disorder. However, that relationship may be nonlinear; that is, greater lifetime\ncreative accomplishments have been associated with milder forms of bipolar disorder, and\nhigher creativity has been found in unaffected family members. The individual’s attach-\nment to heightened creativity during hypomanic episodes may contribute to ambivalence\nabout seeking treatment or undermine adherence to treatment. \nPrevalence\nThe 12-month prevalence of bipolar II disorder, internationally, is 0.3%. In the United\nStates, 12-month prevalence is 0.8%. The prevalence rate of pediatric bipolar II disorder is\ndifficult to establish. DSM-IV bipolar I, bipolar II, and bipolar disorder not otherwise spec-\nified yield a combined prevalence rate of 1.8% in U.S. and non-U.S. community samples,\nwith higher rates (2.7% inclusive) in youths age 12 years or older. \nDevelopment and Course\nAlthough bipolar II disorder can begin in late adolescence and throughout adulthood, av-\nerage age at onset is the mid-20s, which is slightly later than for bipolar I disorder but ear-\nlier than for major depressive disorder. The illness most often begins with a depressive\nepisode and is not recognized as bipolar II disorder until a hypomanic episode occurs; this\nhappens in about 12% of individuals with the initial diagnosis of major depressive disor-\nder. Anxiety, substance use, or eating disorders may also precede the diagnosis, compli-\ncating its detection. Many individuals experience several episodes of major depression\nprior to the first recognized hypomanic episode. \nThe number of lifetime episodes (both hypomanic and major depressive episodes)\ntends to be higher for bipolar II disorder than for major depressive disorder or bipolar I\ndisorder. However, individuals with bipolar I disorder are actually more likely to experi-\nence hypomanic symptoms than are individuals with bipolar II disorder.The interval\nbetween mood episodes in the course of bipolar II disorder tends to decrease as the indi-\nvidual ages. While the hypomanic episode is the feature that defines bipolar II disorder,\ndepressive episodes are more enduring and disabling over time. Despite the predomi-\nnance of depression, once a hypomanic episode has occurred, the diagnosis becomes bi-\npolar II disorder and never reverts to major depressive disorder.\nApproximately 5%–15% of individuals with bipolar II disorder have multiple (four or\nmore) mood episodes (hypomanic or major depressive) within the previous 12 months. If\nBipolar II Disorder\n137\nthis pattern is present, it is noted by the specifier “with rapid cycling.” By definition, psy-\nchotic symptoms do not occur in hypomanic episodes, and they appear to be less frequent\nin the major depressive episodes in bipolar II disorder than in those of bipolar I disorder. \nSwitching from a depressive episode to a manic or hypomanic episode (with or with-\nout mixed features) may occur, both spontaneously and during treatment for depression.\nAbout 5%–15% of individuals with bipolar II disorder will ultimately develop a manic ep-\nisode, which changes the diagnosis to bipolar I disorder, regardless of subsequent course. \nMaking the diagnosis in children is often a challenge, especially in those with irritabil-\nity and hyperarousal that is nonepisodic (i.e., lacks the well-demarcated periods of altered\nmood). Nonepisodic irritability in youth is associated with an elevated risk for anxiety dis-\norders and major depressive disorder, but not bipolar disorder, in adulthood. Persistently\nirritable youths have lower familial rates of bipolar disorder than do youths who have bi-\npolar disorder. For a hypomanic episode to be diagnosed, the child’s symptoms must ex-\nceed what is expected in a given environment and culture for the child’s developmental\nstage. Compared with adult onset of bipolar II disorder, childhood or adolescent onset of\nthe disorder may be associated with a more severe lifetime course. The 3-year incidence\nrate of first-onset bipolar II disorder in adults older than 60 years is 0.34%. However, dis-\ntinguishing individuals older than 60 years with bipolar II disorder by late versus early\nage at onset does not appear to have any clinical utility.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nGenetic and physiological.\nThe risk of bipolar II disorder tends to be highest among rel-\natives of individuals with bipolar II disorder, as opposed to individuals with bipolar I dis-\norder or major depressive disorder. There may be genetic factors influencing the age at\nonset for bipolar disorders.\nCourse modifiers.\nA rapid-cycling pattern is associated with a poorer prognosis. Return\nto previous level of social function for individuals with bipolar II disorder is more likely\nfor individuals of younger age and with less severe depression, suggesting adverse effects\nof prolonged illness on recovery. More education, fewer years of illness, and being mar-\nried are independently associated with functional recovery in individuals with bipolar\ndisorder, even after diagnostic type (I vs. II), current depressive symptoms, and presence\nof psychiatric comorbidity are taken into account.\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nWhereas the gender ratio for bipolar I disorder is equal, findings on gender differences in\nbipolar II disorder are mixed, differing by type of sample (i.e., registry, community, or\nclinical) and country of origin. There is little to no evidence of bipolar gender differences,\nwhereas some, but not all, clinical samples suggest that bipolar II disorder is more com-\nmon in females than in males, which may reflect gender differences in treatment seeking\nor other factors. \nPatterns of illness and comorbidity, however, seem to differ by gender, with females\nbeing more likely than males to report hypomania with mixed depressive features and a\nrapid-cycling course. Childbirth may be a specific trigger for a hypomanic episode, which\ncan occur in 10%–20% of females in nonclinical populations and most typically in the early\npostpartum period. Distinguishing hypomania from the elated mood and reduced sleep\nthat normally accompany the birth of a child may be challenging. Postpartum hypomania\nmay foreshadow the onset of a depression that occurs in about half of females who expe-\nrience postpartum “highs.” Accurate detection of bipolar II disorder may help in estab-\nlishing appropriate treatment of the depression, which may reduce the risk of suicide and\ninfanticide. \n138\nBipolar and Related Disorders\nSuicide Risk\nSuicide risk is high in bipolar II disorder. Approximately one-third of individuals with bi-\npolar II disorder report a lifetime history of suicide attempt. The prevalence rates of life-\ntime attempted suicide in bipolar II and bipolar I disorder appear to be similar (32.4% and\n36.3%, respectively). However, the lethality of attempts, as defined by a lower ratio of at-\ntempts to completed suicides, may be higher in individuals with bipolar II disorder com-\npared with individuals with bipolar I disorder. There may be an association between\ngenetic markers and increased risk for suicidal behavior in individuals with bipolar dis-\norder, including a 6.5-fold higher risk of suicide among first-degree relatives of bipolar II\nprobands compared with those with bipolar I disorder. \nFunctional Consequences of Bipolar II Disorder\nAlthough many individuals with bipolar II disorder return to a fully functional level be-\ntween mood episodes, at least 15% continue to have some inter-episode dysfunction, and\n20% transition directly into another mood episode without inter-episode recovery. Func-\ntional recovery lags substantially behind recovery from symptoms of bipolar II disorder,\nespecially in regard to occupational recovery, resulting in lower socioeconomic status de-\nspite equivalent levels of education with the general population. Individuals with bipolar\nII disorder perform more poorly than healthy individuals on cognitive tests and, with the\nexception of memory and semantic fluency, have similar cognitive impairment as do in-\ndividuals with bipolar I disorder. Cognitive impairments associated with bipolar II disor-\nder may contribute to vocational difficulties. Prolonged unemployment in individuals\nwith bipolar disorder is associated with more episodes of depression, older age, increased\nrates of current panic disorder, and lifetime history of alcohol use disorder.\nDifferential Diagnosis \nMajor depressive disorder.\nPerhaps the most challenging differential diagnosis to con-\nsider is major depressive disorder, which may be accompanied by hypomanic or manic\nsymptoms that do not meet full criteria (i.e., either fewer symptoms or a shorter duration\nthan required for a hypomanic episode). This is especially true in evaluating individuals\nwith symptoms of irritability, which may be associated with either major depressive dis-\norder or bipolar II disorder. \nCyclothymic disorder.\nIn cyclothymic disorder, there are numerous periods of hypo-\nmanic symptoms and numerous periods of depressive symptoms that do not meet symp-\ntom or duration criteria for a major depressive episode. Bipolar II disorder is distinguished\nfrom cyclothymic disorder by the presence of one or more major depressive episodes. If a\nmajor depressive episode occurs after the first 2 years of cyclothymic disorder, the addi-\ntional diagnosis of bipolar II disorder is given.\nSchizophrenia spectrum and other related psychotic disorders.\nBipolar II disorder must\nbe distinguished from psychotic disorders (e.g., schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia,\nand delusional disorder). Schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and delusional disor-\nder are all characterized by periods of psychotic symptoms that occur in the absence of\nprominent mood symptoms. Other helpful considerations include the accompanying\nsymptoms, previous course, and family history.\nPanic disorder or other anxiety disorders.\nAnxiety disorders need to be considered in\nthe differential diagnosis and may frequently be present as co-occurring disorders.\nSubstance use disorders.\nSubstance use disorders are included in the differential diag-\nnosis. \nAttention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder.\nAttention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\nmay be misdiagnosed as bipolar II disorder, especially in adolescents and children. Many\nCyclothymic Disorder\n139\nsymptoms of ADHD, such as rapid speech, racing thoughts, distractibility, and less need\nfor sleep, overlap with the symptoms of hypomania. The double counting of symptoms to-\nward both ADHD and bipolar II disorder can be avoided if the clinician clarifies whether\nthe symptoms represent a distinct episode and if the noticeable increase over baseline re-\nquired for the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder is present. \nPersonality disorders.\nThe same convention as applies for ADHD also applies when\nevaluating an individual for a personality disorder such as borderline personality disor-\nder, since mood lability and impulsivity are common in both personality disorders and bi-\npolar II disorder. Symptoms must represent a distinct episode, and the noticeable increase\nover baseline required for the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder must be present. A diagnosis\nof a personality disorder should not be made during an untreated mood episode unless\nthe lifetime history supports the presence of a personality disorder.\nOther bipolar disorders.\nDiagnosis of bipolar II disorder should be differentiated from\nbipolar I disorder by carefully considering whether there have been any past episodes of\nmania and from other specified and unspecified bipolar and related disorders by confirm-\ning the presence of fully syndromal hypomania and depression.\nComorbidity\nBipolar II disorder is more often than not associated with one or more co-occurring mental\ndisorders, with anxiety disorders being the most common. Approximately 60% of individ-\nuals with bipolar II disorder have three or more co-occurring mental disorders; 75% have\nan anxiety disorder; and 37% have a substance use disorder. Children and adolescents\nwith bipolar II disorder have a higher rate of co-occurring anxiety disorders compared\nwith those with bipolar I disorder, and the anxiety disorder most often predates the bi-\npolar disorder. Anxiety and substance use disorders occur in individuals with bipolar II\ndisorder at a higher rate than in the general population. Approximately 14% of individuals\nwith bipolar II disorder have at least one lifetime eating disorder, with binge-eating dis-\norder being more common than bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa.\nThese commonly co-occurring disorders do not seem to follow a course of illness that\nis truly independent from that of the bipolar disorder, but rather have strong associations\nwith mood states. For example, anxiety and eating disorders tend to associate most with\ndepressive symptoms, and substance use disorders are moderately associated with manic\nsymptoms."}

The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning.\nSpecify if:\nWith anxious distress (see p. 149)\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of cyclothymic disorder is a chronic, fluctuating mood disturbance\ninvolving numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depressive symp-\ntoms that are distinct from each other (Criterion A). The hypomanic symptoms are of\ninsufficient number, severity, pervasiveness, or duration to meet full criteria for a hypo-\nmanic episode, and the depressive symptoms are of insufficient number, severity, perva-\nsiveness, or duration to meet full criteria for a major depressive episode. During the initial\n2-year period (1 year for children or adolescents), the symptoms must be persistent (pres-\nent more days than not), and any symptom-free intervals last no longer than 2 months\n(Criterion B). The diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder is made only if the criteria for a major\ndepressive, manic, or hypomanic episode have never been met (Criterion C).\nIf an individual with cyclothymic disorder subsequently (i.e., after the initial 2 years in\nadults or 1 year in children or adolescents) experiences a major depressive, manic, or hy-\npomanic episode, the diagnosis changes to major depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder,\nor other specified or unspecified bipolar and related disorder (subclassified as hypomanic\nepisode without prior major depressive episode), respectively, and the cyclothymic disor-\nder diagnosis is dropped.\nThe cyclothymic disorder diagnosis is not made if the pattern of mood swings is better\nexplained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delu-\nsional disorder, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other\npsychotic disorders (Criterion D), in which case the mood symptoms are considered asso-\nciated features of the psychotic disorder. The mood disturbance must also not be attribut-\nable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or\nanother medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism) (Criterion E). Although some individ-\nuals may function particularly well during some of the periods of hypomania, over the\nprolonged course of the disorder, there must be clinically significant distress or impair-\nment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning as a result of the\nmood disturbance (Criterion F). The impairment may develop as a result of prolonged pe-\nriods of cyclical, often unpredictable mood changes (e.g., the individual may be regarded\nas temperamental, moody, unpredictable, inconsistent, or unreliable).\nPrevalence\nThe lifetime prevalence of cyclothymic disorder is approximately 0.4%–1%. Prevalence in\nmood disorders clinics may range from 3% to 5%. In the general population, cyclothymic\ndisorder is apparently equally common in males and females. In clinical settings, females\nwith cyclothymic disorder may be more likely to present for treatment than males.\nDevelopment and Course\nCyclothymic disorder usually begins in adolescence or early adult life and is sometimes\nconsidered to reflect a temperamental predisposition to other disorders in this chapter.\nCyclothymic disorder usually has an insidious onset and a persistent course. There is a\n15%–50% risk that an individual with cyclothymic disorder will subsequently develop bi-\npolar I disorder or bipolar II disorder. Onset of persistent, fluctuating hypomanic and de-\npressive symptoms late in adult life needs to be clearly differentiated from bipolar and\nCyclothymic Disorder\n141\nrelated disorder due to another medical condition and depressive disorder due to another\nmedical condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis) before the cyclothymic disorder diagnosis is as-\nsigned. Among children with cyclothymic disorder, the mean age at onset of symptoms is\n6.5 years of age.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nGenetic and physiological.\nMajor depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder, and bipolar II\ndisorder are more common among first-degree biological relatives of individuals with cyclo-\nthymic disorder than in the general population. There may also be an increased familial risk of\nsubstance-related disorders. Cyclothymic disorder may be more common in the first-degree\nbiological relatives of individuals with bipolar I disorder than in the general population. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nBipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition and depressive disorder\ndue to another medical condition.\nThe diagnosis of bipolar and related disorder due to\nanother medical condition or depressive disorder due to another medical condition is\nmade when the mood disturbance is judged to be attributable to the physiological effect of\na specific, usually chronic medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism). This determination\nis based on the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. If it is judged that the\nhypomanic and depressive symptoms are not the physiological consequence of the med-\nical condition, then the primary mental disorder (i.e., cyclothymic disorder) and the med-\nical condition are coded. For example, this would be the case if the mood symptoms are\nconsidered to be the psychological (not the physiological) consequence of having a chronic\nmedical condition, or if there is no etiological relationship between the hypomanic and de-\npressive symptoms and the medical condition.\nSubstance\/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder and substance\/medica-\ntion-induced depressive disorder.\nSubstance\/medication-induced bipolar and related\ndisorder and substance\/medication-induced depressive disorder are distinguished from\ncyclothymic disorder by the judgment that a substance\/medication (especially stimu-\nlants) is etiologically related to the mood disturbance. The frequent mood swings in these\ndisorders that are suggestive of cyclothymic disorder usually resolve following cessation\nof substance\/medication use.\nBipolar I disorder, with rapid cycling, and bipolar II disorder, with rapid cycling.\nBoth disorders may resemble cyclothymic disorder by virtue of the frequent marked shifts\nin mood. By definition, in cyclothymic disorder the criteria for a major depressive, manic,\nor hypomanic episode has never been met, whereas the bipolar I disorder and bipolar II\ndisorder specifier “with rapid cycling” requires that full mood episodes be present. \nBorderline personality disorder.\nBorderline personality disorder is associated with\nmarked shifts in mood that may suggest cyclothymic disorder. If the criteria are met for\nboth disorders, both borderline personality disorder and cyclothymic disorder may be di-\nagnosed.\nComorbidity\nSubstance-related disorders and sleep disorders (i.e., difficulties in initiating and main-\ntaining sleep) may be present in individuals with cyclothymic disorder. Most children\nwith cyclothymic disorder treated in outpatient psychiatric settings have comorbid mental\nconditions; they are more likely than other pediatric patients with mental disorders to\nhave comorbid attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder.\n142\nBipolar and Related Disorders"}

A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predominates in the clinical picture\nand is characterized by elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, with or without depressed\nmood, or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.\nB. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both\n(1) and (2):\n1.

The involved substance\/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Crite-\nrion A.\nC. The disturbance is not better explained by a bipolar or related disorder that is not sub-\nstance\/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent bipolar or related disor-\nder could include the following:\nThe symptoms precede the onset of the substance\/medication use; the symptoms per-\nsist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute\nwithdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the existence\nof an independent non-substance\/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder\n(e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance\/medication-related episodes). \nD.

Note that the ICD-10-\nCM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for\nthe same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-\ninduced bipolar and related disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should\nrecord “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced bipolar and related dis-\norder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced bipolar and related disorder”). If a\nmoderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced bipolar\nand related disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moder-\nate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity\nof the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g.,\nafter a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the\nclinician should record only the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder.\nICD-10-CM\nICD-9-CM\nWith use \ndisorder, \nmild\nWith use \ndisorder, \nmoderate \nor severe\nWithout \nuse \ndisorder\nAlcohol\n291.89\nF10.14\nF10.24\nF10.94\nPhencyclidine\n292.84\nF16.14\nF16.24\nF16.94\nOther hallucinogen\n292.84\nF16.14\nF16.24\nF16.94\nSubstance\/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder\n143\nSpecify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders” for di-\nagnoses associated with substance class):\nWith onset during intoxication: If the criteria are met for intoxication with the sub-\nstance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.\nWith onset during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance\nand the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.\nRecording Procedures\nICD-9-CM.\nThe name of the substance\/medication-induced bipolar and related disor-\nder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to\nbe causing the bipolar mood symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table in-\ncluded in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit\ninto any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for “other substance” should be\nused; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific\nclass of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used.\nThe name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during in-\ntoxication, onset during withdrawal). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM,\nwhich combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single\ncode, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For\nexample, in the case of irritable symptoms occurring during intoxication in a man with a\nsevere cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.84 cocaine-induced bipolar and related\ndisorder, with onset during intoxication. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine\nuse disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a significant\nrole in the development of bipolar mood symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g.,\n292.84 methylphenidate-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxi-\ncation; 292.84 dexamethasone-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during in-\ntoxication).\nICD-10-CM.\nThe name of the substance\/medication-induced bipolar and related disor-\nder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to\nbe causing the bipolar mood symptoms.

For example, in the case of irritable symptoms oc-\ncurring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is\nF14.24 severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced bipolar and related disorder,\nwith onset during intoxication. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use\ndisorder is not given. If the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder occurs without\na comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no\naccompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F15.94 amphetamine-induced bipolar\nand related disorder, with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is\njudged to play a significant role in the development of bipolar mood symptoms, each\nshould be listed separately (e.g., F15.24 severe methylphenidate use disorder with meth-\nylphenidate-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication; F19.94\ndexamethasone-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication).\nDiagnostic Features\nThe diagnostic features of substance\/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder are es-\nsentially the same as those for mania, hypomania, or depression. A key exception to the diag-\nnosis of substance\/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder is the case of hypomania\nor mania that occurs after antidepressant medication use or other treatments and persists be-\nyond the physiological effects of the medication. This condition is considered an indicator of\ntrue bipolar disorder, not substance\/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder. Simi-\nlarly, individuals with apparent electroconvulsive therapy–induced manic or hypomanic ep-\nisodes that persist beyond the physiological effects of the treatment are diagnosed with\nbipolar disorder, not substance\/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder. \nSide effects of some antidepressants and other psychotropic drugs (e.g., edginess, ag-\nitation) may resemble the primary symptoms of a manic syndrome, but they are funda-\nmentally distinct from bipolar symptoms and are insufficient for the diagnosis. That is, the\ncriterion symptoms of mania\/hypomania have specificity (simple agitation is not the same\nas excess involvement in purposeful activities), and a sufficient number of symptoms\nmust be present (not just one or two symptoms) to make these diagnoses. In particular, the\nappearance of one or two nonspecific symptoms—irritability, edginess, or agitation during\nantidepressant treatment—in the absence of a full manic or hypomanic syndrome should\nnot be taken to support a diagnosis of a bipolar disorder.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nEtiology (causally related to the use of psychotropic medications or substances of abuse\nbased on best clinical evidence) is the key variable in this etiologically specified form of bi-\npolar disorder. Substances\/medications that are typically considered to be associated\nwith substance\/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder include the stimulant\nclass of drugs, as well as phencyclidine and steroids; however, a number of potential sub-\nstances continue to emerge as new compounds are synthesized (e.g., so-called bath salts).\nA history of such substance use may help increase diagnostic certainty.\nPrevalence\nThere are no epidemiological studies of substance\/medication-induced mania or bipolar\ndisorder. Each etiological substance may have its own individual risk of inducing a bipo-\nlar (manic\/hypomanic) disorder.\nDevelopment and Course\nIn phencyclidine-induced mania, the initial presentation may be one of a delirium with af-\nfective features, which then becomes an atypically appearing manic or mixed manic state.\nBipolar and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\n145\nThis condition follows the ingestion or inhalation quickly, usually within hours or, at the\nmost, a few days. In stimulant-induced manic or hypomanic states, the response is in min-\nutes to 1 hour after one or several ingestions or injections. The episode is very brief and\ntypically resolves over 1–2 days. With corticosteroids and some immunosuppressant\nmedications, the mania (or mixed or depressed state) usually follows several days of in-\ngestion, and the higher doses appear to have a much greater likelihood of producing bi-\npolar symptoms. \nDiagnostic Markers\nDetermination of the substance of use can be made through markers in the blood or urine\nto corroborate diagnosis.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nSubstance\/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder should be differentiated\nfrom other bipolar disorders, substance intoxication or substance-induced delirium, and\nmedication side effects (as noted earlier). A full manic episode that emerges during anti-\ndepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully\nsyndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for\na bipolar I diagnosis. A full hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant treat-\nment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level\nbeyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a bipolar II di-\nagnosis only if preceded by a major depressive episode.\nComorbidity\nComorbidities are those associated with the use of illicit substances (in the case of illegal\nstimulants or phencyclidine) or diversion of prescribed stimulants. Comorbidities related\nto steroid or immunosuppressant medications are those medical indications for these\npreparations. Delirium can occur before or along with manic symptoms in individuals in-\ngesting phencyclidine or those who are prescribed steroid medications or other immuno-\nsuppressant medications."}

The other medical condition should also be coded and listed separately immedi-\nately before the bipolar and related disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., 242.90\n[E05.90] hyperthyroidism; 293.83 [F06.33] bipolar disorder due to hyperthyroidism, with\nmanic features).\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential features of bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition are\npresence of a prominent and persistent period of abnormally elevated, expansive, or irri-\ntable mood and abnormally increased activity or energy predominating in the clinical pic-\nture that is attributable to another medical condition (Criterion B). In most cases the manic\nor hypomanic picture may appear during the initial presentation of the medical condition\n(i.e., within 1 month); however, there are exceptions, especially in chronic medical condi-\ntions that might worsen or relapse and herald the appearance of the manic or hypomanic\npicture. Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition would not be diag-\nnosed when the manic or hypomanic episodes definitely preceded the medical condition,\nsince the proper diagnosis would be bipolar disorder (except in the unusual circumstance\nin which all preceding manic or hypomanic episodes—or, when only one such episode has\noccurred, the preceding manic or hypomanic episode—were associated with ingestion of\na substance\/medication). The diagnosis of bipolar and related disorder due to another\nmedical condition should not be made during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The\nmanic or hypomanic episode in bipolar and related disorder due to another medical con-\ndition must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or\nother important areas of functioning to qualify for this diagnosis (Criterion E).\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nEtiology (i.e., a causal relationship to another medical condition based on best clinical ev-\nidence) is the key variable in this etiologically specified form of bipolar disorder. The list-\ning of medical conditions that are said to be able to induce mania is never complete, and\nthe clinician’s best judgment is the essence of this diagnosis. Among the best known of the\nmedical conditions that can cause a bipolar manic or hypomanic condition are Cushing’s\ndisease and multiple sclerosis, as well as stroke and traumatic brain injuries. \nDevelopment and Course \nBipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition usually has its onset acutely\nor subacutely within the first weeks or month of the onset of the associated medical con-\ndition. However, this is not always the case, as a worsening or later relapse of the associ-\nated medical condition may precede the onset of the manic or hypomanic syndrome. The\nclinician must make a clinical judgment in these situations about whether the medical con-\ndition is causative, based on temporal sequence as well as plausibility of a causal relation-\nBipolar and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\n147\nship. Finally, the condition may remit before or just after the medical condition remits,\nparticularly when treatment of the manic\/hypomanic symptoms is effective. \nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nCulture-related differences, to the extent that there is any evidence, pertain to those asso-\nciated with the medical condition (e.g., rates of multiple sclerosis and stroke vary around\nthe world based on dietary, genetic factors, and other environmental factors).\nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nGender differences pertain to those associated with the medical condition (e.g., systemic\nlupus erythematosus is more common in females; stroke is somewhat more common in\nmiddle-age males compared with females).\nDiagnostic Markers\nDiagnostic markers pertain to those associated with the medical condition (e.g., steroid\nlevels in blood or urine to help corroborate the diagnosis of Cushing’s disease, which can\nbe associated with manic or depressive syndromes; laboratory tests confirming the diag-\nnosis of multiple sclerosis).\nFunctional Consequences of Bipolar and Related \nDisorder Due to Another Medical Condition\nFunctional consequences of the bipolar symptoms may exacerbate impairments associ-\nated with the medical condition and may incur worse outcomes due to interference with\nmedical treatment. In general, it is believed, but not established, that the illness, when in-\nduced by Cushing’s disease, will not recur if the Cushing’s disease is cured or arrested.\nHowever, it is also suggested, but not established, that mood syndromes, including de-\npressive and manic\/hypomanic ones, may be episodic (i.e., recurring) with static brain in-\njuries and other central nervous system diseases.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nSymptoms of delirium, catatonia, and acute anxiety.\nIt is important to differentiate\nsymptoms of mania from excited or hypervigilant delirious symptoms; from excited cata-\ntonic symptoms; and from agitation related to acute anxiety states. \nMedication-induced depressive or manic symptoms.\nAn important differential diag-\nnostic observation is that the other medical condition may be treated with medications\n(e.g., steroids or alpha-interferon) that can induce depressive or manic symptoms. In these\ncases, clinical judgment using all of the evidence in hand is the best way to try to separate\nthe most likely and\/or the most important of two etiological factors (i.e., association with\nthe medical condition vs. a substance\/medication-induced syndrome). The differential di-\nagnosis of the associated medical conditions is relevant but largely beyond the scope of the\npresent manual. \nComorbidity\nConditions comorbid with bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition\nare those associated with the medical conditions of etiological relevance. Delirium can oc-\ncur before or along with manic symptoms in individuals with Cushing’s disease.\n148\nBipolar and Related Disorders"}

Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from the\nperson’s usual behavior.\nC. For individuals whose symptoms meet full episode criteria for both mania and\ndepression simultaneously, the diagnosis should be manic episode, with mixed\nfeatures, due to the marked impairment and clinical severity of full mania.\nD. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a sub-\nstance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment).\nDepressive episode, with mixed features: \nA. Full criteria are met for a major depressive episode, and at least three of the fol-\nlowing manic\/hypomanic symptoms are present during the majority of days of\nthe current or most recent episode of depression:\n1.

These episodes can\noccur in any combination and order. The episodes must meet both the duration and\nSpecifiers for Bipolar and Related Disorders\n151\nsymptom number criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode and\nmust be demarcated by either a period of full remission or a switch to an episode\nof the opposite polarity. Manic and hypomanic episodes are counted as being on\nthe same pole. Except for the fact that they occur more frequently, the episodes that\noccur in a rapid-cycling pattern are no different from those that occur in a non-rapid-\ncycling pattern. Mood episodes that count toward defining a rapid-cycling pattern\nexclude those episodes directly caused by a substance (e.g., cocaine, corticoste-\nroids) or another medical condition.\nWith melancholic features:\nA. One of the following is present during the most severe period of the current episode:\n1. Loss of pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.\n2. Lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli (does not feel much better, even\ntemporarily, when something good happens).\nB. Three (or more) of the following:\n1. A distinct quality of depressed mood characterized by profound despondency,\ndespair, and\/or moroseness or by so-called empty mood.\n2. Depression that is regularly worse in the morning.\n3. Early-morning awakening (i.e., at least 2 hours before usual awakening).\n4. Marked psychomotor agitation or retardation.\n5. Significant anorexia or weight loss.\n6. Excessive or inappropriate guilt.\nNote: The specifier “with melancholic features” is applied if these features are pres-\nent at the most severe stage of the episode. There is a near-complete absence of\nthe capacity for pleasure, not merely a diminution. A guideline for evaluating the\nlack of reactivity of mood is that even highly desired events are not associated with\nmarked brightening of mood. Either mood does not brighten at all, or it brightens\nonly partially (e.g., up to 20%–40% of normal for only minutes at a time). The “dis-\ntinct quality” of mood that is characteristic of the “with melancholic features” speci-\nfier is experienced as qualitatively different from that during a nonmelancholic\ndepressive episode. A depressed mood that is described as merely more severe,\nlonger lasting, or present without a reason is not considered distinct in quality. Psy-\nchomotor changes are nearly always present and are observable by others.\nMelancholic features exhibit only a modest tendency to repeat across episodes\nin the same individual. They are more frequent in inpatients, as opposed to outpa-\ntients; are less likely to occur in milder than in more severe major depressive epi-\nsodes; and are more likely to occur in those with psychotic features.\nWith atypical features: This specifier can be applied when these features predomi-\nnate during the majority of days of the current or most recent major depressive epi-\nsode. \nA. Mood reactivity (i.e., mood brightens in response to actual or potential positive\nevents).\nB. Two (or more) of the following features: \n1. Significant weight gain or increase in appetite.\n2. Hypersomnia.\n3. Leaden paralysis (i.e., heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs).\n4. A long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity (not limited to epi-\nsodes of mood disturbance) that results in significant social or occupational\nimpairment.\n152\nBipolar and Related Disorders\nC. Criteria are not met for “with melancholic features” or “with catatonia” during the\nsame episode.\nNote: “Atypical depression” has historical significance (i.e., atypical in contradis-\ntinction to the more classical agitated, “endogenous” presentations of depression\nthat were the norm when depression was rarely diagnosed in outpatients and al-\nmost never in adolescents or younger adults) and today does not connote an un-\ncommon or unusual clinical presentation as the term might imply.\nMood reactivity is the capacity to be cheered up when presented with positive\nevents (e.g., a visit from children, compliments from others). Mood may become\neuthymic (not sad) even for extended periods of time if the external circumstances\nremain favorable. Increased appetite may be manifested by an obvious increase in\nfood intake or by weight gain. Hypersomnia may include either an extended period\nof nighttime sleep or daytime napping that totals at least 10 hours of sleep per day\n(or at least 2 hours more than when not depressed). Leaden paralysis is defined as\nfeeling heavy, leaden, or weighted down, usually in the arms or legs. This sensation\nis generally present for at least an hour a day but often lasts for many hours at a\ntime. Unlike the other atypical features, pathological sensitivity to perceived inter-\npersonal rejection is a trait that has an early onset and persists throughout most of\nadult life. Rejection sensitivity occurs both when the person is and is not depressed,\nthough it may be exacerbated during depressive periods.\nWith psychotic features: Delusions or hallucinations are present at any time in the\nepisode. If psychotic features are present, specify if mood-congruent or mood-incon-\ngruent:\nWith mood-congruent psychotic features: During manic episodes, the con-\ntent of all delusions and hallucinations is consistent with the typical manic\nthemes of grandiosity, invulnerability, etc., but may also include themes of sus-\npiciousness or paranoia, especially with respect to others’ doubts about the in-\ndividual’s capacities, accomplishments, and so forth.\nWith mood-incongruent psychotic features: The content of delusions and\nhallucinations is inconsistent with the episode polarity themes as described\nabove, or the content is a mixture of mood-incongruent and mood-congruent\nthemes.\nWith catatonia: This specifier can apply to an episode of mania or depression if cata-\ntonic features are present during most of the episode. See criteria for catatonia asso-\nciated with a mental disorder in the chapter “Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other\nPsychotic Disorders.”\nWith peripartum onset: This specifier can be applied to the current or, if the full crite-\nria are not currently met for a mood episode, most recent episode of mania, hypoma-\nnia, or major depression in bipolar I or bipolar II disorder if onset of mood symptoms\noccurs during pregnancy or in the 4 weeks following delivery.\nNote: Mood episodes can have their onset either during pregnancy or postpartum.\nAlthough the estimates differ according to the period of follow-up after delivery, be-\ntween 3% and 6% of women will experience the onset of a major depressive epi-\nsode during pregnancy or in the weeks or months following delivery. Fifty percent\nof “postpartum” major depressive episodes actually begin prior to delivery. Thus,\nthese episodes are referred to collectively as peripartum episodes. Women with\nperipartum major depressive episodes often have severe anxiety and even panic\nattacks. Prospective studies have demonstrated that mood and anxiety symptoms\nduring pregnancy, as well as the “baby blues,” increase the risk for a postpartum\nmajor depressive episode.\nSpecifiers for Bipolar and Related Disorders\n153\nPeripartum-onset mood episodes can present either with or without psychotic\nfeatures. Infanticide is most often associated with postpartum psychotic episodes\nthat are characterized by command hallucinations to kill the infant or delusions that\nthe infant is possessed, but psychotic symptoms can also occur in severe postpar-\ntum mood episodes without such specific delusions or hallucinations.\nPostpartum mood (major depressive or manic) episodes with psychotic features\nappear to occur in from 1 in 500 to 1 in 1,000 deliveries and may be more common\nin primiparous women. The risk of postpartum episodes with psychotic features is\nparticularly increased for women with prior postpartum mood episodes but is also\nelevated for those with a prior history of a depressive or bipolar disorder (especially\nbipolar I disorder) and those with a family history of bipolar disorders.\nOnce a woman has had a postpartum episode with psychotic features, the risk\nof recurrence with each subsequent delivery is between 30% and 50%. Postpartum\nepisodes must be differentiated from delirium occurring in the postpartum period,\nwhich is distinguished by a fluctuating level of awareness or attention. The postpar-\ntum period is unique with respect to the degree of neuroendocrine alterations and\npsychosocial adjustments, the potential impact of breast-feeding on treatment plan-\nning, and the long-term implications of a history of postpartum mood disorder on sub-\nsequent family planning.\nWith seasonal pattern: This specifier applies to the lifetime pattern of mood episodes.\nThe essential feature is a regular seasonal pattern of at least one type of episode (i.e.,\nmania, hypomania, or depression). The other types of episodes may not follow this pat-\ntern. For example, an individual may have seasonal manias, but his or her depressions\ndo not regularly occur at a specific time of year.\nA. There has been a regular temporal relationship between the onset of manic, hypo-\nmanic, or major depressive episodes and a particular time of the year (e.g., in the\nfall or winter) in bipolar I or bipolar II disorder.\nNote: Do not include cases in which there is an obvious effect of seasonally related\npsychosocial stressors (e.g., regularly being unemployed every winter). \nB. Full remissions (or a change from major depression to mania or hypomania or vice\nversa) also occur at a characteristic time of the year (e.g., depression disappears\nin the spring).\nC. In the last 2 years, the individual’s manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episodes\nhave demonstrated a temporal seasonal relationship, as defined above, and no\nnon-seasonal episodes of that polarity have occurred during that 2-year period.\nD. Seasonal manias, hypomanias, or depressions (as described above) substantially\noutnumber any nonseasonal manias, hypomanias, or depressions that may have\noccurred over the individual’s lifetime.\nNote: This specifier can be applied to the pattern of major depressive episodes in\nbipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, or major depressive disorder, recurrent. The\nessential feature is the onset and remission of major depressive episodes at char-\nacteristic times of the year. In most cases, the episodes begin in fall or winter and\nremit in spring. Less commonly, there may be recurrent summer depressive epi-\nsodes. This pattern of onset and remission of episodes must have occurred during\nat least a 2-year period, without any nonseasonal episodes occurring during this\nperiod. In addition, the seasonal depressive episodes must substantially outnum-\nber any nonseasonal depressive episodes over the individual’s lifetime.\nThis specifier does not apply to those situations in which the pattern is better ex-\nplained by seasonally linked psychosocial stressors (e.g., seasonal unemployment\nor school schedule). Major depressive episodes that occur in a seasonal pattern\n154\nBipolar and Related Disorders\nare often characterized by prominent energy, hypersomnia, overeating, weight\ngain, and a craving for carbohydrates. It is unclear whether a seasonal pattern is\nmore likely in recurrent major depressive disorder or in bipolar disorders. However,\nwithin the bipolar disorders group, a seasonal pattern appears to be more likely in\nbipolar II disorder than in bipolar I disorder. In some individuals, the onset of manic\nor hypomanic episodes may also be linked to a particular season.\nThe prevalence of winter-type seasonal pattern appears to vary with latitude,\nage, and sex. Prevalence increases with higher latitudes. Age is also a strong pre-\ndictor of seasonality, with younger persons at higher risk for winter depressive epi-\nsodes.\nSpecify if:\nIn partial remission: Symptoms of the immediately previous manic, hypomanic, or\ndepressive episode are present, but full criteria are not met, or there is a period lasting\nless than 2 months without any significant symptoms of a manic, hypomanic, or major\ndepressive episode following the end of such an episode.\nIn full remission: During the past 2 months, no significant signs or symptoms of the\ndisturbance were present.\nSpecify current severity: \nSeverity is based on the number of criterion symptoms, the severity of those symptoms,\nand the degree of functional disability.\nMild: Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to meet the diagnostic criteria\nare present, the intensity of the symptoms is distressing but manageable, and the\nsymptoms result in minor impairment in social or occupational functioning.\nModerate: The number of symptoms, intensity of symptoms, and\/or functional impair-\nment are between those specified for “mild” and “severe.”\nSevere: The number of symptoms is substantially in excess of those required to make\nthe diagnosis, the intensity of the symptoms is seriously distressing and unmanage-\nable, and the symptoms markedly interfere with social and occupational functioning.\n155"}
