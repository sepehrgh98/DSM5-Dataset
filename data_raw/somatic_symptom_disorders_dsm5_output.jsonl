One or more somatic symptoms that are distressing or result in significant disruption\nof daily life. \nB. Excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or associ-\nated health concerns as manifested by at least one of the following: \n1. Disproportionate and persistent thoughts about the seriousness of one’s symptoms.\n2. Persistently high level of anxiety about health or symptoms.\n3. Excessive time and energy devoted to these symptoms or health concerns.\nC. Although any one somatic symptom may not be continuously present, the state of be-\ning symptomatic is persistent (typically more than 6 months). \nSpecify if:\nWith predominant pain (previously pain disorder): This specifier is for individuals\nwhose somatic symptoms predominantly involve pain.\nSpecify if:\nPersistent: A persistent course is characterized by severe symptoms, marked impair-\nment, and long duration (more than 6 months).\nSpecify current severity: \nMild: Only one of the symptoms specified in Criterion B is fulfilled.\nModerate: Two or more of the symptoms specified in Criterion B are fulfilled.\nSevere: Two or more of the symptoms specified in Criterion B are fulfilled, plus there\nare multiple somatic complaints (or one very severe somatic symptom).\nDiagnostic Features\nIndividuals with somatic symptom disorder typically have multiple, current, somatic symp-\ntoms that are distressing or result in significant disruption of daily life (Criterion A), al-\nthough sometimes only one severe symptom, most commonly pain, is present. Symptoms\nmay be specific (e.g., localized pain) or relatively nonspecific (e.g., fatigue). The symptoms\nsometimes represent normal bodily sensations or discomfort that does not generally sig-\nnify serious disease. Somatic symptoms without an evident medical explanation are not\nsufficient to make this diagnosis. The individual’s suffering is authentic, whether or not it\nis medically explained.\nThe symptoms may or may not be associated with another medical condition. The di-\nagnoses of somatic symptom disorder and a concurrent medical illness are not mutually\nexclusive, and these frequently occur together. For example, an individual may become se-\nriously disabled by symptoms of somatic symptom disorder after an uncomplicated myo-\ncardial infarction even if the myocardial infarction itself did not result in any disability. If\nanother medical condition or high risk for developing one is present (e.g., strong family\nhistory), the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors associated with this condition are excessive\n(Criterion B).\nIndividuals with somatic symptom disorder tend to have very high levels of worry\nabout illness (Criterion B). They appraise their bodily symptoms as unduly threatening,\nharmful, or troublesome and often think the worst about their health. Even when there is\nevidence to the contrary, some patients still fear the medical seriousness of their symp-\ntoms. In severe somatic symptom disorder, health concerns may assume a central role in\nthe individual’s life, becoming a feature of his or her identity and dominating interper-\nsonal relationships.\n312\nSomatic Symptom and Related Disorders\nIndividuals typically experience distress that is principally focused on somatic symp-\ntoms and their significance. When asked directly about their distress, some individuals de-\nscribe it in relation to other aspects of their lives, while others deny any source of distress\nother than the somatic symptoms. Health-related quality of life is often impaired, both\nphysically and mentally. In severe somatic symptom disorder, the impairment is marked,\nand when persistent, the disorder can lead to invalidism.\nThere is often a high level of medical care utilization, which rarely alleviates the individ-\nual’s concerns. Consequently, the patient may seek care from multiple doctors for the same\nsymptoms. These individuals often seem unresponsive to medical interventions, and new\ninterventions may only exacerbate the presenting symptoms. Some individuals with the dis-\norder seem unusually sensitive to medication side effects. Some feel that their medical as-\nsessment and treatment have been inadequate. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nCognitive features include attention focused on somatic symptoms, attribution of normal\nbodily sensations to physical illness (possibly with catastrophic interpretations), worry\nabout illness, and fear that any physical activity may damage the body. The relevant as-\nsociated behavioral features may include repeated bodily checking for abnormalities, re-\npeated seeking of medical help and reassurance, and avoidance of physical activity. These\nbehavioral features are most pronounced in severe, persistent somatic symptom disorder.\nThese features are usually associated with frequent requests for medical help for different\nsomatic symptoms. This may lead to medical consultations in which individuals are so fo-\ncused on their concerns about somatic symptom(s) that they cannot be redirected to other\nmatters. Any reassurance by the doctor that the symptoms are not indicative of serious\nphysical illness tends to be short-lived and\/or is experienced by the individuals as the\ndoctor not taking their symptoms with due seriousness. As the focus on somatic symp-\ntoms is a primary feature of the disorder, individuals with somatic symptom disorder typ-\nically present to general medical health services rather than mental health services. The\nsuggestion of referral to a mental health specialist may be met with surprise or even frank\nrefusal by individuals with somatic symptom disorder.\nSince somatic symptom disorder is associated with depressive disorders, there is an in-\ncreased suicide risk. It is not known whether somatic symptom disorder is associated with\nsuicide risk independent of its association with depressive disorders.\nPrevalence \nThe prevalence of somatic symptom disorder is not known. However, the prevalence of\nsomatic symptom disorder is expected to be higher than that of the more restrictive DSM-\nIV somatization disorder (<1%) but lower than that of undifferentiated somatoform dis-\norder (approximately 19%). The prevalence of somatic symptom disorder in the general\nadult population may be around 5%–7%. Females tend to report more somatic symptoms\nthan do males, and the prevalence of somatic symptom disorder is consequently likely to\nbe higher in females.\nDevelopment and Course\nIn older individuals, somatic symptoms and concurrent medical illnesses are common,\nand a focus on Criterion B is crucial for making the diagnosis. Somatic symptom disorder\nmay be underdiagnosed in older adults either because certain somatic symptoms (e.g.,\npain, fatigue) are considered part of normal aging or because illness worry is considered\n“understandable” in older adults who have more general medical illnesses and medica-\ntions than do younger people. Concurrent depressive disorder is common in older people\nwho present with numerous somatic symptoms.\nSomatic Symptom Disorder\n313\nIn children, the most common symptoms are recurrent abdominal pain, headache, fa-\ntigue, and nausea. A single prominent symptom is more common in children than in\nadults. While young children may have somatic complaints, they rarely worry about “ill-\nness” per se prior to adolescence. The parents’ response to the symptom is important, as\nthis may determine the level of associated distress. It is the parent who may determine the\ninterpretation of symptoms and the associated time off school and medical help seeking. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nTemperamental.\nThe personality trait of negative affectivity (neuroticism) has been identi-\nfied as an independent correlate\/risk factor of a high number of somatic symptoms. Comorbid\nanxiety or depression is common and may exacerbate symptoms and impairment.\nEnvironmental.\nSomatic symptom disorder is more frequent in individuals with few years\nof education and low socioeconomic status, and in those who have recently experienced\nstressful life events. \nCourse modifiers.\nPersistent somatic symptoms are associated with demographic fea-\ntures (female sex, older age, fewer years of education, lower socioeconomic status, un-\nemployment), a reported history of sexual abuse or other childhood adversity, concurrent\nchronic physical illness or psychiatric disorder (depression, anxiety, persistent depressive\ndisorder [dysthymia], panic), social stress, and reinforcing social factors such as illness\nbenefits. Cognitive factors that affect clinical course include sensitization to pain, height-\nened attention to bodily sensations, and attribution of bodily symptoms to a possible med-\nical illness rather than recognizing them as a normal phenomenon or psychological stress. \nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nSomatic symptoms are prominent in various “culture-bound syndromes.” High numbers\nof somatic symptoms are found in population-based and primary care studies around the\nworld, with a similar pattern of the most commonly reported somatic symptoms, impair-\nment, and treatment seeking. The relationship between number of somatic symptoms and\nillness worry is similar in different cultures, and marked illness worry is associated with\nimpairment and greater treatment seeking across cultures. The relationship between nu-\nmerous somatic symptoms and depression appears to be very similar around the world\nand between different cultures within one country.\nDespite these similarities, there are differences in somatic symptoms among cultures\nand ethnic groups. The description of somatic symptoms varies with linguistic and other\nlocal cultural factors. These somatic presentations have been described as “idioms of dis-\ntress” because somatic symptoms may have special meanings and shape patient-clinician\ninteractions in the particular cultural contexts. “Burnout,” the sensation of heaviness or\nthe complaints of “gas”; too much heat in the body; or burning in the head are examples of\nsymptoms that are common in some cultures or ethnic groups but rare in others. Explan-\natory models also vary, and somatic symptoms may be attributed variously to particular\nfamily, work, or environmental stresses; general medical illness; the suppression of feel-\nings of anger and resentment; or certain culture-specific phenomena, such as semen loss.\nThere may also be differences in medical treatment seeking among cultural groups, in ad-\ndition to differences due to variable access to medical care services. Seeking treatment for\nmultiple somatic symptoms in general medical clinics is a worldwide phenomenon and\noccurs at similar rates among ethnic groups in the same country.\nFunctional Consequences of Somatic Symptom Disorder\nThe disorder is associated with marked impairment of health status. Many individuals\nwith severe somatic symptom disorder are likely to have impaired health status scores\nmore than 2 standard deviations below population norms. \n314\nSomatic Symptom and Related Disorders\nDifferential Diagnosis\nIf the somatic symptoms are consistent with another mental disorder (e.g., panic disorder),\nand the diagnostic criteria for that disorder are fulfilled, then that mental disorder should\nbe considered as an alternative or additional diagnosis. A separate diagnosis of somatic\nsymptom disorder is not made if the somatic symptoms and related thoughts, feelings, or\nbehaviors occur only during major depressive episodes. If, as commonly occurs, the crite-\nria for both somatic symptom disorder and another mental disorder diagnosis are ful-\nfilled, then both should be coded, as both may require treatment. \nOther medical conditions.\nThe presence of somatic symptoms of unclear etiology is not\nin itself sufficient to make the diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder. The symptoms of\nmany individuals with disorders like irritable bowel syndrome or fibromyalgia would not\nsatisfy the criterion necessary to diagnose somatic symptom disorder (Criterion B). Con-\nversely, the presence of somatic symptoms of an established medical disorder (e.g., diabe-\ntes or heart disease) does not exclude the diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder if the\ncriteria are otherwise met.\nPanic disorder.\nIn panic disorder, somatic symptoms and anxiety about health tend to\noccur in acute episodes, whereas in somatic symptom disorder, anxiety and somatic symp-\ntoms are more persistent.\nGeneralized anxiety disorder.\nIndividuals with generalized anxiety disorder worry about\nmultiple events, situations, or activities, only one of which may involve their health. The\nmain focus is not usually somatic symptoms or fear of illness as it is in somatic symptom\ndisorder.\nDepressive disorders.\nDepressive disorders are commonly accompanied by somatic\nsymptoms. However, depressive disorders are differentiated from somatic symptom dis-\norder by the core depressive symptoms of low (dysphoric) mood and anhedonia. \nIllness anxiety disorder.\nIf the individual has extensive worries about health but no or\nminimal somatic symptoms, it may be more appropriate to consider illness anxiety disorder.\nConversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).\nIn conversion disor-\nder, the presenting symptom is loss of function (e.g., of a limb), whereas in somatic symp-\ntom disorder, the focus is on the distress that particular symptoms cause. The features\nlisted under Criterion B of somatic symptom disorder may be helpful in differentiating the\ntwo disorders.\nDelusional disorder.\nIn somatic symptom disorder, the individual’s beliefs that somatic\nsymptoms might reflect serious underlying physical illness are not held with delusional\nintensity. Nonetheless, the individual’s beliefs concerning the somatic symptoms can be\nfirmly held. In contrast, in delusional disorder, somatic subtype, the somatic symptom be-\nliefs and behavior are stronger than those found in somatic symptom disorder. \nBody dysmorphic disorder.\nIn body dysmorphic disorder, the individual is excessively\nconcerned about, and preoccupied by, a perceived defect in his or her physical features. In\ncontrast, in somatic symptom disorder, the concern about somatic symptoms reflects fear\nof underlying illness, not of a defect in appearance.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nIn somatic symptom disorder, the recurrent ideas about\nsomatic symptoms or illness are less intrusive, and individuals with this disorder do not\nexhibit the associated repetitive behaviors aimed at reducing anxiety that occur in obses-\nsive-compulsive disorder.\nComorbidity\nSomatic symptom disorder is associated with high rates of comorbidity with medical dis-\norders as well as anxiety and depressive disorders. When a concurrent medical illness is\nIllness Anxiety Disorder\n315\npresent, the degree of impairment is more marked than would be expected from the phys-\nical illness alone. When an individual’s symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for somatic\nsymptom disorder, the disorder should be diagnosed; however, in view of the frequent co-\nmorbidity, especially with anxiety and depressive disorders, evidence for these concur-\nrent diagnoses should be sought."}

Preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness. \nB. Somatic symptoms are not present or, if present, are only mild in intensity. If another\nmedical condition is present or there is a high risk for developing a medical condition\n(e.g., strong family history is present), the preoccupation is clearly excessive or dispro-\nportionate. \nC. There is a high level of anxiety about health, and the individual is easily alarmed about\npersonal health status.\nD. The individual performs excessive health-related behaviors (e.g., repeatedly checks\nhis or her body for signs of illness) or exhibits maladaptive avoidance (e.g., avoids doc-\ntor appointments and hospitals).\nE. Illness preoccupation has been present for at least 6 months, but the specific illness\nthat is feared may change over that period of time.\nF. The illness-related preoccupation is not better explained by another mental disorder, such\nas somatic symptom disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, body dysmor-\nphic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or delusional disorder, somatic type.\nSpecify whether:\nCare-seeking type: Medical care, including physician visits or undergoing tests and\nprocedures, is frequently used.\nCare-avoidant type: Medical care is rarely used.\nDiagnostic Features\nMost individuals with hypochondriasis are now classified as having somatic symptom\ndisorder; however, in a minority of cases, the diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder applies\ninstead. Illness anxiety disorder entails a preoccupation with having or acquiring a seri-\nous, undiagnosed medical illness (Criterion A). Somatic symptoms are not present or, if\npresent, are only mild in intensity (Criterion B). A thorough evaluation fails to identify a\nserious medical condition that accounts for the individual’s concerns. While the concern\nmay be derived from a nonpathological physical sign or sensation, the individual’s dis-\ntress emanates not primarily from the physical complaint itself but rather from his or her\nanxiety about the meaning, significance, or cause of the complaint (i.e., the suspected med-\nical diagnosis). If a physical sign or symptom is present, it is often a normal physiological\nsensation (e.g., orthostatic dizziness), a benign and self-limited dysfunction (e.g., transient\ntinnitus), or a bodily discomfort not generally considered indicative of disease (e.g., belch-\ning). If a diagnosable medical condition is present, the individual’s anxiety and preoccu-\npation are clearly excessive and disproportionate to the severity of the condition (Criterion\nB). Empirical evidence and existing literature pertain to previously defined DSM hypo-\nchondriasis, and it is unclear to what extent and how precisely they apply to the descrip-\ntion of this new diagnosis.\nThe preoccupation with the idea that one is sick is accompanied by substantial anxiety\nabout health and disease (Criterion C). Individuals with illness anxiety disorder are easily\n316\nSomatic Symptom and Related Disorders\nalarmed about illness, such as by hearing about someone else falling ill or reading a health-\nrelated news story. Their concerns about undiagnosed disease do not respond to appro-\npriate medical reassurance, negative diagnostic tests, or benign course. The physician’s at-\ntempts at reassurance and symptom palliation generally do not alleviate the individual’s\nconcerns and may heighten them. Illness concerns assume a prominent place in the indi-\nvidual’s life, affecting daily activities, and may even result in invalidism. Illness becomes\na central feature of the individual’s identity and self-image, a frequent topic of social dis-\ncourse, and a characteristic response to stressful life events. Individuals with the disorder\noften examine themselves repeatedly (e.g., examining one’s throat in the mirror) (Crite-\nrion D). They research their suspected disease excessively (e.g., on the Internet) and re-\npeatedly seek reassurance from family, friends, or physicians. This incessant worrying often\nbecomes frustrating for others and may result in considerable strain within the family. In\nsome cases, the anxiety leads to maladaptive avoidance of situations (e.g., visiting sick\nfamily members) or activities (e.g., exercise) that these individuals fear might jeopardize\ntheir health.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nBecause they believe they are medically ill, individuals with illness anxiety disorder are\nencountered far more frequently in medical than in mental health settings. The majority of\nindividuals with illness anxiety disorder have extensive yet unsatisfactory medical care,\nthough some may be too anxious to seek medical attention. They generally have elevated\nrates of medical utilization but do not utilize mental health services more than the general\npopulation. They often consult multiple physicians for the same problem and obtain re-\npeatedly negative diagnostic test results. At times, medical attention leads to a paradoxical\nexacerbation of anxiety or to iatrogenic complications from diagnostic tests and proce-\ndures. Individuals with the disorder are generally dissatisfied with their medical care and\nfind it unhelpful, often feeling they are not being taken seriously by physicians. At times,\nthese concerns may be justified, since physicians sometimes are dismissive or respond\nwith frustration or hostility. This response can occasionally result in a failure to diagnose\na medical condition that is present.\nPrevalence\nPrevalence estimates of illness anxiety disorder are based on estimates of the DSM-III and\nDSM-IV diagnosis hypochondriasis. The 1- to 2-year prevalence of health anxiety and\/or\ndisease conviction in community surveys and population-based samples ranges from 1.3%\nto 10%. In ambulatory medical populations, the 6-month\/1-year prevalence rates are be-\ntween 3% and 8%. The prevalence of the disorder is similar in males and females.\nDevelopment and Course \nThe development and course of illness anxiety disorder are unclear. Illness anxiety disor-\nder is generally thought to be a chronic and relapsing condition with an age at onset in\nearly and middle adulthood. In population-based samples, health-related anxiety in-\ncreases with age, but the ages of individuals with high health anxiety in medical settings\ndo not appear to differ from those of other patients in those settings. In older individuals,\nhealth-related anxiety often focuses on memory loss; the disorder is thought to be rare in\nchildren.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nEnvironmental.\nIllness anxiety disorder may sometimes be precipitated by a major life\nstress or a serious but ultimately benign threat to the individual’s health. A history of child-\nIllness Anxiety Disorder\n317\nhood abuse or of a serious childhood illness may predispose to development of the disor-\nder in adulthood. \nCourse modifiers.\nApproximately one-third to one-half of individuals with illness anx-\niety disorder have a transient form, which is associated with less psychiatric comorbidity,\nmore medical comorbidity, and less severe illness anxiety disorder. \nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues \nThe diagnosis should be made with caution in individuals whose ideas about disease are\ncongruent with widely held, culturally sanctioned beliefs. Little is known about the phe-\nnomenology of the disorder across cultures, although the prevalence appears to be similar\nacross different countries with diverse cultures.\nFunctional Consequences of Illness Anxiety Disorder\nIllness anxiety disorder causes substantial role impairment and decrements in physical\nfunction and health-related quality of life. Health concerns often interfere with interper-\nsonal relationships, disrupt family life, and damage occupational performance. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther medical conditions.\nThe first differential diagnostic consideration is an underly-\ning medical condition, including neurological or endocrine conditions, occult malignan-\ncies, and other diseases that affect multiple body systems. The presence of a medical\ncondition does not rule out the possibility of coexisting illness anxiety disorder. If a med-\nical condition is present, the health-related anxiety and disease concerns are clearly dis-\nproportionate to its seriousness. Transient preoccupations related to a medical condition\ndo not constitute illness anxiety disorder. \nAdjustment disorders.\nHealth-related anxiety is a normal response to serious illness\nand is not a mental disorder. Such nonpathological health anxiety is clearly related to the\nmedical condition and is typically time-limited. If the health anxiety is severe enough, an\nadjustment disorder may be diagnosed. However, only when the health anxiety is of suf-\nficient duration, severity, and distress can illness anxiety disorder be diagnosed. Thus, the\ndiagnosis requires the continuous persistence of disproportionate health-related anxiety\nfor at least 6 months. \nSomatic symptom disorder.\nSomatic symptom disorder is diagnosed when significant\nsomatic symptoms are present. In contrast, individuals with illness anxiety disorder have\nminimal somatic symptoms and are primarily concerned with the idea they are ill. \nAnxiety disorders.\nIn generalized anxiety disorder, individuals worry about multiple\nevents, situations, or activities, only one of which may involve health. In panic disorder,\nthe individual may be concerned that the panic attacks reflect the presence of a medical ill-\nness; however, although these individuals may have health anxiety, their anxiety is typi-\ncally very acute and episodic. In illness anxiety disorder, the health anxiety and fears are\nmore persistent and enduring. Individuals with illness anxiety disorder may experience\npanic attacks that are triggered by their illness concerns. \nObsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nIndividuals with illness anxiety disor-\nder may have intrusive thoughts about having a disease and also may have associated\ncompulsive behaviors (e.g., seeking reassurance). However, in illness anxiety disorder, the\npreoccupations are usually focused on having a disease, whereas in obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder (OCD), the thoughts are intrusive and are usually focused on fears of getting a\ndisease in the future. Most individuals with OCD have obsessions or compulsions involv-\ning other concerns in addition to fears about contracting disease. In body dysmorphic dis-\n318\nSomatic Symptom and Related Disorders\norder, concerns are limited to the individual’s physical appearance, which is viewed as\ndefective or flawed.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nSome individuals with a major depressive episode rumi-\nnate about their health and worry excessively about illness. A separate diagnosis of illness\nanxiety disorder is not made if these concerns occur only during major depressive epi-\nsodes. However, if excessive illness worry persists after remission of an episode of major\ndepressive disorder, the diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder should be considered. \nPsychotic disorders.\nIndividuals with illness anxiety disorder are not delusional and\ncan acknowledge the possibility that the feared disease is not present. Their ideas do not\nattain the rigidity and intensity seen in the somatic delusions occurring in psychotic dis-\norders (e.g., schizophrenia; delusional disorder, somatic type; major depressive disorder,\nwith psychotic features). True somatic delusions are generally more bizarre (e.g., that an\norgan is rotting or dead) than the concerns seen in illness anxiety disorder. The concerns\nseen in illness anxiety disorder, though not founded in reality, are plausible. \nComorbidity\nBecause illness anxiety disorder is a new disorder, exact comorbidities are unknown. Hy-\npochondriasis co-occurs with anxiety disorders (in particular, generalized anxiety disor-\nder, panic disorder, and OCD) and depressive disorders. Approximately two-thirds of\nindividuals with illness anxiety disorder are likely to have at least one other comorbid ma-\njor mental disorder. Individuals with illness anxiety disorder may have an elevated risk\nfor somatic symptom disorder and personality disorders."}

One or more symptoms of altered voluntary motor or sensory function.\nB.

The symptom or deficit is not better explained by another medical or mental disorder.\nD. The symptom or deficit causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-\ncupational, or other important areas of functioning or warrants medical evaluation.\nCoding note: The ICD-9-CM code for conversion disorder is 300.11, which is assigned\nregardless of the symptom type. The ICD-10-CM code depends on the symptom type (see\nbelow).\nSpecify symptom type:\n(F44.4) With weakness or paralysis\n(F44.4) With abnormal movement (e.g., tremor, dystonic movement, myoclonus, gait\ndisorder)\n(F44.4) With swallowing symptoms\n(F44.4) With speech symptom (e.g., dysphonia, slurred speech)\n(F44.5) With attacks or seizures\n(F44.6) With anesthesia or sensory loss\n(F44.6) With special sensory symptom (e.g., visual, olfactory, or hearing distur-\nbance)\n(F44.7) With mixed symptoms\nConversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder)\n319\nSpecify if:\nAcute episode: Symptoms present for less than 6 months.\nPersistent: Symptoms occurring for 6 months or more.\nSpecify if:\nWith psychological stressor (specify stressor)\nWithout psychological stressor\nDiagnostic Features\nMany clinicians use the alternative names of “functional” (referring to abnormal central\nnervous system functioning) or “psychogenic” (referring to an assumed etiology) to de-\nscribe the symptoms of conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disor-\nder). In conversion disorder, there may be one or more symptoms of various types. Motor\nsymptoms include weakness or paralysis; abnormal movements, such as tremor or dys-\ntonic movements; gait abnormalities; and abnormal limb posturing. Sensory symptoms\ninclude altered, reduced, or absent skin sensation, vision, or hearing. Episodes of abnor-\nmal generalized limb shaking with apparent impaired or loss of consciousness may resem-\nble epileptic seizures (also called psychogenic or non-epileptic seizures). There may be\nepisodes of unresponsiveness resembling syncope or coma. Other symptoms include re-\nduced or absent speech volume (dysphonia\/aphonia), altered articulation (dysarthria), a\nsensation of a lump in the throat (globus), and diplopia. \nAlthough the diagnosis requires that the symptom is not explained by neurological\ndisease, it should not be made simply because results from investigations are normal or\nbecause the symptom is “bizarre.” There must be clinical findings that show clear evidence\nof incompatibility with neurological disease. Internal inconsistency at examination is one\nway to demonstrate incompatibility (i.e., demonstrating that physical signs elicited\nthrough one examination method are no longer positive when tested a different way). Ex-\namples of such examination findings include\n• Hoover’s sign, in which weakness of hip extension returns to normal strength with con-\ntralateral hip flexion against resistance.\n• Marked weakness of ankle plantar-flexion when tested on the bed in an individual who\nis able to walk on tiptoes;\n• Positive findings on the tremor entrainment test. On this test, a unilateral tremor may\nbe identified as functional if the tremor changes when the individual is distracted away\nfrom it. This may be observed if the individual is asked to copy the examiner in making\na rhythmical movement with their unaffected hand and this causes the functional\ntremor to change such that it copies or “entrains” to the rhythm of the unaffected hand\nor the functional tremor is suppressed, or no longer makes a simple rhythmical move-\nment.\n• In attacks resembling epilepsy or syncope (“psychogenic” non-epileptic attacks), the\noccurrence of closed eyes with resistance to opening or a normal simultaneous electro-\nencephalogram (although this alone does not exclude all forms of epilepsy or syncope).\n• For visual symptoms, a tubular visual field (i.e., tunnel vision).\nIt is important to note that the diagnosis of conversion disorder should be based on the\noverall clinical picture and not on a single clinical finding.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nA number of associated features can support the diagnosis of conversion disorder. There\nmay be a history of multiple similar somatic symptoms. Onset may be associated with\nstress or trauma, either psychological or physical in nature. The potential etiological rele-\n320\nSomatic Symptom and Related Disorders\nvance of this stress or trauma may be suggested by a close temporal relationship. However,\nwhile assessment for stress and trauma is important, the diagnosis should not be withheld\nif none is found.\nConversion disorder is often associated with dissociative symptoms, such as deperson-\nalization, derealization, and dissociative amnesia, particularly at symptom onset or during\nattacks.\nThe diagnosis of conversion disorder does not require the judgment that the symptoms\nare not intentionally produced (i.e., not feigned), as the definite absence of feigning may\nnot be reliably discerned. The phenomenon of la belle indifférence (i.e., lack of concern about\nthe nature or implications of the symptom) has been associated with conversion disorder\nbut it is not specific for conversion disorder and should not be used to make the diagnosis.\nSimilarly the concept of secondary gain (i.e., when individuals derive external benefits such\nas money or release from responsibilities) is also not specific to conversion disorder and\nparticularly in the context of definite evidence for feigning, the diagnoses that should be\nconsidered instead would include factitious disorder or malingering (see the section “Dif-\nferential Diagnosis” for this disorder).\nPrevalence\nTransient conversion symptoms are common, but the precise prevalence of the disorder is\nunknown. This is partly because the diagnosis usually requires assessment in secondary\ncare, where it is found in approximately 5% of referrals to neurology clinics. The incidence\nof individual persistent conversion symptoms is estimated to be 2–5\/100,000 per year.\nDevelopment and Course\nOnset has been reported throughout the life course. The onset of non-epileptic attacks\npeaks in the third decade, and motor symptoms have their peak onset in the fourth decade.\nThe symptoms can be transient or persistent. The prognosis may be better in younger chil-\ndren than in adolescents and adults.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nTemperamental.\nMaladaptive personality traits are commonly associated with conver-\nsion disorder.\nEnvironmental.\nThere may be a history of childhood abuse and neglect. Stressful life\nevents are often, but not always, present. \nGenetic and physiological.\nThe presence of neurological disease that causes similar symp-\ntoms is a risk factor (e.g., non-epileptic seizures are more common in patients who also\nhave epilepsy).\nCourse modifiers.\nShort duration of symptoms and acceptance of the diagnosis are pos-\nitive prognostic factors. Maladaptive personality traits, the presence of comorbid physical\ndisease, and the receipt of disability benefits may be negative prognostic factors.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nChanges resembling conversion (and dissociative) symptoms are common in certain\nculturally sanctioned rituals. If the symptoms are fully explained within the particular\ncultural context and do not result in clinically significant distress or disability, then the di-\nagnosis of conversion disorder is not made. \nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nConversion disorder is two to three times more common in females. \nConversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder)\n321\nFunctional Consequences of Conversion Disorder\nIndividuals with conversion symptoms may have substantial disability. The severity of dis-\nability can be similar to that experienced by individuals with comparable medical diseases. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nIf another mental disorder better explains the symptoms, that diagnosis should be made.\nHowever the diagnosis of conversion disorder may be made in the presence of another\nmental disorder. \nNeurological disease.\nThe main differential diagnosis is neurological disease that might\nbetter explain the symptoms. After a thorough neurological assessment, an unexpected\nneurological disease cause for the symptoms is rarely found at follow up. However, reas-\nsessment may be required if the symptoms appear to be progressive. Conversion disorder\nmay coexist with neurological disease.\nSomatic symptom disorder.\nConversion disorder may be diagnosed in addition to so-\nmatic symptom disorder. Most of the somatic symptoms encountered in somatic symptom\ndisorder cannot be demonstrated to be clearly incompatible with pathophysiology (e.g.,\npain, fatigue), whereas in conversion disorder, such incompatibility is required for the di-\nagnosis. The excessive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors characterizing somatic symptom\ndisorder are often absent in conversion disorder.\nFactitious disorder and malingering.\nThe diagnosis of conversion disorder does not re-\nquire the judgment that the symptoms are not intentionally produced (i.e., not feigned),\nbecause assessment of conscious intention is unreliable. However definite evidence of\nfeigning (e.g., clear evidence that loss of function is present during the examination but not\nat home) would suggest a diagnosis of factitious disorder if the individual’s apparent aim\nis to assume the sick role or malingering if the aim is to obtain an incentive such as money.\nDissociative disorders.\nDissociative symptoms are common in individuals with con-\nversion disorder. If both conversion disorder and a dissociative disorder are present, both\ndiagnoses should be made. \nBody dysmorphic disorder.\nIndividuals with body dysmorphic disorder are exces-\nsively concerned about a perceived defect in their physical features but do not complain of\nsymptoms of sensory or motor functioning in the affected body part. \nDepressive disorders.\nIn depressive disorders, individuals may report general heavi-\nness of their limbs, whereas the weakness of conversion disorder is more focal and prom-\ninent. Depressive disorders are also differentiated by the presence of core depressive\nsymptoms. \nPanic disorder.\nEpisodic neurological symptoms (e.g., tremors and paresthesias) can\noccur in both conversion disorder and panic attacks. In panic attacks, the neurological\nsymptoms are typically transient and acutely episodic with characteristic cardiorespira-\ntory symptoms. Loss of awareness with amnesia for the attack and violent limb move-\nments occur in non-epileptic attacks, but not in panic attacks. \nComorbidity\nAnxiety disorders, especially panic disorder, and depressive disorders commonly co-occur\nwith conversion disorder. Somatic symptom disorder may co-occur as well. Psychosis, sub-\nstance use disorder, and alcohol misuse are uncommon. Personality disorders are more\ncommon in individuals with conversion disorder than in the general population. Neuro-\nlogical or other medical conditions commonly coexist with conversion disorder as well.\n322\nSomatic Symptom and Related Disorders"}

A medical symptom or condition (other than a mental disorder) is present. \nB. Psychological or behavioral factors adversely affect the medical condition in one of the\nfollowing ways: \n1. The factors have influenced the course of the medical condition as shown by a\nclose temporal association between the psychological factors and the development\nor exacerbation of, or delayed recovery from, the medical condition.\n2. The factors interfere with the treatment of the medical condition (e.g., poor adher-\nence).\n3. The factors constitute additional well-established health risks for the individual.\n4. The factors influence the underlying pathophysiology, precipitating or exacerbating\nsymptoms or necessitating medical attention.\nC. The psychological and behavioral factors in Criterion B are not better explained by an-\nother mental disorder (e.g., panic disorder, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic\nstress disorder).\nSpecify current severity:\nMild: Increases medical risk (e.g., inconsistent adherence with antihypertension treat-\nment). \nModerate: Aggravates underlying medical condition (e.g., anxiety aggravating\nasthma).\nSevere: Results in medical hospitalization or emergency room visit.\nExtreme: Results in severe, life-threatening risk (e.g., ignoring heart attack symp-\ntoms).\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of psychological factors affecting other medical conditions is the\npresence of one or more clinically significant psychological or behavioral factors that ad-\nversely affect a medical condition by increasing the risk for suffering, death, or disability\n(Criterion B). These factors can adversely affect the medical condition by influencing its\ncourse or treatment, by constituting an additional well-established health risk factor, or by\ninfluencing the underlying pathophysiology to precipitate or exacerbate symptoms or to\nnecessitate medical attention. \nPsychological or behavioral factors include psychological distress, patterns of interper-\nsonal interaction, coping styles, and maladaptive health behaviors, such as denial of symp-\ntoms or poor adherence to medical recommendations. Common clinical examples are\nanxiety-exacerbating asthma, denial of need for treatment for acute chest pain, and manip-\nulation of insulin by an individual with diabetes wishing to lose weight. Many different\npsychological factors have been demonstrated to adversely influence medical conditions—\nfor example, symptoms of depression or anxiety, stressful life events, relationship style,\npersonality traits, and coping styles. The adverse effects can range from acute, with imme-\ndiate medical consequences (e.g., Takotsubo cardiomyopathy) to chronic, occurring over a\nlong period of time (e.g., chronic occupational stress increasing risk for hypertension). Af-\nfected medical conditions can be those with clear pathophysiology (e.g., diabetes, cancer,\ncoronary disease), functional syndromes (e.g., migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, fibro-\nmyalgia), or idiopathic medical symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue, dizziness). \nPsychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions\n323\nThis diagnosis should be reserved for situations in which the effect of the psychological\nfactor on the medical condition is evident and the psychological factor has clinically sig-\nnificant effects on the course or outcome of the medical condition. Abnormal psychologi-\ncal or behavioral symptoms that develop in response to a medical condition are more\nproperly coded as an adjustment disorder (a clinically significant psychological response\nto an identifiable stressor). There must be reasonable evidence to suggest an association\nbetween the psychological factors and the medical condition, although it may often not be\npossible to demonstrate direct causality or the mechanisms underlying the relationship.\nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of psychological factors affecting other medical conditions is unclear. In\nU.S. private insurance billing data, it is a more common diagnosis than somatic symptom\ndisorders.\nDevelopment and Course\nPsychological factors affecting other medical conditions can occur across the lifespan. Par-\nticularly with young children, corroborative history from parents or school can assist the di-\nagnostic evaluation. Some conditions are characteristic of particular life stages (e.g., in older\nindividuals, the stress associated with acting as a caregiver for an ill spouse or partner).\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nMany differences between cultures may influence psychological factors and their effects\non medical conditions, such as those in language and communication style, explanatory\nmodels of illness, patterns of seeking health care, service availability and organization,\ndoctor-patient relationships and other healing practices, family and gender roles, and at-\ntitudes toward pain and death. Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions\nmust be differentiated from culturally specific behaviors such as using faith or spiritual\nhealers or other variations in illness management that are acceptable within a culture and\nrepresent an attempt to help the medical condition rather than interfere with it. These local\npractices may complement rather than obstruct evidence-based interventions. If they do\nnot adversely affect outcomes, they should not be pathologized as psychological factors\naffecting other medical conditions.\nFunctional Consequences of Psychological Factors \nAffecting Other Medical Conditions\nPsychological and behavioral factors have been demonstrated to affect the course of many\nmedical diseases.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nMental disorder due to another medical condition.\nA temporal association between\nsymptoms of a mental disorder and those of a medical condition is also characteristic of a\nmental disorder due to another medical condition, but the presumed causality is in the op-\nposite direction. In a mental disorder due to another medical condition, the medical\ncondition is judged to be causing the mental disorder through a direct physiological mech-\nanism. In psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, the psychological or be-\nhavioral factors are judged to affect the course of the medical condition.\nAdjustment disorders.\nAbnormal psychological or behavioral symptoms that develop in\nresponse to a medical condition are more properly coded as an adjustment disorder (a clin-\nically significant psychological response to an identifiable stressor). For example, an indi-\n324\nSomatic Symptom and Related Disorders\nvidual with angina that is precipitated whenever he becomes enraged would be diagnosed\nas having psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, whereas an individual\nwith angina who developed maladaptive anticipatory anxiety would be diagnosed as hav-\ning an adjustment disorder with anxiety. In clinical practice, however, psychological fac-\ntors and a medical condition are often mutually exacerbating (e.g., anxiety as both a\nprecipitant and a consequence of angina), in which case the distinction is arbitrary. Other\nmental disorders frequently result in medical complications, most notably substance use\ndisorders (e.g., alcohol use disorder, tobacco use disorder). If an individual has a coexisting\nmajor mental disorder that adversely affects or causes another medical condition, diagno-\nses of the mental disorder and the medical condition are usually sufficient. Psychological\nfactors affecting other medical conditions is diagnosed when the psychological traits or\nbehaviors do not meet criteria for a mental diagnosis. \nSomatic symptom disorder.\nSomatic symptom disorder is characterized by a combina-\ntion of distressing somatic symptoms and excessive or maladaptive thoughts, feelings,\nand behavior in response to these symptoms or associated health concerns. The individual\nmay or may not have a diagnosable medical condition. In contrast, in psychological factors\naffecting other medical conditions, the psychological factors adversely affect a medical\ncondition; the individual’s thoughts, feelings, and behavior are not necessarily excessive.\nThe difference is one of emphasis, rather than a clear-cut distinction. In psychological fac-\ntors affecting other medical conditions, the emphasis is on the exacerbation of the medical\ncondition (e.g., an individual with angina that is precipitated whenever he becomes anx-\nious). In somatic symptom disorder, the emphasis is on maladaptive thoughts, feelings,\nand behavior (e.g., an individual with angina who worries constantly that she will have a\nheart attack, takes her blood pressure multiple times per day, and restricts her activities).\nIllness anxiety disorder.\nIllness anxiety disorder is characterized by high illness anxiety\nthat is distressing and\/or disruptive to daily life with minimal somatic symptoms. The fo-\ncus of clinical concern is the individual’s worry about having a disease; in most cases, no\nserious disease is present. In psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, anx-\niety may be a relevant psychological factor affecting a medical condition, but the clinical\nconcern is the adverse effects on the medical condition.\nComorbidity\nBy definition, the diagnosis of psychological factors affecting other medical conditions entails\na relevant psychological or behavioral syndrome or trait and a comorbid medical condition."}

The perpetrator, not the victim, is given the diag-\nnosis. The victim may be given an abuse diagnosis (e.g., 995.54 [T74.12X]; see the chapter\n“Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention”). \nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of factitious disorder is the falsification of medical or psychological signs\nand symptoms in oneself or others that are associated with the identified deception. Indi-\nviduals with factitious disorder can also seek treatment for themselves or another following\ninduction of injury or disease. The diagnosis requires demonstrating that the individual is\ntaking surreptitious actions to misrepresent, simulate, or cause signs or symptoms of ill-\nness or injury in the absence of obvious external rewards. Methods of illness falsification\ncan include exaggeration, fabrication, simulation, and induction. While a preexisting med-\nical condition may be present, the deceptive behavior or induction of injury associated\nwith deception causes others to view such individuals (or another) as more ill or impaired,\nand this can lead to excessive clinical intervention. Individuals with factitious disorder\nmight, for example, report feelings of depression and suicidality following the death of a\nspouse despite the death not being true or the individual’s not having a spouse; decep-\ntively report episodes of neurological symptoms (e.g., seizures, dizziness, or blacking out);\nmanipulate a laboratory test (e.g., by adding blood to urine) to falsely indicate an abnor-\nmality; falsify medical records to indicate an illness; ingest a substance (e.g., insulin or\nwarfarin) to induce an abnormal laboratory result or illness; or physically injure them-\nselves or induce illness in themselves or another (e.g., by injecting fecal material to produce\nan abscess or to induce sepsis).\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with factitious disorder imposed on self or factitious disorder imposed on an-\nother are at risk for experiencing great psychological distress or functional impairment by\ncausing harm to themselves and others. Family, friends, and health care professionals are\nalso often adversely affected by their behavior. Factitious disorders have similarities to\nsubstance use disorders, eating disorders, impulse-control disorders, pedophilic disorder,\nand some other established disorders related to both the persistence of the behavior and\nthe intentional efforts to conceal the disordered behavior through deception. Whereas\nsome aspects of factitious disorders might represent criminal behavior (e.g., factitious dis-\n326\nSomatic Symptom and Related Disorders\norder imposed on another, in which the parent’s actions represent abuse and maltreat-\nment of a child), such criminal behavior and mental illness are not mutually exclusive. The\ndiagnosis of factitious disorder emphasizes the objective identification of falsification of\nsigns and symptoms of illness, rather than an inference about intent or possible underly-\ning motivation. Moreover, such behaviors, including the induction of injury or disease, are\nassociated with deception. \nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of factitious disorder is unknown, likely because of the role of deception in\nthis population. Among patients in hospital settings, it is estimated that about 1% of indi-\nviduals have presentations that meet the criteria for factitious disorder.\nDevelopment and Course\nThe course of factitious disorder is usually one of intermittent episodes. Single episodes\nand episodes that are characterized as persistent and unremitting are both less common.\nOnset is usually in early adulthood, often after hospitalization for a medical condition or a\nmental disorder. When imposed on another, the disorder may begin after hospitalization\nof the individual’s child or other dependent. In individuals with recurrent episodes of fal-\nsification of signs and symptoms of illness and\/or induction of injury, this pattern of suc-\ncessive deceptive contact with medical personnel, including hospitalizations, may become\nlifelong. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nCaregivers who lie about abuse injuries in dependents solely to protect themselves from lia-\nbility are not diagnosed with factitious disorder imposed on another because protection from\nliability is an external reward (Criterion C, the deceptive behavior is evident even in the ab-\nsence of obvious external rewards). Such caregivers who, upon observation, analysis of med-\nical records, and\/or interviews with others, are found to lie more extensively than needed for\nimmediate self-protection are diagnosed with factitious disorder imposed on another.\nSomatic symptom disorder.\nIn somatic symptom disorder, there may be excessive at-\ntention and treatment seeking for perceived medical concerns, but there is no evidence that\nthe individual is providing false information or behaving deceptively. \nMalingering.\nMalingering is differentiated from factitious disorder by the intentional re-\nporting of symptoms for personal gain (e.g., money, time off work). In contrast, the diag-\nnosis of factitious disorder requires the absence of obvious rewards. \nConversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).\nConversion disorder\nis characterized by neurological symptoms that are inconsistent with neurological patho-\nphysiology. Factitious disorder with neurological symptoms is distinguished from con-\nversion disorder by evidence of deceptive falsification of symptoms. \nBorderline personality disorder.\nDeliberate physical self-harm in the absence of suicidal\nintent can also occur in association with other mental disorders such as borderline person-\nality disorder. Factitious disorder requires that the induction of injury occur in association\nwith deception. \nMedical condition or mental disorder not associated with intentional symptom falsifi-\ncation.\nPresentation of signs and symptoms of illness that do not conform to an identi-\nfiable medical condition or mental disorder increases the likelihood of the presence of a\nfactitious disorder. However, the diagnosis of factitious disorder does not exclude the\npresence of true medical condition or mental disorder, as comorbid illness often occurs in\nthe individual along with factitious disorder. For example, individuals who might manip-\nulate blood sugar levels to produce symptoms may also have diabetes.\nOther Specified Somatic Symptom and Related Disorder\n327"}
