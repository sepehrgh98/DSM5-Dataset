The diurnal-only subtype occurs in the\nabsence of nocturnal enuresis and may be referred to simply as urinary incontinence. Indi-\nviduals with this subtype can be divided into two groups. Individuals with “urge incon-\ntinence” have sudden urge symptoms and detrusor instability, whereas individuals with\n“voiding postponement” consciously defer micturition urges until incontinence results.\nThe nocturnal-and-diurnal subtype is also known as nonmonosymptomatic enuresis.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of enuresis is repeated voiding of urine during the day or at night into\nbed or clothes (Criterion A). Most often the voiding is involuntary, but occasionally it may\n356\nElimination Disorders\nbe intentional. To qualify for a diagnosis of enuresis, the voiding of urine must occur at\nleast twice a week for at least 3 consecutive months or must cause clinically significant dis-\ntress or impairment in social, academic (occupational), or other important areas of func-\ntioning (Criterion B). The individual must have reached an age at which continence is\nexpected (i.e., a chronological age of at least 5 years or, for children with developmental\ndelays, a mental age of at least 5 years) (Criterion C). The urinary incontinence is not at-\ntributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a diuretic, an antipsychotic med-\nication) or another medical condition (e.g., diabetes, spina bifida, a seizure disorder)\n(Criterion D).\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nDuring nocturnal enuresis, occasionally the voiding takes place during rapid eye movement\n(REM) sleep, and the child may recall a dream that involved the act of urinating. During day-\ntime (diurnal) enuresis, the child defers voiding until incontinence occurs, sometimes because\nof a reluctance to use the toilet as a result of social anxiety or a preoccupation with school or\nplay activity. The enuretic event most commonly occurs in the early afternoon on school days\nand may be associated with symptoms of disruptive behavior. The enuresis commonly per-\nsists after appropriate treatment of an associated infection. \nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of enuresis is 5%–10% among 5-year-olds, 3%–5% among 10-year-olds,\nand around 1% among individuals 15 years or older.\nDevelopment and Course\nTwo types of course of enuresis have been described: a “primary” type, in which the indi-\nvidual has never established urinary continence, and a “secondary” type, in which the dis-\nturbance develops after a period of established urinary continence. There are no differences\nin prevalence of comorbid mental disorders between the two types. By definition, primary\nenuresis begins at age 5 years. The most common time for the onset of secondary enuresis\nis between ages 5 and 8 years, but it may occur at any time. After age 5 years, the rate of spon-\ntaneous remission is 5%–10% per year. Most children with the disorder become continent\nby adolescence, but in approximately 1% of cases the disorder continues into adulthood.\nDiurnal enuresis is uncommon after age 9 years. While occasional diurnal incontinence is\nnot uncommon in middle childhood, it is substantially more common in those who also\nhave persistent nocturnal enuresis. When enuresis persists into late childhood or adoles-\ncence, the frequency of incontinence may increase, whereas continence in early childhood\nis usually associated with a declining frequency of wet nights.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nEnvironmental.\nA number of predisposing factors for enuresis have been suggested, in-\ncluding delayed or lax toilet training and psychosocial stress.\nGenetic and physiological.\nEnuresis has been associated with delays in the develop-\nment of normal circadian rhythms of urine production, with resulting nocturnal polyuria\nor abnormalities of central vasopressin receptor sensitivity, and reduced functional blad-\nder capacities with bladder hyperreactivity (unstable bladder syndrome). Nocturnal en-\nuresis is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. Heritability has been shown in family, twin,\nand segregation analyses. Risk for childhood nocturnal enuresis is approximately 3.6 times\nhigher in offspring of enuretic mothers and 10.1 times higher in the presence of paternal\nurinary incontinence. The risk magnitudes for nocturnal enuresis and diurnal incontinence\nare similar.\nEncopresis\n357\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues \nEnuresis has been reported in a variety of European, African, and Asian countries as well\nas in the United States. At a national level, prevalence rates are remarkably similar, and\nthere is great similarity in the developmental trajectories found in different countries.\nThere are very high rates of enuresis in orphanages and other residential institutions,\nlikely related to the mode and environment in which toilet training occurs. \nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nNocturnal enuresis is more common in males. Diurnal incontinence is more common in fe-\nmales. The relative risk of having a child who develops enuresis is greater for previously\nenuretic fathers than for previously enuretic mothers. \nFunctional Consequences of Enuresis\nThe amount of impairment associated with enuresis is a function of the limitation on the\nchild’s social activities (e.g., ineligibility for sleep-away camp) or its effect on the child’s\nself-esteem, the degree of social ostracism by peers, and the anger, punishment, and rejec-\ntion on the part of caregivers.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nNeurogenic bladder or another medical condition.\nThe diagnosis of enuresis is not made\nin the presence of a neurogenic bladder or another medical condition that causes polyuria or\nurgency (e.g., untreated diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus) or during an acute urinary\ntract infection. However, a diagnosis is compatible with such conditions if urinary inconti-\nnence was regularly present prior to the development of another medical condition or if it per-\nsists after the institution of appropriate treatment of the medical condition.\nMedication side effects.\nEnuresis may occur during treatment with antipsychotic med-\nications, diuretics, or other medications that may induce incontinence. In this case, the di-\nagnosis should not be made in isolation but may be noted as a medication side effect.\nHowever, a diagnosis of enuresis may be made if urinary incontinence was regularly pres-\nent prior to treatment with the medication.\nComorbidity\nAlthough most children with enuresis do not have a comorbid mental disorder, the prevalence\nof comorbid behavioral symptoms is higher in children with enuresis than in children without\nenuresis. Developmental delays, including speech, language, learning, and motor skills\ndelays, are also present in a portion of children with enuresis. Encopresis, sleepwalking, and\nsleep terror disorder may be present. Urinary tract infections are more common in children\nwith enuresis, especially the diurnal subtype, than in those who are continent."}

Repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places (e.g., clothing, floor), whether in-\nvoluntary or intentional.\nB. At least one such event occurs each month for at least 3 months.\nC. Chronological age is at least 4 years (or equivalent developmental level).\nD. The behavior is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., laxa-\ntives) or another medical condition except through a mechanism involving constipation.\n358\nElimination Disorders\nSpecify whether:\nWith constipation and overflow incontinence: There is evidence of constipation on\nphysical examination or by history.\nWithout constipation and overflow incontinence: There is no evidence of constipa-\ntion on physical examination or by history.\nSubtypes\nFeces in the with constipation and overflow incontinence subtype are characteristically\n(but not invariably) poorly formed, and leakage can be infrequent to continuous, occur-\nring mostly during the day and rarely during sleep. Only part of the feces is passed during\ntoileting, and the incontinence resolves after treatment of the constipation.\nIn the without constipation and overflow incontinence subtype, feces are likely to be of\nnormal form and consistency, and soiling is intermittent. Feces may be deposited in a\nprominent location. This is usually associated with the presence of oppositional defiant\ndisorder or conduct disorder or may be the consequence of anal masturbation. Soiling\nwithout constipation appears to be less common than soiling with constipation.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of encopresis is repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places (e.g.,\nclothing or floor) (Criterion A). Most often the passage is involuntary but occasionally may be\nintentional. The event must occur at least once a month for at least 3 months (Criterion B), and\nthe chronological age of the child must be at least 4 years (or for children with developmental\ndelays, the mental age must be at least 4 years) (Criterion C). The fecal incontinence must not\nbe exclusively attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., laxatives) or another\nmedical condition except through a mechanism involving constipation (Criterion D).\nWhen the passage of feces is involuntary rather than intentional, it is often related to\nconstipation, impaction, and retention with subsequent overflow. The constipation may\ndevelop for psychological reasons (e.g., anxiety about defecating in a particular place, a\nmore general pattern of anxious or oppositional behavior), leading to avoidance of defeca-\ntion. Physiological predispositions to constipation include ineffectual straining or paradox-\nical defecation dynamics, with contraction rather than relaxation of the external sphincter\nor pelvic floor during straining for defecation. Dehydration associated with a febrile ill-\nness, hypothyroidism, or a medication side effect can also induce constipation. Once con-\nstipation has developed, it may be complicated by an anal fissure, painful defecation, and\nfurther fecal retention. The consistency of the stool may vary. In some individuals the stool\nmay be of normal or near-normal consistency. In other individuals—such as those with\noverflow incontinence secondary to fecal retention—it may be liquid.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nThe child with encopresis often feels ashamed and may wish to avoid situations (e.g.,\ncamp, school) that might lead to embarrassment. The amount of impairment is a function\nof the effect on the child's self-esteem, the degree of social ostracism by peers, and the an-\nger, punishment, and rejection on the part of caregivers. Smearing feces may be deliberate\nor accidental, resulting from the child’s attempt to clean or hide feces that were passed in-\nvoluntarily. When the incontinence is clearly deliberate, features of oppositional defiant\ndisorder or conduct disorder may also be present. Many children with encopresis and\nchronic constipation also have enuresis symptoms and may have associated urinary reflux\nin the bladder or ureters that may lead to chronic urinary infections, the symptoms of\nwhich may remit with treatment of the constipation."}

Inadequate,\ninconsistent toilet training and psychosocial stress (e.g., entering school, the birth of a sib-\nling) may be predisposing factors. Two types of course have been described: a “primary”\ntype, in which the individual has never established fecal continence, and a “secondary”\ntype, in which the disturbance develops after a period of established fecal continence. En-\ncopresis can persist, with intermittent exacerbations, for years.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nGenetic and physiological.\nPainful defecation can lead to constipation and a cycle of with-\nholding behaviors that make encopresis more likely. Use of some medications (e.g., anti-\nconvulsants, cough suppressants) may increase constipation and make encopresis more\nlikely.\nDiagnostic Markers\nIn addition to physical examination, gastrointestinal imaging (e.g., abdominal radiograph)\nmay be informative to assess retained stool and gas in the colon. Additional tests, such as\nbarium enema and anorectal manography, may be used to help exclude other medical\nconditions, such as Hirschsprung’s disease.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nA diagnosis of encopresis in the presence of another medical condition is appropriate only\nif the mechanism involves constipation that cannot be explained by other medical condi-\ntions.
