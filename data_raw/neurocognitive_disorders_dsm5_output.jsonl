Table 1 pro-\nvides for each of the key domains a working definition, examples of symptoms or obser-\nvations regarding impairments in everyday activities, and examples of assessments. The\ndomains thus defined, along with guidelines for clinical thresholds, form the basis on\nwhich the NCDs, their levels, and their subtypes may be diagnosed.\nNeurocognitive Disorders\n593\nTABLE 1 Neurocognitive domains\nCognitive domain\nExamples of symptoms or observations\nExamples of assessments \nComplex attention \n(sustained attention, \ndivided attention, \nselective attention, \nprocessing speed)\nMajor: Has increased difficulty in environments with multiple \nstimuli (TV, radio, conversation); is easily distracted by compet-\ning events in the environment. Is unable to attend unless input is \nrestricted and simplified. Has difficulty holding new information \nin mind, such as recalling phone numbers or addresses just given, \nor reporting what was just said. Is unable to perform mental cal-\nculations. All thinking takes longer than usual, and components \nto be processed must be simplified to one or a few.\nMild: Normal tasks take longer than previously. Begins to find \nerrors in routine tasks; finds work needs more double-checking \nthan previously. Thinking is easier when not competing with \nother things (radio, TV, other conversations, cell phone, driving).\nSustained attention: Maintenance of attention over time (e.g., pressing \na button every time a tone is heard, and over a period of time). \nSelective attention: Maintenance of attention despite competing stim-\nuli and\/or distractors: hearing numbers and letters read and asked \nto count only letters.\nDivided attention: Attending to two tasks within the same time \nperiod: rapidly tapping while learning a story being read. Process-\ning speed can be quantified on any task by timing it (e.g., time to \nput together a design of blocks; time to match symbols with num-\nbers; speed in responding, such as counting speed or serial 3 \nspeed). \nExecutive function \n(planning, decision \nmaking, working \nmemory, respond-\ning to feedback\/\nerror correction, \noverriding habits\/\ninhibition, mental \nflexibility)\nMajor: Abandons complex projects. Needs to focus on one task \nat a time. Needs to rely on others to plan instrumental activi-\nties of daily living or make decisions. \nMild: Increased effort required to complete multistage projects. \nHas increased difficulty multitasking or difficulty resuming a \ntask interrupted by a visitor or phone call. May complain of \nincreased fatigue from the extra effort required to organize, \nplan, and make decisions. May report that large social gather-\nings are more taxing or less enjoyable because of increased \neffort required to follow shifting conversations.\nPlanning: Ability to find the exit to a maze; interpret a sequential pic-\nture or object arrangement.\nDecision making: Performance of tasks that assess process of deciding \nin the face of competing alternatives (e.g., simulated gambling).\nWorking memory: Ability to hold information for a brief period and to \nmanipulate it (e.g., adding up a list of numbers or repeating a series \nof numbers or words backward).\nFeedback\/error utilization: Ability to benefit from feedback to infer the \nrules for solving a problem.\nOverriding habits\/inhibition: Ability to choose a more complex and \neffortful solution to be correct (e.g., looking away from the direc-\ntion indicated by an arrow; naming the color of a word’s font rather \nthan naming the word).\nMental\/cognitive flexibility: Ability to shift between two concepts, \ntasks, or response rules (e.g., from number to letter, from verbal to \nkey-press response, from adding numbers to ordering numbers, \nfrom ordering objects by size to ordering by color).\n594\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nLearning and mem-\nory (immediate \nmemory, recent \nmemory [including \nfree recall, cued \nrecall, and recogni-\ntion memory], \nvery-long-term \nmemory [semantic; \nautobiographical], \nimplicit learning) \nMajor: Repeats self in conversation, often within the same con-\nversation. Cannot keep track of short list of items when shop-\nping or of plans for the day. Requires frequent reminders to \norient to task at hand.\nMild: Has difficulty recalling recent events, and relies increas-\ningly on list making or calendar. Needs occasional reminders \nor re-reading to keep track of characters in a movie or novel. \nOccasionally may repeat self over a few weeks to the same per-\nson. Loses track of whether bills have already been paid.\nNote: Except in severe forms of major neurocognitive disorder, \nsemantic, autobiographical, and implicit memory are rela-\ntively preserved, compared with recent memory. \nImmediate memory span: Ability to repeat a list of words or digits. \nNote: Immediate memory sometimes subsumed under “working \nmemory” (see “Executive Function”).\nRecent memory: Assesses the process of encoding new information \n(e.g., word lists, a short story, or diagrams). The aspects of recent \nmemory that can be tested include 1) free recall (the person is asked \nto recall as many words, diagrams, or elements of a story as possi-\nble); 2) cued recall (examiner aids recall by providing semantic cues \nsuch as “List all the food items on the list” or “Name all of the chil-\ndren from the story”); and 3) recognition memory (examiner asks \nabout specific items—e.g., “Was ’apple’ on the list?”  or “Did you \nsee this diagram or figure?”). Other aspects of memory that can be \nassessed include semantic memory (memory for facts), autobio-\ngraphical memory (memory for personal events or people), and \nimplicit (procedural) learning (unconscious learning of skills).\nLanguage (expres-\nsive language \n[including nam-\ning, word finding, \nfluency, and gram-\nmar, and syntax] \nand receptive \nlanguage)\nMajor: Has significant difficulties with expressive or receptive \nlanguage. Often uses general-use phrases such as “that thing” \nand “you know what I mean,” and prefers general pronouns \nrather than names. With severe impairment, may not even \nrecall names of closer friends and family. Idiosyncratic word \nusage, grammatical errors, and spontaneity of output and \neconomy of utterances occur. Stereotypy of speech occurs; \necholalia and automatic speech typically precede mutism.\nMild: Has noticeable word-finding difficulty. May substitute \ngeneral for specific terms. May avoid use of specific names of \nacquaintances. Grammatical errors involve subtle omission or \nincorrect use of articles, prepositions, auxiliary verbs, etc. \nExpressive language: Confrontational naming (identification of objects \nor pictures); fluency (e.g., name as many items as possible in a \nsemantic [e.g., animals] or phonemic [e.g., words starting with “f”] \ncategory in 1 minute).\nGrammar and syntax (e.g., omission or incorrect use of articles, prep-\nositions, auxiliary verbs): Errors observed during naming and flu-\nency tests are compared with norms to assess frequency of errors \nand compare with normal slips of the tongue.\nReceptive language: Comprehension (word definition and object-\npointing tasks involving animate and inanimate stimuli): perfor-\nmance of actions\/activities according to verbal command.\nTABLE 1 Neurocognitive domains (continued)\nCognitive domain\nExamples of symptoms or observations\nExamples of assessments \nNeurocognitive Disorders\n595\nPerceptual-motor \n(includes abilities \nsubsumed under \nthe terms visual \nperception, visuo-\nconstructional, \nperceptual-motor, \npraxis, and gnosis) \nMajor: Has significant difficulties with previously familiar activ-\nities (using tools, driving motor vehicle), navigating in familiar \nenvironments; is often more confused at dusk, when shadows \nand lowering levels of light change perceptions. \nMild: May need to rely more on maps or others for directions. \nUses notes and follows others to get to a new place. May find \nself lost or turned around when not concentrating on task. Is \nless precise in parking. Needs to expend greater effort for spa-\ntial tasks such as carpentry, assembly, sewing, or knitting.\nVisual perception: Line bisection tasks can be used to detect basic \nvisual defect or attentional neglect. Motor-free perceptual tasks \n(including facial recognition) require the identification and\/or \nmatching of figures—best when tasks cannot be verbally mediated \n(e.g., figures are not objects); some require the decision of whether \na figure can be “real” or not based on dimensionality.  \nVisuoconstructional: Assembly of items requiring hand-eye coordina-\ntion, such as drawing, copying, and block assembly. \nPerceptual-motor: Integrating perception with purposeful movement \n(e.g., inserting blocks into a form board without visual cues; rap-\nidly inserting pegs into a slotted board).\nPraxis: Integrity of learned movements, such as ability to imitate \ngestures (wave goodbye) or pantomime use of objects to command \n(“Show me how you would use a hammer”).\nGnosis: Perceptual integrity of awareness and recognition, such as \nrecognition of faces and colors.\nSocial cognition \n(recognition of \nemotions, theory \nof mind)\nMajor: Behavior clearly out of acceptable social range; shows \ninsensitivity to social standards of modesty in dress or of polit-\nical, religious, or sexual topics of conversation. Focuses exces-\nsively on a topic despite group’s disinterest or direct feedback. \nBehavioral intention without regard to family or friends. \nMakes decisions without regard to safety (e.g., inappropriate \nclothing for weather or social setting). Typically, has little \ninsight into these changes.\nMild: Has subtle changes in behavior or attitude, often described \nas a change in personality, such as less ability to recognize \nsocial cues or read facial expressions, decreased empathy, \nincreased extraversion or introversion, decreased inhibition, \nor subtle or episodic apathy or restlessness.\nRecognition of emotions: Identification of emotion in images of faces \nrepresenting a variety of both positive and negative emotions.\nTheory of mind: Ability to consider another person’s mental state \n(thoughts, desires, intentions) or experience—story cards with \nquestions to elicit information about the mental state of the individ-\nuals portrayed, such as “Where will the girl look for the lost bag?” \nor “Why is the boy sad?”  \nTABLE 1 Neurocognitive domains (continued)\nCognitive domain\nExamples of symptoms or observations\nExamples of assessments \n596\nNeurocognitive Disorders"}

Also includes individuals whose activity\nlevel rapidly fluctuates.\nRecording Procedures\nSubstance intoxication delirium\nICD-9-CM.\nThe name of the substance\/medication intoxication delirium begins with\nthe specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the\ndelirium. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which\nis based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexa-\nmethasone), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a sub-\nstance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown,\nthe category “unknown substance” should be used.\nThe name of the disorder is followed by the course (i.e., acute, persistent), followed by\nthe specifier indicating level of psychomotor activity (i.e., hyperactive, hypoactive, mixed\nlevel of activity). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the sub-\nstance\/medication intoxication delirium and substance use disorder into a single code, for\nICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example,\nin the case of acute hyperactive intoxication delirium occurring in a man with a severe co-\ncaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.81 cocaine intoxication delirium, acute, hyperac-\ntive. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use disorder is also given. If the\nintoxication delirium occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-\ntime heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g.,\n292.81 phencyclidine intoxication delirium, acute, hypoactive).\nICD-10-CM.\nThe name of the substance\/medication intoxication delirium begins with the\nspecific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the delirium.\nThe diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the\ndrug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that\ndo not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for “other substance” should\nbe used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific\nclass of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used.\nWhen recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is\nlisted first, followed by the word “with,” followed by the name of the substance intoxication\ndelirium, followed by the course (i.e., acute, persistent), followed by the specifier indicating\nlevel of psychomotor activity (i.e., hyperactive, hypoactive, mixed level of activity). For exam-\nple, in the case of acute hyperactive intoxication delirium occurring in a man with a severe co-\ncaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14.221 severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine\nintoxication delirium, acute, hyperactive. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine\nuse disorder is not given. If the intoxication delirium occurs without a comorbid substance use\ndisorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use\ndisorder is noted (e.g., F16.921 phencyclidine intoxication delirium, acute, hypoactive). \nSubstance withdrawal delirium\nICD-9-CM.\nThe name of the substance\/medication withdrawal delirium begins with the\nspecific substance (e.g., alcohol) that is presumed to be causing the withdrawal delirium. The\ndiagnostic code is selected from substance-specific codes included in the coding note included\nDelirium\n599\nin the criteria set. The name of the disorder is followed by the course (i.e., acute, persistent), fol-\nlowed by the specifier indicating level of psychomotor activity (i.e., hyperactive, hypoactive,\nmixed level of activity). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the\nsubstance\/medication withdrawal delirium and substance use disorder into a single code, for\nICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in\nthe case of acute hyperactive withdrawal delirium occurring in a man with a severe alcohol use\ndisorder, the diagnosis is 291.0 alcohol withdrawal delirium, acute, hyperactive. An additional\ndiagnosis of 303.90 severe alcohol use disorder is also given.\nICD-10-CM.\nThe name of the substance\/medication withdrawal delirium begins with\nthe specific substance (e.g., alcohol) that is presumed to be causing the withdrawal delir-\nium. The diagnostic code is selected from substance-specific codes included in the coding\nnote included in the criteria set. When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid\nmoderate or severe substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word\n“with,” followed by the substance withdrawal delirium, followed by the course (i.e., acute,\npersistent), followed by the specifier indicating level of psychomotor activity (i.e., hyper-\nactive, hypoactive, mixed level of activity). For example, in the case of acute hyperactive\nwithdrawal delirium occurring in a man with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis\nis F10.231 severe alcohol use disorder with alcohol withdrawal delirium, acute, hyperac-\ntive. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe alcohol use disorder is not given. \nMedication-induced delirium.\nThe name of the medication-induced delirium begins\nwith the specific substance (e.g., dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the de-\nlirium. The name of the disorder is followed by the course (i.e., acute, persistent), followed\nby the specifier indicating level of psychomotor activity (i.e., hyperactive, hypoactive,\nmixed level of activity). For example, in the case of acute hyperactive medication-induced\ndelirium occurring in a man using dexamethasone as prescribed, the diagnosis is 292.81\n(F19.921) dexamethasone-induced delirium, acute, hyperactive.\nSpecifiers\nRegarding course, in hospital settings, delirium usually lasts about 1 week, but some\nsymptoms often persist even after individuals are discharged from the hospital. \nIndividuals with delirium may rapidly switch between hyperactive and hypoactive\nstates. The hyperactive state may be more common or more frequently recognized and\noften is associated with medication side effects and drug withdrawal. The hypoactive state\nmay be more frequent in older adults.\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of delirium is a disturbance of attention or awareness that is accom-\npanied by a change in baseline cognition that cannot be better explained by a preexisting\nor evolving neurocognitive disorder (NCD). The disturbance in attention (Criterion A) is\nmanifested by reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift attention. Questions must\nbe repeated because the individual’s attention wanders, or the individual may perseverate\nwith an answer to a previous question rather than appropriately shift attention. The indi-\nvidual is easily distracted by irrelevant stimuli. The disturbance in awareness is mani-\nfested by a reduced orientation to the environment or at times even to oneself.\nThe disturbance develops over a short period of time, usually hours to a few days, and\ntends to fluctuate during the course of the day, often with worsening in the evening and\nnight when external orienting stimuli decrease (Criterion B). There is evidence from the\nhistory, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is a physiologi-\ncal consequence of an underlying medical condition, substance intoxication or with-\ndrawal, use of a medication, or a toxin exposure, or a combination of these factors\n(Criterion E). The etiology should be coded according to the etiologically appropriate sub-\ntype (i.e., substance or medication intoxication, substance withdrawal, another medical\n600\nNeurocognitive Disorders\ncondition, or multiple etiologies). Delirium often occurs in the context of an underlying\nNCD. The impaired brain function of individuals with mild and major NCD renders them\nmore vulnerable to delirium.\nThere is an accompanying change in at least one other area that may include memory\nand learning (particularly recent memory), disorientation (particularly to time and place),\nalteration in language, or perceptual distortion or a perceptual-motor disturbance (Crite-\nrion C). The perceptual disturbances accompanying delirium include misinterpretations,\nillusions, or hallucinations; these disturbances are typically visual, but may occur in other\nmodalities as well, and range from simple and uniform to highly complex. Normal atten-\ntion\/arousal, delirium, and coma lie on a continuum, with coma defined as the lack of any\nresponse to verbal stimuli. The ability to evaluate cognition to diagnose delirium depends\non there being a level of arousal sufficient for response to verbal stimulation; hence, delir-\nium should not be diagnosed in the context of coma (Criterion D). Many noncomatose pa-\ntients have a reduced level of arousal. Those patients who show only minimal responses to\nverbal stimulation are incapable of engaging with attempts at standardized testing or even\ninterview. This inability to engage should be classified as severe inattention. Low-arousal\nstates (of acute onset) should be recognized as indicating severe inattention and cognitive\nchange, and hence delirium. They are clinically indistinguishable from delirium diag-\nnosed on the basis of inattention or cognitive change elicited through cognitive testing and\ninterview. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nDelirium is often associated with a disturbance in the sleep-wake cycle. This disturbance\ncan include daytime sleepiness, nighttime agitation, difficulty falling asleep, excessive\nsleepiness throughout the day, or wakefulness throughout the night. In some cases, com-\nplete reversal of the night-day sleep-wake cycle can occur. Sleep-wake cycle disturbances\nare very common in delirium and have been proposed as a core criterion for the diagnosis.\nThe individual with delirium may exhibit emotional disturbances, such as anxiety,\nfear, depression, irritability, anger, euphoria, and apathy. There may be rapid and unpre-\ndictable shifts from one emotional state to another. The disturbed emotional state may also\nbe evident in calling out, screaming, cursing, muttering, moaning, or making other\nsounds. These behaviors are especially prevalent at night and under conditions in which\nstimulation and environmental cues are lacking. \nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of delirium is highest among hospitalized older individuals and varies\ndepending on the individuals’ characteristics, setting of care, and sensitivity of the detec-\ntion method. The prevalence of delirium in the community overall is low (1%–2%) but in-\ncreases with age, rising to 14% among individuals older than 85 years. The prevalence is\n10%–30% in older individuals presenting to emergency departments, where the delirium\noften indicates a medical illness. \nThe prevalence of delirium when individuals are admitted to the hospital ranges from\n14% to 24%, and estimates of the incidence of delirium arising during hospitalization\nrange from 6% to 56% in general hospital populations. Delirium occurs in 15%–53% of\nolder individuals postoperatively and in 70%–87% of those in intensive care. Delirium oc-\ncurs in up to 60% of individuals in nursing homes or post–acute care settings and in up to\n83% of all individuals at the end of life.\nDevelopment and Course\nWhile the majority of individuals with delirium have a full recovery with or without\ntreatment, early recognition and intervention usually shortens the duration of the delir-\nDelirium\n601\nium. Delirium may progress to stupor, coma, seizures, or death, particularly if the under-\nlying cause remains untreated. Mortality among hospitalized individuals with delirium is\nhigh, and as many as 40% of individuals with delirium, particularly those with malignan-\ncies and other significant underlying medical illness, die within a year after diagnosis. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nEnvironmental.\nDelirium may be increased in the context of functional impairment, im-\nmobility, a history of falls, low levels of activity, and use of drugs and medications with\npsychoactive properties (particularly alcohol and anticholinergics).\nGenetic and physiological.\nBoth major and mild NCDs can increase the risk for delir-\nium and complicate the course. Older individuals are especially susceptible to delirium\ncompared with younger adults. Susceptibility to delirium in infancy and through child-\nhood may be greater than in early and middle adulthood. In childhood, delirium may be\nrelated to febrile illnesses and certain medications (e.g., anticholinergics).\nDiagnostic Markers\nIn addition to laboratory findings characteristic of underlying medical conditions (or in-\ntoxication or withdrawal states), there is often generalized slowing on electroencephalog-\nraphy, and fast activity is occasionally found (e.g., in some cases of alcohol withdrawal\ndelirium). However, electroencephalography is insufficiently sensitive and specific for di-\nagnostic use.\nFunctional Consequences of Delirium \nDelirium itself is associated with increased functional decline and risk of institutional\nplacement. Hospitalized individuals 65 years or older with delirium have three times the\nrisk of nursing home placement and about three times the functional decline as hospital-\nized patients without delirium at both discharge and 3 months postdischarge. \nDifferential Diagnosis \nPsychotic disorders and bipolar and depressive disorders with psychotic features.\nDelirium that is characterized by vivid hallucinations, delusions, language disturbances,\nand agitation must be distinguished from brief psychotic disorder, schizophrenia, schizo-\nphreniform disorder, and other psychotic disorders, as well as from bipolar and depres-\nsive disorders with psychotic features.\nAcute stress disorder.\nDelirium associated with fear, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms,\nsuch as depersonalization, must be distinguished from acute stress disorder, which is pre-\ncipitated by exposure to a severely traumatic event.\nMalingering and factitious disorder.\nDelirium can be distinguished from these disor-\nders on the basis of the often atypical presentation in malingering and factitious disorder\nand the absence of another medical condition or substance that is etiologically related to\nthe apparent cognitive disturbance.\nOther neurocognitive disorders.\nThe most common differential diagnostic issue when\nevaluating confusion in older adults is disentangling symptoms of delirium and dementia.\nThe clinician must determine whether the individual has delirium; a delirium superim-\nposed on a preexisting NCD, such as that due to Alzheimer’s disease; or an NCD without\ndelirium. The traditional distinction between delirium and dementia according to acute-\nness of onset and temporal course is particularly difficult in those elderly individuals who\nhad a prior NCD that may not have been recognized, or who develop persistent cognitive\nimpairment following an episode of delirium. \n602\nNeurocognitive Disorders"}
{"Subcategory":"Neurocognitive Disorders","Code":"780.09 (R41.0)","Disorder":"Other Specified Delirium","Content":"Other Specified Delirium\n780.09 (R41.0)\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of delirium that\ncause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other impor-\ntant areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for delirium or any of\nthe disorders in the neurocognitive disorders diagnostic class.

These subtypes are distinguished on the basis of a combination of time course, charac-\nteristic domains affected, and associated symptoms. For certain etiological subtypes, the\ndiagnosis depends substantially on the presence of a potentially causative entity, such as Par-\nkinson’s or Huntington’s disease, or a traumatic brain injury or stroke in the appropriate time\nperiod. For other etiological subtypes (generally the neurodegenerative diseases like Alzhei-\nmer’s disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and Lewy body disease), the diagnosis is\nbased primarily on the cognitive, behavioral, and functional symptoms. Typically, the differ-\nentiation among these syndromes that lack an independently recognized etiological entity is\nclearer at the level of major NCD than at the level of mild NCD, but sometimes characteristic\nsymptoms and associated features are present at the mild level as well. \nNCDs are frequently managed by clinicians in multiple disciplines. For many sub-\ntypes, multidisciplinary international expert groups have developed specialized consen-\nsus criteria based on clinicopathological correlation with underlying brain pathology. The\nsubtype criteria here have been harmonized with those expert criteria.\nSpecifiers\nEvidence for distinct behavioral features in NCDs has been recognized, particularly in the\nareas of psychotic symptoms and depression. Psychotic features are common in many\nNCDs, particularly at the mild-to-moderate stage of major NCDs due to Alzheimer’s dis-\nease, Lewy body disease, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Paranoia and other\ndelusions are common features, and often a persecutory theme may be a prominent aspect\nof delusional ideation. In contrast to psychotic disorders with onset in earlier life (e.g.,\nschizophrenia), disorganized speech and disorganized behavior are not characteristic of\npsychosis in NCDs. Hallucinations may occur in any modality, although visual hallucina-\ntions are more common in NCDs than in depressive, bipolar, or psychotic disorders.\nMood disturbances, including depression, anxiety, and elation, may occur. Depression\nis common early in the course (including at the mild NCD level) of NCD due to Alzhei-\nmer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, while elation may occur more commonly in fron-\ntotemporal lobar degeneration. When a full affective syndrome meeting diagnostic criteria\nfor a depressive or bipolar disorder is present, that diagnosis should be coded as well.\nMood symptoms are increasingly recognized to be a significant feature in the earliest stages\nof mild NCDs such that clinical recognition and intervention may be important.\nAgitation is common in a wide variety of NCDs, particularly in major NCD of moder-\nate to severe severity, and often occurs in the setting of confusion or frustration. It may\narise as combative behaviors, particularly in the context of resisting caregiving duties such\nas bathing and dressing. Agitation is characterized as disruptive motor or vocal activity\nand tends to occur with advanced stages of cognitive impairment across all of the NCDs.\nIndividuals with NCD can present with a wide variety of behavioral symptoms that\nare the focus of treatment. Sleep disturbance is a common symptom that can create a need\nfor clinical attention and may include symptoms of insomnia, hypersomnia, and circadian\nrhythm disturbances.\nMajor and Mild Neurocognitive Disorders\n607\nApathy is common in mild and mild major NCD. It is observed particularly in NCD due\nto Alzheimer’s disease and may be a prominent feature of NCD due to frontotemporal\nlobar degeneration. Apathy is typically characterized by diminished motivation and re-\nduced goal-directed behavior accompanied by decreased emotional responsiveness.\nSymptoms of apathy may manifest early in the course of NCDs when a loss of motivation\nto pursue daily activities or hobbies may be observed.\nOther important behavioral symptoms include wandering, disinhibition, hyperpha-\ngia, and hoarding. Some of these symptoms are characteristic of specific disorders, as dis-\ncussed in the relevant sections. When more than one behavioral disturbance is observed,\neach type should be noted in writing with the specifier “with behavioral symptoms.” \nDiagnostic Features\nMajor and mild NCDs exist on a spectrum of cognitive and functional impairment. Major\nNCD corresponds to the condition referred to in DSM-IV as dementia, retained as an alter-\nnative in this volume. The core feature of NCDs is acquired cognitive decline in one or\nmore cognitive domains (Criterion A) based on both 1) a concern about cognition on the\npart of the individual, a knowledgeable informant, or the clinician, and 2) performance on\nan objective assessment that falls below the expected level or that has been observed to de-\ncline over time. Both a concern and objective evidence are required because they are com-\nplementary. When there is an exclusive focus on objective testing, a disorder may go\nundiagnosed in high-functioning individuals whose currently “normal” performance ac-\ntually represents a substantial decline in abilities, or an illness may be incorrectly diag-\nnosed in individuals whose currently “low” performance does not represent a change\nfrom their own baseline or is a result of extraneous factors like test conditions or a passing\nillness. Alternatively, excessive focus on subjective symptoms may fail to diagnose illness\nin individuals with poor insight, or whose informants deny or fail to notice their symptoms,\nor it may be overly sensitive in the so-called worried well.\nA cognitive concern differs from a complaint in that it may or may not be voiced spon-\ntaneously. Rather, it may need to be elicited by careful questioning about specific symp-\ntoms that commonly occur in individuals with cognitive deficits (see Table 1 in the\nintroduction to this chapter). For example, memory concerns include difficulty remember-\ning a short grocery list or keeping track of the plot of a television program; executive con-\ncerns include difficulty resuming a task when interrupted, organizing tax records, or\nplanning a holiday meal. At the mild NCD level, the individual is likely to describe these\ntasks as being more difficult or as requiring extra time or effort or compensatory strategies.\nAt the major NCD level, such tasks may only be completed with assistance or may be\nabandoned altogether. At the mild NCD level, individuals and their families may not no-\ntice such symptoms or may view them as normal, particularly in the elderly; thus, careful\nhistory taking is of paramount importance. The difficulties must represent changes rather\nthan lifelong patterns: the individual or informant may clarify this issue, or the clinician\ncan infer change from prior experience with the patient or from occupational or other\nclues. It is also critical to determine that the difficulties are related to cognitive loss rather\nthan to motor or sensory limitations. \nNeuropsychological testing, with performance compared with norms appropriate to\nthe patient’s age, educational attainment, and cultural background, is part of the standard\nevaluation of NCDs and is particularly critical in the evaluation of mild NCD. For major\nNCD, performance is typically 2 or more standard deviations below appropriate norms\n(3rd percentile or below). For mild NCD, performance typically lies in the 1–2 standard de-\nviation range (between the 3rd and 16th percentiles). However, neuropsychological test-\ning is not available in all settings, and neuropsychological thresholds are sensitive to the\nspecific test(s) and norms employed, as well as to test conditions, sensory limitations, and\nintercurrent illness. A variety of brief office-based or “bedside” assessments, as described\n608\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nin Table 1, can also supply objective data in settings where such testing is unavailable or\ninfeasible. In any case, as with cognitive concerns, objective performance must be inter-\npreted in light of the individual’s prior performance. Optimally, this information would\nbe available from a prior administration of the same test, but often it must be inferred\nbased on appropriate norms, along with the individual’s educational history, occupation,\nand other factors. Norms are more challenging to interpret in individuals with very high\nor very low levels of education and in individuals being tested outside their own language\nor cultural background. \nCriterion B relates to the individual’s level of independence in everyday functioning.\nIndividuals with major NCD will have impairment of sufficient severity so as to interfere\nwith independence, such that others will have to take over tasks that the individuals were\npreviously able to complete on their own. Individuals with mild NCD will have preserved\nindependence, although there may be subtle interference with function or a report that\ntasks require more effort or take more time than previously. \nThe distinction between major and mild NCD is inherently arbitrary, and the disorders\nexist along a continuum. Precise thresholds are therefore difficult to determine. Careful\nhistory taking, observation, and integration with other findings are required, and the im-\nplications of diagnosis should be considered when an individual’s clinical manifestations\nlie at a boundary.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nTypically the associated features that support a diagnosis of major or mild NCD will be\nspecific to the etiological subtype (e.g., neuroleptic sensitivity and visual hallucinations in\nNCD due to Lewy body disease). Diagnostic features specific to each of the subtypes are\nfound in the relevant sections.\nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of NCD varies widely by age and by etiological subtype. Overall preva-\nlence estimates are generally only available for older populations. Among individuals\nolder than 60 years, prevalence increases steeply with age, so prevalence estimates are\nmore accurate for narrow age bands than for broad categories such as “over 65” (where the\nmean age can vary greatly with the life expectancy of the given population). For those eti-\nological subtypes occurring across the lifespan, prevalence estimates for NCD are likely to\nbe available, if at all, only as the fraction of individuals who develop NCD among those\nwith the relevant condition (e.g., traumatic brain injury, HIV infection).\nOverall prevalence estimates for dementia (which is largely congruent with major\nNCD) are approximately 1%–2% at age 65 years and as high as 30% by age 85 years. The\nprevalence of mild NCD is very sensitive to the definition of the disorder, particularly in\ncommunity settings, where evaluations are less detailed. In addition, in contrast with clin-\nical settings, where cognitive concern must be high to seek and locate care, there may be a\nless clear decline from baseline functioning. Estimates of the prevalence of mild cognitive\nimpairment (which is substantially congruent with mild NCD) among older individuals\nare fairly variable, ranging from 2% to 10% at age 65 and 5% to 25% by age 85.\nDevelopment and Course \nThe course of NCD varies across etiological subtypes, and this variation can be useful in\ndifferential diagnosis. Some subtypes (e.g., those related to traumatic brain injury or\nstroke) typically begin at a specific time and (at least after initial symptoms related to in-\nflammation or swelling subside) remain static. Others may fluctuate over time (although\nif this occurs, the possibility of delirium superimposed on NCD should be considered).\nNCDs due to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease or frontotemporal\nlobar degeneration typically are marked by insidious onset and gradual progression, and\nMajor and Mild Neurocognitive Disorders\n609\nthe pattern of onset of cognitive deficits and associated features helps to distinguish among\nthem. \nNCDs with onset in childhood and adolescence may have broad repercussions for so-\ncial and intellectual development, and in this setting intellectual disability (intellectual\ndevelopmental disorder) and\/or other neurodevelopmental disorders may also be diag-\nnosed to capture the full diagnostic picture and ensure the provision of a broad range of\nservices. In older individuals, NCDs often occur in the setting of medical illnesses, frailty,\nand sensory loss, which complicate the clinical picture for diagnosis and treatment. \nWhen cognitive loss occurs in youth to midlife, individuals and families are likely to\nseek care. NCDs are typically easiest to identify at younger ages, although in some settings\nmalingering or other factitious disorders may be a concern. Very late in life, cognitive\nsymptoms may not cause concern or may go unnoticed. In late life, mild NCD must also be\ndistinguished from the more modest deficits associated with “normal aging,” although a\nsubstantial fraction of what has been ascribed to normal aging likely represents prodromal\nphases of various NCDs. In addition, it becomes harder to recognize mild NCD with age\nbecause of the increasing prevalence of medical illness and sensory deficits. It becomes\nharder to differentiate among subtypes with age because there are multiple potential sources\nof neurocognitive decline.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nRisk factors vary not only by etiological subtype but also by age at onset within etiological\nsubtypes. Some subtypes are distributed throughout the lifespan, whereas others occur\nexclusively or primarily in late life. Even within the NCDs of aging, the relative prevalence\nvaries with age: Alzheimer’s disease is uncommon before age 60 years, and the prevalence\nincreases steeply thereafter, while the overall less common frontotemporal lobar degener-\nation has earlier onset and represents a progressively smaller fraction of NCDs with age. \nGenetic and physiological.\nThe strongest risk factor for major and mild NCDs is age,\nprimarily because age increases the risk of neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular dis-\nease. Female gender is associated with higher prevalence of dementia overall, and especially\nAlzheimer’s disease, but this difference is largely, if not wholly, attributable to greater lon-\ngevity in females. \nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nIndividuals’ and families’ level of awareness and concern about neurocognitive symp-\ntoms may vary across ethnic and occupational groups. Neurocognitive symptoms are\nmore likely to be noticed, particularly at the mild level, in individuals who engage in com-\nplex occupational, domestic, or recreational activities. In addition, norms for neuropsy-\nchological testing tend to be available only for broad populations, and thus they may not\nbe easily applicable to individuals with less than high school education or those being\nevaluated outside their primary language or culture. \nGender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nLike age, culture, and occupation, gender issues may affect the level of concern and aware-\nness of cognitive symptoms. In addition, for late-life NCDs, females are likely to be older,\nto have more medical comorbidity, and to live alone, which can complicate evaluation and\ntreatment. In addition, there are gender differences in the frequency of some of the etio-\nlogical subtypes.\nDiagnostic Markers\nIn addition to a careful history, neuropsychological assessments are the key measures for\ndiagnosis of NCDs, particularly at the mild level, where functional changes are minimal\n610\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nand symptoms more subtle. Ideally, individuals will be referred for formal neuropsycho-\nlogical testing, which will provide a quantitative assessment of all relevant domains and\nthus help with diagnosis; provide guidance to the family on areas where the individual\nmay require more support; and serve as a benchmark for further decline or response to\ntherapies. When such testing is unavailable or not feasible, the brief assessments in Table 1\ncan provide insight into each domain. More global brief mental status tests may be helpful\nbut may be insensitive, particularly to modest changes in a single domain or in those with\nhigh premorbid abilities, and may be overly sensitive in those with low premorbid abilities.\nIn distinguishing among etiological subtypes, additional diagnostic markers may\ncome into play, particularly neuroimaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging\nscans and positron emission tomography scans. In addition, specific markers may be in-\nvolved in the assessment of specific subtypes and may become more important as addi-\ntional research findings accumulate over time, as discussed in the relevant sections. \nFunctional Consequences of \nMajor and Mild Neurocognitive Disorders \nBy definition, major and mild NCDs affect functioning, given the central role of cognition in\nhuman life. Thus, the criteria for the disorders, and the threshold for differentiating mild\nfrom major NCD, are based in part on functional assessment. Within major NCD there is a\nbroad range of functional impairment, as implemented in the severity specifiers. In addition,\nthe specific functions that are compromised can help identify the cognitive domains affected,\nparticularly when neuropsychological testing is not available or is difficult to interpret. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nNormal cognition.\nThe differential diagnosis between normal cognition and mild NCD,\nas between mild and major NCD, is challenging because the boundaries are inherently ar-\nbitrary. Careful history taking and objective assessment are critical to these distinctions. A\nlongitudinal evaluation using quantified assessments may be key in detecting mild NCD.\nDelirium.\nBoth mild and major NCD may be difficult to distinguish from a persistent de-\nlirium, which can co-occur. Careful assessment of attention and arousal will help to make\nthe distinction.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nThe distinction between mild NCD and major depressive\ndisorder, which may co-occur with NCD, can also be challenging. Specific patterns of cog-\nnitive deficits may be helpful. For example, consistent memory and executive function\ndeficits are typical of Alzheimer’s disease, whereas nonspecific or more variable perfor-\nmance is seen in major depression. Alternatively, treatment of the depressive disorder\nwith repeated observation over time may be required to make the diagnosis.\nSpecific learning disorder and other neurodevelopmental disorders.\nA careful clari-\nfication of the individual’s baseline status will help distinguish an NCD from a specific\nlearning disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders. Additional issues may enter the\ndifferential for specific etiological subtypes, as described in the relevant sections.\nComorbidity \nNCDs are common in older individuals and thus often co-occur with a wide variety of age-\nrelated diseases that may complicate diagnosis or treatment. Most notable of these is\ndelirium, for which NCD increases the risk. In older individuals, a delirium during hos-\npitalization is, in many cases, the first time that an NCD is noticed, although a careful his-\ntory will often reveal evidence of earlier decline. Mixed NCDs are also common in older\nindividuals, as many etiological entities increase in prevalence with age. In younger indi-\nviduals, NCD often co-occurs with neurodevelopmental disorders; for example, a head in-\nMajor or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer’s Disease\n611\njury in a preschool child may also lead to significant developmental and learning issues.\nAdditional comorbidity of NCD is often related to the etiological subtype, as discussed in\nthe relevant sections. \nMajor or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder\n Due to Alzheimer’s Disease\nDiagnostic Criteria\n \nA.

At the mild\nNCD phase, Alzheimer’s disease manifests typically with impairment in memory and learn-\ning, sometimes accompanied by deficits in executive function. At the major NCD phase,\nvisuoconstructional\/perceptual-motor ability and language will also be impaired, partic-\nularly when the NCD is moderate to severe. Social cognition tends to be preserved until\nlate in the course of the disease. \nA level of diagnostic certainty must be specified denoting Alzheimer’s disease as the\n“probable” or “possible” etiology (Criterion C). Probable Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed in\nboth major and mild NCD if there is evidence of a causative Alzheimer’s disease gene, ei-\nther from genetic testing or from an autosomal dominant family history coupled with au-\ntopsy confirmation or a genetic test in an affected family member. For major NCD, a\ntypical clinical picture, without extended plateaus or evidence of mixed etiology, can also\nbe diagnosed as due to probable Alzheimer’s disease. For mild NCD, given the lesser de-\ngree of certainty that the deficits will progress, these features are only sufficient for a\npossible Alzheimer’s etiology. If the etiology appears mixed, mild NCD due to multiple eti-\nologies should be diagnosed. In any case, for both mild and major NCD due to Alzhei-\nmer’s disease, the clinical features must not suggest another primary etiology for the NCD\n(Criterion D). \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIn specialty clinical settings, approximately 80% of individuals with major NCD due to\nAlzheimer’s disease have behavioral and psychological manifestations; these features are\nalso frequent at the mild NCD stage of impairment. These symptoms are as or more dis-\ntressing than cognitive manifestations and are frequently the reason that health care is\nsought. At the mild NCD stage or the mildest level of major NCD, depression and\/or ap-\nathy are often seen. With moderately severe major NCD, psychotic features, irritability,\nagitation, combativeness, and wandering are common. Late in the illness, gait distur-\nbance, dysphagia, incontinence, myoclonus, and seizures are observed.\nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of overall dementia (major NCD) rises steeply with age. In high-income\ncountries, it ranges from 5% to 10% in the seventh decade to at least 25% thereafter. U.S.\ncensus data estimates suggest that approximately 7% of individuals diagnosed with Alz-\nheimer’s disease are between ages 65 and 74 years, 53% are between ages 75 and 84 years,\nand 40% are 85 years and older. The percentage of dementias attributable to Alzheimer’s\ndisease ranges from about 60% to over 90%, depending on the setting and diagnostic cri-\nteria. Mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease is likely to represent a substantial fraction of\nmild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well.\nDevelopment and Course\nMajor or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease progresses gradually, sometimes with\nbrief plateaus, through severe dementia to death. The mean duration of survival after di-\nMajor or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer’s Disease\n613\nagnosis is approximately 10 years, reflecting the advanced age of the majority of individ-\nuals rather than the course of the disease; some individuals can live with the disease for as\nlong as 20 years. Late-stage individuals are eventually mute and bedbound. Death most\ncommonly results from aspiration in those who survive through the full course. In mild\nNCD due to Alzheimer’s disease, impairments increase over time, and functional status\ngradually declines until symptoms reach the threshold for the diagnosis of major NCD. \nThe onset of symptoms is usually in the eighth and ninth decades; early-onset forms\nseen in the fifth and sixth decades are often related to known causative mutations. Symp-\ntoms and pathology do not differ markedly at different onset ages. However, younger in-\ndividuals are more likely to survive the full course of the disease, while older individuals\nare more likely to have numerous medical comorbidities that affect the course and man-\nagement of the illness. Diagnostic complexity is higher in older adults because of the in-\ncreased likelihood of comorbid medical illness and mixed pathology.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nEnvironmental.\nTraumatic brain injury increases risk for major or mild NCD due to Alz-\nheimer’s disease.\nGenetic and physiological.\nAge is the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. The\ngenetic susceptibility polymorphism apolipoprotein E4 increases risk and decreases age\nat onset, particularly in homozygous individuals. There are also extremely rare causative\nAlzheimer’s disease genes. Individuals with Down’s syndrome (trisomy 21) develop Alz-\nheimer’s disease if they survive to midlife. Multiple vascular risk factors influence risk for\nAlzheimer’s disease and may act by increasing cerebrovascular pathology or also through\ndirect effects on Alzheimer pathology. \nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nDetection of an NCD may be more difficult in cultural and socioeconomic settings where\nmemory loss is considered normal in old age, where older adults face fewer cognitive de-\nmands in everyday life, or where very low educational levels pose greater challenges to\nobjective cognitive assessment.\nDiagnostic Markers\nCortical atrophy, amyloid-predominant neuritic plaques, and tau-predominant neurofibril-\nlary tangles are hallmarks of the pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and may be\nconfirmed via postmortem histopathological examination. For early-onset cases with auto-\nsomal dominant inheritance, a mutation in one of the known causative Alzheimer’s disease\ngenes—amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), or presenilin 2 (PSEN2)—\nmay be involved, and genetic testing for such mutations is commercially available, at least\nfor PSEN1. Apolipoprotein E4 cannot serve as a diagnostic marker because it is only a risk\nfactor and neither necessary nor sufficient for disease occurrence.\nSince amyloid beta-42 deposition in the brain occurs early in the pathophysiological\ncascade, amyloid-based diagnostic tests such as amyloid imaging on brain positron emis-\nsion tomography (PET) scans and reduced levels of amyloid beta-42 in the cerebrospinal\nfluid (CSF) may have diagnostic value. Signs of neuronal injury, such as hippocampal and\ntemporoparietal cortical atrophy on a magnetic resonance image scan, temporoparietal\nhypometabolism on a fluorodeoxyglucose PET scan, and evidence for elevated total tau\nand phospho-tau levels in CSF, provide evidence of neuronal damage but are less specific\nfor Alzheimer’s disease. At present, these biomarkers are not fully validated, and many\nare available only in tertiary care settings. However, some of them, along with novel bio-\nmarkers, will likely move into wider clinical practice in the coming years. \n614\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nFunctional Consequences of Major or Mild \nNeurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer’s Disease\nThe prominence of memory loss can cause significant difficulties relatively early in the\ncourse. Social cognition (and thus social functioning) and procedural memory (e.g., danc-\ning, playing musical instruments) may be relatively preserved for extended periods.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther neurocognitive disorders.\nMajor and mild NCDs due to other neurodegenera-\ntive processes (e.g., Lewy body disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration) share the in-\nsidious onset and gradual decline caused by Alzheimer’s disease but have distinctive core\nfeatures of their own. In major or mild vascular NCD, there is typically history of stroke\ntemporally related to the onset of cognitive impairment, and infarcts or white matter hy-\nperintensities are judged sufficient to account for the clinical picture. However, particu-\nlarly when there is no clear history of stepwise decline, major or mild vascular NCD can\nshare many clinical features with Alzheimer’s disease. \nOther concurrent, active neurological or systemic illness.\nOther neurological or sys-\ntemic illness should be considered if there is an appropriate temporal relationship and\nseverity to account for the clinical picture. At the mild NCD level, it may be difficult to dis-\ntinguish an Alzheimer’s disease etiology from that of another medical condition (e.g., thy-\nroid disorders, vitamin B12 deficiency). \nMajor depressive disorder.\nParticularly at the mild NCD level, the differential diagnosis\nalso includes major depression. The presence of depression may be associated with re-\nduced daily functioning and poor concentration that may resemble an NCD, but improve-\nment with treatment of depression may be useful in making the distinction. \nComorbidity\nMost individuals with Alzheimer’s disease are elderly and have multiple medical conditions\nthat can complicate diagnosis and influence the clinical course. Major or mild NCD due to\nAlzheimer’s disease commonly co-occurs with cerebrovascular disease, which contributes\nto the clinical picture. When a comorbid condition contributes to the NCD in an individual\nwith Alzheimer’s disease, then NCD due to multiple etiologies should be diagnosed.\nMajor or Mild Frontotemporal\nNeurocognitive Disorder\nDiagnostic Criteria\n \nA. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.\nB. The disturbance has insidious onset and gradual progression.\nC. Either (1) or (2):\n1. Behavioral variant:\na. Three or more of the following behavioral symptoms:\ni. Behavioral disinhibition.\nii. Apathy or inertia.\niii. Loss of sympathy or empathy.\niv. Perseverative, stereotyped or compulsive\/ritualistic behavior.\nv. Hyperorality and dietary changes.\nb. Prominent decline in social cognition and\/or executive abilities.\nMajor or Mild Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder\n615\n2. Language variant:\na. Prominent decline in language ability, in the form of speech production, word\nfinding, object naming, grammar, or word comprehension.\nD. Relative sparing of learning and memory and perceptual-motor function.\nE. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease, another neurode-\ngenerative disease, the effects of a substance, or another mental, neurological, or sys-\ntemic disorder.\nProbable frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if either of the following\nis present; otherwise, possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder should be di-\nagnosed: \n1. Evidence of a causative frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder genetic mutation, from\neither family history or genetic testing.\n2. Evidence of disproportionate frontal and\/or temporal lobe involvement from neuroim-\naging.\nPossible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if there is no evidence\nof a genetic mutation, and neuroimaging has not been performed.\nCoding note: For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar de-\ngeneration, with behavioral disturbance, code first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal dis-\nease, followed by 294.11 (F02.81) probable major neurocognitive disorder due to\nfrontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance.

(Note: Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral\ndisturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.)\nDiagnostic Features\nMajor or mild frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (NCD) comprises a number of syn-\ndromic variants characterized by the progressive development of behavioral and personality\nchange and\/or language impairment. The behavioral variant and three language variants (se-\nmantic, agrammatic\/nonfluent, and logopenic) exhibit distinct patterns of brain atrophy and\nsome distinctive neuropathology. The criteria must be met for either the behavioral or the lan-\nguage variant to make the diagnosis, but many individuals present with features of both.\nIndividuals with behavioral-variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD present with\nvarying degrees of apathy or disinhibition. They may lose interest in socialization, self-\ncare, and personal responsibilities, or display socially inappropriate behaviors. Insight is\nusually impaired, and this often delays medical consultation. The first referral is often to a\npsychiatrist. Individuals may develop changes in social style, and in religious and political\nbeliefs, with repetitive movements, hoarding, changes in eating behavior, and hyperoral-\nity. In later stages, loss of sphincter control may occur. Cognitive decline is less prominent,\nand formal testing may show relatively few deficits in the early stages. Common neuro-\ncognitive symptoms are lack of planning and organization, distractibility, and poor judg-\nment. Deficits in executive function, such as poor performance on tests of mental\n616\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nflexibility, abstract reasoning, and response inhibition, are present, but learning and mem-\nory are relatively spared, and perceptual-motor abilities are almost always preserved in\nthe early stages. \nIndividuals with language-variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD present with pri-\nmary progressive aphasia with gradual onset, with three subtypes commonly described:\nsemantic variant, agrammatic\/nonfluent variant, and logopenic variant, and each variant\nhas distinctive features and corresponding neuropathology.\n“Probable” is distinguished from “possible” frontotemporal NCD by the presence of\ncausative genetic factors (e.g., mutations in the gene coding for microtubule-associated pro-\ntein tau) or by the presence of distinctive atrophy or reduced activity in frontotemporal re-\ngions on structural or functional imaging. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nExtrapyramidal features may be prominent in some cases, with an overlap with syn-\ndromes such as progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. Features of\nmotor neuron disease may be present in some cases (e.g., muscle atrophy, weakness). A\nsubset of individuals develop visual hallucinations.\nPrevalence\nMajor or mild frontotemporal NCD is a common cause of early-onset NCD in individuals\nyounger than 65 years. Population prevalence estimates are in the range of 2–10 per\n100,000. Approximately 20%–25% of cases of frontotemporal NCD occur in individuals\nolder than 65 years. Frontotemporal NCD accounts for about 5% of all cases of dementia in\nunselected autopsy series. Prevalence estimates of behavioral variant and semantic lan-\nguage variant are higher among males, and prevalence estimates of nonfluent language\nvariant are higher among females. \nDevelopment and Course\nIndividuals with major or mild frontotemporal NCD commonly present in the sixth de-\ncade of life, although the age at onset varies from the third to the ninth decades. The dis-\nease is gradually progressive, with median survival being 6–11 years after symptom onset\nand 3–4 years after diagnosis. Survival is shorter and decline is faster in major or mild fron-\ntotemporal NCD than in typical Alzheimer’s disease. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nGenetic and physiological.\nApproximately 40% of individuals with major or mild fron-\ntotemporal NCD have a family history of early-onset NCD, and approximately 10% show an\nautosomal dominant inheritance pattern. A number of genetic factors have been identified,\nsuch as mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT), the\ngranulin gene (GRN), and the C9ORF72 gene. A number of families with causative muta-\ntions have been identified (see the section “Diagnostic Markers” for this disorder), but many\nindividuals with known familial transmission do not have a known mutation. The presence\nof motor neuron disease is associated with a more rapid deterioration. \nDiagnostic Markers\nComputed tomography (CT) or structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may show\ndistinct patterns of atrophy. In behavioral-variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD,\nboth frontal lobes (especially the medial frontal lobes) and the anterior temporal lobes are\natrophic. In semantic language–variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD, the middle,\ninferior, and anterior temporal lobes are atrophic bilaterally but asymmetrically, with the\nMajor or Mild Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder\n617\nleft side usually being more affected. Nonfluent language–variant major or mild fronto-\ntemporal NCD is associated with predominantly left posterior frontal-insular atrophy.\nThe logopenic variant of major or mild frontotemporal NCD is associated with predomi-\nnantly left posterior perisylvian or parietal atrophy. Functional imaging demonstrates hy-\npoperfusion and\/or cortical hypometabolism in the corresponding brain regions, which\nmay be present in the early stages in the absence of structural abnormality. Emerging bio-\nmarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta and tau levels, and\namyloid imaging) may help in the differential diagnosis, but the distinction from Alzhei-\nmer’s disease can remain difficult (the logopenic variant is in fact often a manifestation of\nAlzheimer’s disease).\nIn familial cases of frontotemporal NCD, the identification of genetic mutations may\nhelp confirm the diagnosis. Mutations associated with frontotemporal NCD include\nthe genes encoding microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) and granulin (GRN),\nC9ORF72, transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43, or TARDBP),\nvalosin-containing protein (VCP), chromatin modifying protein 2B (CHMP2B), and fused\nin sarcoma protein (FUS). \nFunctional Consequences of Major or Mild \nFrontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder\nBecause of the relative early age at onset of the disorder, the disorder oftens affects work-\nplace and family life. Because of the involvement of language and\/or behavior, function is\noften more severely impaired relatively early in the course. For individuals with the be-\nhavioral variant, prior to diagnostic clarification there may be significant family disrup-\ntion, legal involvement, and problems in the workplace because of socially inappropriate\nbehaviors. The functional impairment due to behavioral change and language dysfunc-\ntion, which can include hyperorality, impulsive wandering, and other dishinhibited be-\nhaviors, may far exceed that due to the cognitive disturbance and may lead to nursing\nhome placement or institutionalization. These behaviors can be severely disruptive, even\nin structured care settings, particularly when the individuals are otherwise healthy, non-\nfrail, and free of other medical comorbidities. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther neurocognitive disorders.\nOther neurodegenerative diseases may be distinguished\nfrom major or mild frontotemporal NCD by their characteristic features. In major or mild\nNCD due to Alzheimer’s disease, decline in learning and memory is an early feature.\nHowever, 10%–30% of patients presenting with a syndrome suggestive of major or mild\nfrontotemporal NCD are found at autopsy to have Alzheimer’s disease pathology. This oc-\ncurs more frequently in individuals who present with progressive dysexecutive syn-\ndromes in the absence of behavioral changes or movement disorder or in those with the\nlogopenic variant.\nIn major or mild NCD with Lewy bodies, core and suggestive features of Lewy bodies\nmust be present. In major or mild NCD due to Parkinson’s disease, spontaneous parkin-\nsonism emerges well before the cognitive decline. In major or mild vascular NCD, depend-\ning on affected brain regions, there may also be loss of executive ability and behavioral\nchanges such as apathy, and this disorder should be considered in the differential diagno-\nsis. However, history of a cerebrovascular event is temporally related to the onset of cog-\nnitive impairment in major or mild vascular NCD, and neuroimaging reveals infarctions\nor white matter lesions sufficient to account for the clinical picture. \nOther neurological conditions.\nMajor or mild frontotemporal NCD overlaps with pro-\ngressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and motor neuron disease\nclinically as well as pathologically. Progressive supranuclear palsy is characterized by\n618\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nsupranuclear gaze palsies and axial-predominant parkinsonism. Pseudobulbar signs may\nbe present, and retropulsion is often prominent. Neurocognitive assessment shows psy-\nchomotor slowing, poor working memory, and executive dysfunction. Corticobasal degen-\neration presents with asymmetric rigidity, limb apraxia, postural instability, myoclonus,\nalien limb phenomenon, and cortical sensory loss. Many individuals with behavioral-variant\nmajor or mild frontotemporal NCD show features of motor neuron disease, which tend to\nbe mixed upper and predominantly lower motor neuron disease. \nOther mental disorders and medical conditions.\nBehavioral-variant major or mild fron-\ntotemporal NCD may be mistaken for a primary mental disorder, such as major depression,\nbipolar disorders, or schizophrenia, and individuals with this variant often present initially\nto psychiatry. Over time, the development of progressive neurocognitive difficulties will\nhelp to make the distinction. A careful medical evaluation will help to exclude treatable\ncauses of NCDs, such as metabolic disturbances, nutritional deficiencies, and infections. \nMajor or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder\nWith Lewy Bodies\nDiagnostic Criteria\n \nA. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.\nB. The disorder has an insidious onset and gradual progression.\nC. The disorder meets a combination of core diagnostic features and suggestive diagnos-\ntic features for either probable or possible neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies.\nFor probable major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies, the indi-\nvidual has two core features, or one suggestive feature with one or more core features.\nFor possible major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies, the individ-\nual has only one core feature, or one or more suggestive features.\n1. Core diagnostic features: \na. Fluctuating cognition with pronounced variations in attention and alertness.\nb. Recurrent visual hallucinations that are well formed and detailed.\nc. Spontaneous features of parkinsonism, with onset subsequent to the develop-\nment of cognitive decline.\n2. Suggestive diagnostic features:\na. Meets criteria for rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.\nb. Severe neuroleptic sensitivity.\nD. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease, another neurode-\ngenerative disease, the effects of a substance, or another mental, neurological, or sys-\ntemic disorder.\nCoding note: For probable major neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies, with behav-\nioral disturbance, code first 331.82 (G31.83) Lewy body disease, followed by 294.11\n(F02.81) probable major neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies, with behavioral distur-\nbance. For probable major neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies, without behavioral\ndisturbance, code first 331.82 (G31.83) Lewy body disease, followed by 294.10 (F02.80)\nprobable major neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies, without behavioral disturbance.\nFor possible major neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies, code 331.9 (G31.9) possible\nmajor neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies. (Note: Do not use the additional code for\nLewy body disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated\nin writing.)\nMajor or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder With Lewy Bodies\n619\nFor mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies, code 331.83 (G31.84). (Note: Do not\nuse the additional code for Lewy body disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded\nbut should still be indicated in writing.)\nDiagnostic Features\nMajor or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies (NCDLB), in the case of major\nneurocognitive disorder (NCD), corresponds to the condition known as dementia with\nLewy bodies (DLB). The disorder includes not only progressive cognitive impairment\n(with early changes in complex attention and executive function rather than learning and\nmemory) but also recurrent complex visual hallucinations; and concurrent symptoms of\nrapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (which can be a very early manifes-\ntation); as well as hallucinations in other sensory modalities, depression, and delusions.\nThe symptoms fluctuate in a pattern that can resemble a delirium, but no adequate under-\nlying cause can be found. The variable presentation of NCDLB symptoms reduces the like-\nlihood of all symptoms being observed in a brief clinic visit and necessitates a thorough\nassessment of caregiver observations. The use of assessment scales specifically designed to\nassess fluctuation may aid in diagnosis. Another core feature is spontaneous parkinson-\nism, which must begin after the onset of cognitive decline; by convention, major cognitive\ndeficits are observed at least 1 year before the motor symptoms. The parkinsonism must\nalso be distinguished from neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal signs. Accurate diagnosis\nis essential to safe treatment planning, as up to 50% of individuals with NCDLB have se-\nvere sensitivity to neuroleptic drugs, and these medications should be used with extreme\ncaution in managing the psychotic manifestations.\nThe diagnosis of mild NCDLB is appropriate for individuals who present with the core\nor suggestive features at a stage when cognitive or functional impairments are not of suf-\nficient severity to fulfill criteria for major NCD. However, as for all mild NCDs, there will\noften be insufficient evidence to justify any single etiology, and use of the unspecified di-\nagnosis is most appropriate.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with NCDLB frequently experience repeated falls and syncope and transient\nepisodes of unexplained loss of consciousness. Autonomic dysfunction, such as ortho-\nstatic hypotension and urinary incontinence, may be observed. Auditory and other\nnonvisual hallucinations are common, as are systematized delusions, delusional misiden-\ntification, and depression.\nPrevalence\nThe few population-based prevalence estimates for NCDLB available range from 0.1% to\n5% of the general elderly population, and from 1.7% to 30.5% of all dementia cases. In\nbrain bank (autopsy) series, the pathological lesions known as Lewy bodies are present in\n20%–35% of cases of dementia. The male-to-female ratio is approximately 1.5:1. \nDevelopment and Course \nNCDLB is a gradually progressive disorder with insidious onset. However, there is often\na prodromal history of confusional episodes (delirium) of acute onset, often precipitated\nby illness or surgery. The distinction between NCDLB, in which Lewy bodies are primar-\nily cortical in location, and major or mild NCD due to Parkinson’s disease, in which the pa-\nthology is primarily in the basal ganglia, is the order in which the cognitive and motor\nsymptoms emerge. In NCDLB, the cognitive decline is manifested early in the course of ill-\nness, at least a year before the onset of motor symptoms (see the section “Differential Di-\n620\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nagnosis” for this disorder). Disease course may be characterized by occasional plateaus\nbut eventually progresses through severe dementia to death. Average duration of survival\nis 5–7 years in clinical series. Onset of symptoms is typically observed from the sixth\nthrough the ninth decades of life, with most cases having their onset when affected indi-\nviduals are in their mid-70s.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nGenetic and physiological.\nFamilial aggregation may occur, and several risk genes have\nbeen identified, but in most cases of NCDLB, there is no family history.\nDiagnostic Markers\nThe underlying neurodegenerative disease is primarily a synucleinopathy due to alpha-\nsynuclein misfolding and aggregation. Cognitive testing beyond the use of a brief screen-\ning instrument may be necessary to define deficits clearly. Assessment scales developed to\nmeasure fluctuation can be useful. The associated condition REM sleep behavior disorder\nmay be diagnosed through a formal sleep study or identified by questioning the patient or\ninformant about relevant symptoms. Neuroleptic sensitivity (challenge) is not recom-\nmended as a diagnostic marker but raises suspicion of NCDLB if it occurs. A diagnosti-\ncally suggestive feature is low striatal dopamine transporter uptake on single photon\nemission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) scan.\nOther clinically useful markers potentially include relative preservation of medial tempo-\nral structures on computed tomography (CT)\/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain\nscan; reduced striatal dopamine transporter uptake on SPECT\/PET scan; generalized low\nuptake on SPECT\/PET perfusion scan with reduced occipital activity; abnormal (low up-\ntake) MIBG myocardial scintigraphy suggesting sympathetic denervation; and prominent\nslow-wave activity on the electroencephalogram with temporal lobe transient waves.\nFunctional Consequences of Major or Mild \nNeurocognitive Disorder With Lewy Bodies\nIndividuals with NCDLB are more functionally impaired than would be expected for their\ncognitive deficits when contrasted to individuals with other neurodegenerative diseases,\nsuch as Alzheimer’s disease. This is largely a result of motor and autonomic impairments,\nwhich cause problems with toileting, transferring, and eating. Sleep disorders and prom-\ninent psychiatric symptoms may also add to functional difficulties. Consequently, the qual-\nity of life of individuals with NCDLB is often significantly worse than that of individuals\nwith Alzheimer’s disease.\nDifferential Diagnosis \nMajor or mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson’s disease.\nA key differenti-\nating feature in clinical diagnosis is the temporal sequence in which the parkinsonism and\nthe NCD appear. For NCD due to Parkinson’s disease, the individual must develop cog-\nnitive decline in the context of established Parkinson’s disease; by convention, the decline\nshould not reach the stage of major NCD until at least 1 year after Parkinson’s is diagnosed.\nIf less than a year has passed since the onset of motor symptoms, the diagnosis is NCDLB.\nThis distinction is clearer at the major NCD level than at the mild NCD level. \nThe timing and sequence of parkinsonism and mild NCD may be more difficult to de-\ntermine because the onset and clinical presentation can be ambiguous, and unspecified\nmild NCD should be diagnosed if the other core and suggestive features are absent.\nMajor or Mild Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder\n621\nComorbidity \nLewy body pathology frequently coexists with Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular\ndisease pathology, particularly among the oldest age groups. In Alzheimer’s disease, there\nis concomitant synuclein pathology in 60% of cases (if amygdala-restricted cases are in-\ncluded). In general, there is a higher rate of Lewy body pathology in individuals with de-\nmentia than in older individuals without dementia. \nMajor or Mild Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder\nDiagnostic Criteria\n \nA. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.\nB. The clinical features are consistent with a vascular etiology, as suggested by either of\nthe following: \n1. Onset of the cognitive deficits is temporally related to one or more cerebrovascular\nevents.\n2. Evidence for decline is prominent in complex attention (including processing\nspeed) and frontal-executive function.\nC. There is evidence of the presence of cerebrovascular disease from history, physical\nexamination, and\/or neuroimaging considered sufficient to account for the neurocog-\nnitive deficits. \nD. The symptoms are not better explained by another brain disease or systemic disorder.\nProbable vascular neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if one of the following is pres-\nent; otherwise possible vascular neurocognitive disorder should be diagnosed:\n1. Clinical criteria are supported by neuroimaging evidence of significant parenchymal in-\njury attributed to cerebrovascular disease (neuroimaging-supported).\n2. The neurocognitive syndrome is temporally related to one or more documented cere-\nbrovascular events.\n3. Both clinical and genetic (e.g., cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical\ninfarcts and leukoencephalopathy) evidence of cerebrovascular disease is present.\nPossible vascular neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if the clinical criteria are met\nbut neuroimaging is not available and the temporal relationship of the neurocognitive syn-\ndrome with one or more cerebrovascular events is not established.\nCoding note: For probable major vascular neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral dis-\nturbance, code 290.40 (F01.51). For probable major vascular neurocognitive disorder,\nwithout behavioral disturbance, code 290.40 (F01.50). For possible major vascular neuro-\ncognitive disorder, with or without behavioral disturbance, code 331.9 (G31.9). An addi-\ntional medical code for the cerebrovascular disease is not needed.\nFor mild vascular neurocognitive disorder, code 331.83 (G31.84). (Note: Do not use an\nadditional code for the vascular disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but\nshould still be indicated in writing.)\nDiagnostic Features\nThe diagnosis of major or mild vascular neurocognitive disorder (NCD) requires the es-\ntablishment of an NCD (Criterion A) and the determination that cerebrovascular disease is\nthe dominant if not exclusive pathology that accounts for the cognitive deficits (Criteria B\nand C). Vascular etiology may range from large vessel stroke to microvascular disease; the\n622\nNeurocognitive Disorders\npresentation is therefore very heterogeneous, stemming from the types of vascular lesions\nand their extent and location. The lesions may be focal, multifocal, or diffuse and occur in\nvarious combinations. \nMany individuals with major or mild vascular NCD present with multiple infarctions,\nwith an acute stepwise or fluctuating decline in cognition, and intervening periods of\nstability and even some improvement. Others may have gradual onset with slow pro-\ngression, a rapid development of deficits followed by relative stability, or another complex\npresentation. Major or mild vascular NCD with a gradual onset and slow progression is\ngenerally due to small vessel disease leading to lesions in the white matter, basal ganglia,\nand\/or thalamus. The gradual progression in these cases is often punctuated by acute\nevents that leave subtle neurological deficits. The cognitive deficits in these cases can be at-\ntributed to disruption of cortical-subcortical circuits, and complex attention, particularly\nspeed of information processing, and executive ability are likely to be affected.\nAssessing for the presence of sufficient cerebrovascular disease relies on history, phys-\nical examination, and neuroimaging (Criterion C). Etiological certainty requires the dem-\nonstration of abnormalities on neuroimaging. The lack of neuroimaging can result in\nsignificant diagnostic inaccuracy by overlooking “silent” brain infarction and white mat-\nter lesions. However, if the neurocognitive impairment is temporally associated with one\nor more well-documented strokes, a probable diagnosis can be made in the absence of neu-\nroimaging. Clinical evidence of cerebrovascular disease includes documented history of\nstroke, with cognitive decline temporally associated with the event, or physical signs con-\nsistent with stroke (e.g., hemiparesis; pseudobulbar syndrome, visual field defect). Neuro-\nimaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or computed tomography [CT]) evidence of\ncerebrovascular disease comprises one or more of the following: one or more large vessel\ninfarcts or hemorrhages, a strategically placed single infarct or hemorrhage (e.g., in angu-\nlar gyrus, thalamus, basal forebrain), two or more lacunar infarcts outside the brain stem,\nor extensive and confluent white matter lesions. The latter is often termed small vessel dis-\nease or subcortical ischemic changes on clinical neuroimaging evaluations.\nFor mild vascular NCD, history of a single stroke or extensive white matter disease is gen-\nerally sufficient. For major vascular NCD, two or more strokes, a strategically placed stroke,\nor a combination of white matter disease and one or more lacunes is generally necessary.\nThe disorder must not be better explained by another disorder. For example, promi-\nnent memory deficit early in the course might suggest Alzheimer's disease, early and\nprominent parkinsonian features would suggest Parkinson's disease, and a close associa-\ntion between onset and depression would suggest depression.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nA neurological assessment often reveals history of stroke and\/or transient ischemic epi-\nsodes, and signs indicative of brain infarctions. Also commonly associated are personality\nand mood changes, abulia, depression, and emotional lability. The development of late-\nonset depressive symptoms accompanied by psychomotor slowing and executive dys-\nfunction is a common presentation among older adults with progressive small vessel isch-\nemic disease (“vascular depression”).\nPrevalence\nMajor or mild vascular NCD is the second most common cause of NCD after Alzheimer’s\ndisease. In the United States, population prevalence estimates for vascular dementia range\nfrom 0.2% in the 65–70 years age group to 16% in individuals 80 years and older. Within\n3 months following stroke, 20%–30% of individuals are diagnosed with dementia. In neu-\nropathology series, the prevalence of vascular dementia increases from 13% at age 70 years\nto 44.6% at age 90 years or older, in comparison with Alzheimer’s disease (23.6%–51%) and\ncombined vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (2%–46.4%). Higher prevalence has\nMajor or Mild Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder\n623\nbeen reported in African Americans compared with Caucasians, and in East Asian countries\n(e.g., Japan, China). Prevalence is higher in males than in females.\nDevelopment and Course\nMajor or mild vascular NCD can occur at any age, although the prevalence increases ex-\nponentially after age 65 years. In older individuals, additional pathologies may partly ac-\ncount for the neurocognitive deficits. The course may vary from acute onset with partial\nimprovement to stepwise decline to progressive decline, with fluctuations and plateaus of\nvarying durations. Pure subcortical major or mild vascular NCD can have a slowly pro-\ngressive course that simulates major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nEnvironmental.\nThe neurocognitive outcomes of vascular brain injury are influenced by\nneuroplasticity factors such as education, physical exercise, and mental activity.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThe major risk factors for major or mild vascular NCD are the\nsame as those for cerebrovascular disease, including hypertension, diabetes, smoking, obesity,\nhigh cholesterol levels, high homocysteine levels, other risk factors for atherosclerosis and ar-\nteriolosclerosis, atrial fibrillation, and other conditions increasing the risk of cerebral emboli.\nCerebral amyloid angiopathy is an important risk factor in which amyloid deposits occur\nwithin arterial vessels. Another key risk factor is the hereditary condition cerebral autosomal\ndominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, or CADASIL.\nDiagnostic Markers\nStructural neuroimaging, using MRI or CT, has an important role in the diagnostic pro-\ncess. There are no other established biomarkers of major or mild vascular NCD. \nFunctional Consequences of \nMajor or Mild Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder\nMajor or mild vascular NCD is commonly associated with physical deficits that cause ad-\nditional disability. \nDifferential Diagnosis \nOther neurocognitive disorders.\nSince incidental brain infarctions and white matter le-\nsions are common in older individuals, it is important to consider other possible etiologies\nwhen an NCD is present. A history of memory deficit early in the course, and progressive\nworsening of memory, language, executive function, and perceptual-motor abilities in the\nabsence of corresponding focal lesions on brain imaging, are suggestive of Alzheimer’s\ndisease as the primary diagnosis. Potential biomarkers currently being validated for Alz-\nheimer’s disease, such as cerebrospinal fluid levels of beta-amyloid and phosphorylated\ntau, and amyloid imaging, may prove to be helpful in the differential diagnosis. NCD with\nLewy bodies is distinguished from major or mild vascular NCD by its core features of fluc-\ntuating cognition, visual hallucinations, and spontaneous parkinsonism. While deficits in\nexecutive function and language occur in major or mild vascular NCD, the insidious onset\nand gradual progression of behavioral features or language impairment are characteristic\nof frontotemporal NCD and are not typical of vascular etiology.\nOther medical conditions.\nA diagnosis of major or mild vascular NCD is not made if\nother diseases (e.g., brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, encephalitis, toxic or metabolic disor-\nders) are present and are of sufficient severity to account for the cognitive impairment.\n624\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nOther mental disorders.\nA diagnosis of major or mild vascular NCD is inappropriate if\nthe symptoms can be entirely attributed to delirium, although delirium may sometimes be\nsuperimposed on a preexisting major or mild vascular NCD, in which case both diagnoses\ncan be made. If the criteria for major depressive disorder are met and the cognitive impair-\nment is temporally related to the likely onset of the depression, major or mild vascular\nNCD should not be diagnosed. However, if the NCD preceded the development of the de-\npression, or the severity of the cognitive impairment is out of proportion to the severity of\nthe depression, both should be diagnosed. \nComorbidity\nMajor or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease commonly co-occurs with major or mild\nvascular NCD, in which case both diagnoses should be made. Major or mild vascular NCD\nand depression frequently co-occur. \nMajor or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder\nDue to Traumatic Brain Injury\nDiagnostic Criteria\n \nA. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.\nB. There is evidence of a traumatic brain injury—that is, an impact to the head or other\nmechanisms of rapid movement or displacement of the brain within the skull, with one\nor more of the following: \n1. Loss of consciousness.\n2. Posttraumatic amnesia.\n3. Disorientation and confusion.\n4. Neurological signs (e.g., neuroimaging demonstrating injury; a new onset of sei-\nzures; a marked worsening of a preexisting seizure disorder; visual field cuts; an-\nosmia; hemiparesis).\nC. The neurocognitive disorder presents immediately after the occurrence of the trau-\nmatic brain injury or immediately after recovery of consciousness and persists past the\nacute post-injury period.\nCoding note: For major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, with behavioral\ndisturbance: For ICD-9-CM, first code 907.0 late effect of intracranial injury without skull frac-\nture, followed by 294.11 major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, with be-\nhavioral disturbance. For ICD-10-CM, first code S06.2X9S diffuse traumatic brain injury with\nloss of consciousness of unspecified duration, sequela; followed by F02.81 major neurocog-\nnitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, with behavioral disturbance.\nFor major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, without behavioral distur-\nbance: For ICD-9-CM, first code 907.0 late effect of intracranial injury without skull fracture,\nfollowed by 294.10 major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, without be-\nhavioral disturbance. For ICD-10-CM, first code S06.2X9S diffuse traumatic brain injury with\nloss of consciousness of unspecified duration, sequela; followed by F02.80 major neurocog-\nnitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, without behavioral disturbance.\nFor mild neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, code 331.83 (G31.84).\n(Note: Do not use the additional code for traumatic brain injury. Behavioral disturbance\ncannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.)\nMajor or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury\n625\nSpecifiers\nRate the severity of the neurocognitive disorder (NCD), not the underlying traumatic brain\ninjury (see the section “Development and Course” for this disorder).\nDiagnostic Features\nMajor or mild NCD due to traumatic brain injury (TBI) is caused by an impact to the head,\nor other mechanisms of rapid movement or displacement of the brain within the skull, as\ncan happen with blast injuries. Traumatic brain injury is defined as brain trauma with spe-\ncific characteristics that include at least one of the following: loss of consciousness, post-\ntraumatic amnesia, disorientation and confusion, or, in more severe cases, neurological\nsigns (e.g., positive neuroimaging, a new onset of seizures or a marked worsening of a pre-\nexisting seizure disorder, visual field cuts, anosmia, hemiparesis) (Criterion B). To be at-\ntributable to TBI, the NCD must present either immediately after the brain injury occurs or\nimmediately after the individual recovers consciousness after the injury and persist past\nthe acute post-injury period (Criterion C). \nThe cognitive presentation is variable. Difficulties in the domains of complex attention,\nexecutive ability, learning, and memory are common as well as slowing in speed of infor-\nmation processing and disturbances in social cognition. In more severe TBI in which there\nis brain contusion, intracranial hemorrhage, or penetrating injury, there may be additional\nneurocognitive deficits, such as aphasia, neglect, and constructional dyspraxia.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nMajor or mild NCD due to TBI may be accompanied by disturbances in emotional function\n(e.g., irritability, easy frustration, tension and anxiety, affective lability); personality\nchanges (e.g., disinhibition, apathy, suspiciousness, aggression); physical disturbances\n(e.g., headache, fatigue, sleep disorders, vertigo or dizziness, tinnitus or hyperacusis, pho-\ntosensitivity, anosmia, reduced tolerance to psychotropic medications); and, particularly\nin more severe TBI, neurological symptoms and signs (e.g., seizures, hemiparesis, visual\ndisturbances, cranial nerve deficits) and evidence of orthopedic injuries.\nPrevalence\nIn the United States, 1.7 million TBIs occur annually, resulting in 1.4 million emergency de-\npartment visits, 275,000 hospitalizations, and 52,000 deaths. About 2% of the population\nlives with TBI-associated disability. Males account for 59% of TBIs in the United States.\nThe most common etiologies of TBI in the United States are falls, vehicular accidents, and\nbeing struck on the head. Collisions and blows to the head that occur in the course of con-\ntact sports are increasingly recognized as sources of mild TBI, with a concern that repeated\nmild TBI may have cumulatively persisting sequelae.\nDevelopment and Course\nThe severity of a TBI is rated at the time of injury\/initial assessment as mild, moderate, or\nsevere according to the thresholds in Table 2.\nThe severity rating of the TBI itself does not necessarily correspond to the severity of\nthe resulting NCD. The course of recovery from TBI is variable, depending not only on the\nspecifics of the injury but also on cofactors, such as age, prior history of brain damage, or\nsubstance abuse, that may favor or impede recovery. \n626\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nNeurobehavioral symptoms tend to be most severe in the immediate aftermath of the\nTBI. Except in the case of severe TBI, the typical course is that of complete or substantial\nimprovement in associated neurocognitive, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms and\nsigns. Neurocognitive symptoms associated with mild TBI tend to resolve within days to\nweeks after the injury with complete resolution typical by 3 months. Other symptoms that\nmay potentially co-occur with the neurological symptoms (e.g., depression, irritability,\nfatigue, headache, photosensitivity, sleep disturbance) also tend to resolve in the weeks\nfollowing mild TBI. Substantial subsequent deterioration in these areas should trigger con-\nsideration of additional diagnoses. However, repeated mild TBI may be associated with\npersisting neurocognitive disturbance. \nWith moderate and severe TBI, in addition to persistence of neurocognitive deficits,\nthere may be associated neurophysiological, emotional, and behavioral complications.\nThese include seizures (particularly in the first year), photosensitivity, hyperacusis, irritabil-\nity, aggression, depression, sleep disturbance, fatigue, apathy, inability to resume occu-\npational and social functioning at pre-injury level, and deterioration in interpersonal\nrelationships. Moderate and severe TBI have been associated with increased risk of depres-\nsion, aggression, and possibly neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.\nThe features of persisting major or mild NCD due to TBI will vary by age, specifics of\nthe injury, and cofactors. Persisting TBI-related impairment in an infant or child may be re-\nflected in delays in reaching developmental milestones (e.g., language acquisition), worse\nacademic performance, and possibly impaired social development. Among older teenag-\ners and adults, persisting symptoms may include various neurocognitive deficits, irrita-\nbility, hypersensitivity to light and sound, easy fatigability, and mood changes, including\ndepression, anxiety, hostility, or apathy. In older individuals with depleted cognitive re-\nserve, mild TBI is more likely to result in incomplete recoveries.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nRisk factors for traumatic brain injury.\nTraumatic brain injury rates vary by age, with\nthe highest prevalence among individuals younger than 4 years, older adolescents, and in-\ndividuals older than 65 years. Falls are the most common cause of TBI, with motor vehicle\naccidents being second. Sports concussions are frequent causes of TBI in older children,\nteenagers, and young adults.\nRisk factors for neurocognitive disorder after traumatic brain injury.\nRepeated con-\ncussions can lead to persistent NCD and neuropathological evidence of traumatic enceph-\nalopathy. Co-occurring intoxication with a substance may increase the severity of a TBI\nfrom a motor vehicle accident, but whether intoxication at the time of injury worsens neu-\nrocognitive outcome is unknown.\nCourse modifiers.\nMild TBI generally resolves within a few weeks to months, although res-\nolution may be delayed or incomplete in the context of repeated TBI.

Magnetic resonance image scanning\nmay also reveal hyperintensities suggestive of microhemorrhages. \nFunctional Consequences of Major or Mild \nNeurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury \nWith mild NCD due to TBI, individuals may report reduced cognitive efficiency, difficulty\nconcentrating, and lessened ability to perform usual activities. With major NCD due to TBI, an\nindividual may have difficulty in independent living and self-care. Prominent neuromotor\nfeatures, such as severe incoordination, ataxia, and motor slowing, may be present in major\nNCD due to TBI and may add to functional difficulties. Individuals with TBI histories report\nmore depressive symptoms, and these can amplify cognitive complaints and worsen func-\ntional outcome. Additionally, loss of emotional control, including aggressive or inappropriate\naffect and apathy, may be present after more severe TBI with greater neurocognitive impair-\nment. These features may compound difficulties with independent living and self-care.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nIn some instances, severity of neurocognitive symptoms may appear to be inconsistent\nwith the severity of the TBI. After previously undetected neurological complications (e.g.,\nchronic hematoma) are excluded, the possibility of diagnoses such as somatic symptom\ndisorder or factitious disorder need to be considered. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\ncan co-occur with the NCD and have overlapping symptoms (e.g., difficulty concentrat-\ning, depressed mood, aggressive behavioral disinhibition).\nComorbidity\nAmong individuals with substance use disorders, the neurocognitive effects of the sub-\nstance contribute to or compound the TBI-associated neurocognitive change. Some symp-\ntoms associated with TBI may overlap with symptoms found in cases of PTSD, and the two\ndisorders may co-occur, especially in military populations. \nSubstance\/Medication-Induced\n Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder\nDiagnostic Criteria\nA. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.\nB. The neurocognitive impairments do not occur exclusively during the course of a delir-\nium and persist beyond the usual duration of intoxication and acute withdrawal.\nC. The involved substance or medication and duration and extent of use are capable of\nproducing the neurocognitive impairment.\nD. The temporal course of the neurocognitive deficits is consistent with the timing of sub-\nstance or medication use and abstinence (e.g., the deficits remain stable or improve\nafter a period of abstinence).\n628\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nE. The neurocognitive disorder is not attributable to another medical condition or is not\nbetter explained by another mental disorder.\nCoding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance\/medica-\ntion]-induced neurocognitive disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-\n10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present\nfor the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the sub-\nstance-induced neurocognitive disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician\nshould record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced neurocognitive\ndisorder (e.g., “mild inhalant use disorder with inhalant-induced major neurocognitive disor-\nder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-\ninduced neurocognitive disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should\nrecord “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending\non the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance\nuse disorder, then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the\nsubstance-induced neurocognitive disorder. For some classes of substances (i.e., alcohol;\nsedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics), it is not permissible to code a comorbid mild substance\nuse disorder with a substance-induced neurocognitive disorder; only a comorbid moderate\nor severe substance use disorder, or no substance use disorder, can be diagnosed. Behav-\nioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.\nICD-10-CM\nICD-9-CM\nWith use \ndisorder, \nmild\nWith use \ndisorder, \nmoderate or \nsevere\nWithout use \ndisorder\nAlcohol (major neurocognitive \ndisorder), nonamnestic- \nconfabulatory type\n291.2\nNA\nF10.27\nF10.97\nAlcohol (major neurocognitive \ndisorder), amnestic- \nconfabulatory type\n291.1\nNA\nF10.26\nF10.96\nAlcohol (mild neurocognitive \ndisorder)\n291.89\nNA\nF10.288\nF10.988\nInhalant (major neurocognitive \ndisorder)\n292.82\nF18.17\nF18.27\nF18.97\nInhalant (mild neurocognitive \ndisorder)\n292.89\nF18.188\nF18.288\nF18.988\nSedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic \n(major neurocognitive disorder)\n292.82\nNA\nF13.27\nF13.97\nSedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic \n(mild neurocognitive disorder)\n292.89\nNA\nF13.288\nF13.988\nOther (or unknown) substance \n(major neurocognitive disorder)\n292.82\nF19.17\nF19.27\nF19.97\nOther (or unknown) substance \n(mild neurocognitive disorder)\n292.89\nF19.188\nF19.288\nF19.988\nSubstance\/Medication-Induced Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder\n629\nSpecify if: \nPersistent: Neurocognitive impairment continues to be significant after an extended\nperiod of abstinence.\nRecording Procedures\nICD-9-CM.\nThe name of the substance\/medication-induced neurocognitive disorder be-\ngins with the specific substance\/medication (e.g., alcohol) that is presumed to be causing\nthe neurocognitive symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in\nthe criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of\nthe classes, the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance\nis judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the cat-\negory “unknown substance” should be used.\nThe name of the disorder (i.e., [specific substance]-induced major neurocognitive dis-\norder or [specific substance]-induced mild neurocognitive disorder) is followed by the\ntype in the case of alcohol (i.e., nonamnestic-confabulatory type, amnestic-confabulatory\ntype), followed by specification of duration (i.e., persistent). Unlike the recording procedures\nfor ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance\/medication-induced disorder and sub-\nstance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for\nthe substance use disorder. For example, in the case of persistent amnestic-confabulatory\nsymptoms in a man with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is 291.1 alcohol-\ninduced major neurocognitive disorder, amnestic-confabulatory type, persistent. An addi-\ntional diagnosis of 303.90 severe alcohol use disorder is also given. If the substance\/medi-\ncation-induced neurocognitive disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder\n(e.g., after a sporadic heavy use of inhalants), no accompanying substance use disorder is\nnoted (e.g., 292.82 inhalant-induced mild neurocognitive disorder). \nICD-10-CM.\nThe name of the substance\/medication-induced neurocognitive disorder\nbegins with the specific substance (e.g., alcohol) that is presumed to be causing the neuro-\ncognitive symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria\nset, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use\ndisorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes, the code for “other sub-\nstance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological fac-\ntor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance”\nshould be used.\nWhen recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is\nlisted first, followed by the word “with,” followed by the name of the disorder (i.e., [specific\nsubstance]-induced major neurocognitive disorder or [specific substance]-induced mild\nneurocognitive disorder), followed by the type in the case of alcohol (i.e., nonamnestic-con-\nfabulatory type, amnestic-confabulatory type), followed by specification of duration (i.e.,\npersistent). For example, in the case of persistent amnestic-confabulatory symptoms in a\nman with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is F10.26 severe alcohol use disorder\nwith alcohol-induced major neurocognitive disorder, amnestic-confabulatory type, persis-\ntent. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe alcohol use disorder is not given. If the\nsubstance-induced neurocognitive disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use dis-\norder (e.g., after a sporadic heavy use of inhalants), no accompanying substance use disor-\nder is noted (e.g., F18.988 inhalant-induced mild neurocognitive disorder).\nDiagnostic Features \nSubstance\/medication-induced major or mild NCD is characterized by neurocognitive\nimpairments that persist beyond the usual duration of intoxication and acute withdrawal\n(Criterion B). Initially, these manifestations can reflect slow recovery of brain functions\nfrom a period of prolonged substance use, and improvements in neurocognitive as well as\n630\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nbrain imaging indicators may be seen over many months. If the disorder continues for an\nextended period, persistent should be specified. The given substance and its use must be\nknown to be capable of causing the observed impairments (Criterion C). While nonspecific\ndecrements in a range of cognitive abilities can occur with nearly any substance of abuse\nand a variety of medications, some patterns occur more frequently with selected drug\nclasses. For example, NCD due to sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drugs (e.g., benzodiaz-\nepines, barbiturates) may show greater disturbances in memory than in other cognitive\nfunctions. NCD induced by alcohol frequently manifests with a combination of impair-\nments in executive-function and memory and learning domains. The temporal course of\nthe substance-induced NCD must be consistent with that of use of the given substance\n(Criterion D). In alcohol-induced amnestic confabulatory (Korsakoff’s) NCD, the features\ninclude prominent amnesia (severe difficulty learning new information with rapid forget-\nting) and a tendency to confabulate. These manifestations may co-occur with signs of thi-\namine encephalopathy (Wernicke’s encephalopathy) with associated features such as\nnystagmus and ataxia. Ophthalmoplegia of Wernicke’s encephalopathy is typically charac-\nterized by a lateral gaze paralysis.\nIn addition to or independent of the more common neurocognitive symptoms related\nto methamphetamine use (e.g., difficulties with learning and memory; executive func-\ntion), methamphetamine use can also be associated with evidence of vascular injury (e.g.,\nfocal weakness, unilateral incoordination, asymmetrical reflexes). The most common neu-\nrocognitive profile approximates that seen in vascular NCD. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIntermediate-duration NCD induced by drugs with central nervous system depressant effects\nmay manifest with added symptoms of increased irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and\ndysphoria. Intermediate-duration NCD induced by stimulant drugs may manifest with re-\nbound depression, hypersomnia, and apathy. In severe forms of substance\/medication-\ninduced major NCD (e.g., associated with long-term alcohol use), there may be prominent\nneuromotor features, such as incoordination, ataxia, and motor slowing. There may also be\nloss of emotional control, including aggressive or inappropriate affect, or apathy.\nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of these conditions is not known. Prevalence figures for substance abuse are\navailable, and substance\/medication-induced major or mild NCDs are more likely in those\nwho are older, have longer use, and have other risk factors such as nutritional deficits.\nFor alcohol abuse, the rate of mild NCD of intermediate duration is approximately 30%–\n40% in the first 2 months of abstinence. Mild NCD may persist, particularly in those who do\nnot achieve stable abstinence until after age 50 years. Major NCD is rare and may result from\nconcomitant nutritional deficits, as in alcohol-induced amnestic confabulatory NCD.\nFor individuals quitting cocaine, methamphetamine, opioids, phencyclidine, and sed-\native, hypnotics, or anxiolytics, substance\/medication-induced mild NCD of intermediate\nduration may occur in one-third or more, and there is some evidence that these substances\nmay also be associated with persistent mild NCD. Major NCD associated with these sub-\nstances is rare, if it occurs at all. In the case of methamphetamine, cerebrovascular disease\ncan also occur, resulting in diffuse or focal brain injury that can be of mild or major neu-\nrocognitive levels. Solvent exposure has been linked to both major and mild NCD of both\nintermediate and persistent duration. \nThe presence of NCD induced by cannabis and various hallucinogens is controversial.\nWith cannabis, intoxication is accompanied by various neurocognitive disturbances, but\nthese tend to clear with abstinence. \nSubstance\/Medication-Induced Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder\n631\nDevelopment and Course\nSubstance use disorders tend to commence during adolescence and peak in the 20s and\n30s. Although longer history of severe substance use disorder is associated with greater\nlikelihood of NCD, the relationships are not straightforward, with substantial and even\ncomplete recovery of neurocognitive functions being common among individuals who\nachieve stable abstinence prior to age 50 years. Substance\/medication-induced major or\nmild NCD is most likely to become persistent in individuals who continue abuse of sub-\nstances past age 50 years, presumably because of a combination of lessened neural plas-\nticity and beginnings of other age-related brain changes. Earlier commencement of abuse,\nparticularly of alcohol, may lead to defects in later neural development (e.g., later stages of\nmaturation of frontal circuitries), which may have effects on social cognition as well as\nother neurocognitive abilities. For alcohol-induced NCD, there may be an additive effect\nof aging and alcohol-induced brain injury.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nRisk factors for substance\/medication-induced NCDs include older age, longer use, and\npersistent use past age 50 years. In addition, for alcohol-induced NCD, long-term nutri-\ntional deficiencies, liver disease, vascular risk factors, and cardiovascular and cerebrovas-\ncular disease may contribute to risk. \nDiagnostic Markers\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of individuals with chronic alcohol abuse frequently\nreveals cortical thinning, white matter loss, and enlargement of sulci and ventricles. While\nneuroimaging abnormalities are more common in those with NCDs, it is possible to ob-\nserve NCDs without neuroimaging abnormalities, and vice versa. Specialized techniques\n(e.g., diffusion tensor imaging) may reveal damage to specific white matter tracts. Mag-\nnetic resonance spectroscopy may reveal reduction in N-acetylaspartate, and increase in\nmarkers of inflammation (e.g., myoinositol) or white matter injury (e.g., choline). Many of\nthese brain imaging changes and neurocognitive manifestations reverse following suc-\ncessful abstinence. In individuals with methamphetamine use disorder, MRI may also re-\nveal hyperintensities suggestive of microhemorrhages or larger areas of infarction.\nFunctional Consequences of Substance\/Medication-\nInduced Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder\nThe functional consequences of substance\/medication-induced mild NCD are sometimes\naugmented by reduced cognitive efficiency and difficulty concentrating beyond that seen\nin many other NCDs. In addition, at both major and mild levels, substance\/medication-\ninduced NCDs may have associated motor syndromes that increase the level of functional\nimpairment. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nIndividuals with substance use disorders, substance intoxication, and substance withdrawal\nare at increased risk for other conditions that may independently, or through a compounding\neffect, result in neurocognitive disturbance. These include history of traumatic brain injury\nand infections that can accompany substance use disorder (e.g., HIV, hepatitis C virus, syph-\nilis). Therefore, presence of substance\/medication-induced major or mild NCD should be\ndifferentiated from NCDs arising outside the context of substance use, intoxication, and with-\ndrawal, including these accompanying conditions (e.g., traumatic brain injury).\n632\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nComorbidity\nSubstance use disorders, substance intoxication, and substance withdrawal are highly co-\nmorbid with other mental disorders. Comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder, psychotic\ndisorders, depressive and bipolar disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders can con-\ntribute to neurocognitive impairment in substance users. Traumatic brain injury occurs\nmore frequently with substance use, complicating efforts to determine the etiology of NCD\nin such cases. Severe, long-term alcohol use disorder can be associated with major organ\nsystem disease, including cerebrovascular disease and cirrhosis. Amphetamine-induced\nNCD may be accompanied by major or mild vascular NCD, also secondary to amphet-\namine use.\nMajor or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder\n Due to HIV Infection\nDiagnostic Criteria\n \nA. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.\nB. There is documented infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\nC. The neurocognitive disorder is not better explained by non-HIV conditions, including\nsecondary brain diseases such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or\ncryptococcal meningitis.\nD. The neurocognitive disorder is not attributable to another medical condition and is not\nbetter explained by a mental disorder.\nCoding note: For major neurocognitive disorder due to HIV infection, with behavioral dis-\nturbance, code first 042 (B20) HIV infection, followed by 294.11 (F02.81) major neurocog-\nnitive disorder due to HIV infection, with behavioral disturbance. For major neurocognitive\ndisorder due to HIV infection, without behavioral disturbance, code first 042 (B20) HIV in-\nfection, followed by 294.10 (F02.80) major neurocognitive disorder due to HIV infection,\nwithout behavioral disturbance.\nFor mild neurocognitive disorder due to HIV infection, code 331.83 (G31.84). (Note: Do\nnot use the additional code for HIV infection. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but\nshould still be indicated in writing.)\nDiagnostic Features \nHIV disease is caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1),\nwhich is acquired through exposure to bodily fluids of an infected person through injection\ndrug use, unprotected sexual contact, or accidental or iatrogenic exposure (e.g., contami-\nnated blood supply, needle puncture injury to medical personnel). HIV infects several types\nof cells, most particularly immune cells. Over time, the infection can cause severe depletion\nof “T-helper” (CD4) lymphocytes, resulting in severe immunocompromise, often leading to\nopportunistic infections and neoplasms. This advanced form of HIV infection is termed\nacquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Diagnosis of HIV is confirmed by established\nlaboratory methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV antibody with\nWestern blot confirmation and\/or polymerase chain reaction–based assays for HIV. \nSome individuals with HIV infection develop an NCD, which generally shows a “sub-\ncortical pattern” with prominently impaired executive function, slowing of processing\nspeed, problems with more demanding attentional tasks, and difficulty in learning new\ninformation, but fewer problems with recall of learned information. In major NCD, slow-\ning may be prominent. Language difficulties, such as aphasia, are uncommon, although\nreductions in fluency may be observed. HIV pathogenic processes can affect any part of\nthe brain; therefore, other patterns are possible. \nMajor or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to HIV Infection\n633\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nMajor or mild NCD due to HIV infection is usually more prevalent in individuals with\nprior episodes of severe immunosuppression, high viral loads in the cerebrospinal fluid,\nand indicators of advanced HIV disease such as anemia and hypoalbuminemia. Individ-\nuals with advanced NCD may experience prominent neuromotor features such as severe\nincoordination, ataxia, and motor slowing. There may be loss of emotional control, includ-\ning aggressive or inappropriate affect or apathy. \nPrevalence\nDepending on stage of HIV disease, approximately one-third to over one-half of HIV-\ninfected individuals have at least mild neurocognitive disturbance, but some of these dis-\nturbances may not meet the full criteria for mild NCD. An estimated 25% of individuals\nwith HIV will have signs and symptoms that meet criteria for mild NCD, and in fewer than\n5% would criteria for major NCD be met. \nDevelopment and Course \nAn NCD due to HIV infection can resolve, improve, slowly worsen, or have a fluctuating\ncourse. Rapid progression to profound neurocognitive impairment is uncommon in the\ncontext of currently available combination antiviral treatment; consequently, an abrupt\nchange in mental status in an individual with HIV may prompt an evaluation of other\nmedical sources for the cognitive change, including secondary infections. Because HIV in-\nfection preferentially affects subcortical regions over the course of illness, including deep\nwhite matter, the progression of the disorder follows a “subcortical” pattern. Since HIV\ncan affect a variety of brain regions, and the illness can take on many different trajectories\ndepending on associated comorbidities and consequences of HIV, the overall course of an\nNCD due to HIV infection has considerable heterogeneity. A subcortical neurocognitive\nprofile may interact with age over the life course, when psychomotor slowing and motor\nimpairments such as slowed gait may occur as a consequence of other age-related condi-\ntions so that the overall progression may appear more pronounced in later life. \nIn developed countries, HIV disease is primarily a condition of adults, with acquisition\nvia risky behaviors (e.g., unprotected sex, injection drug use) beginning in late adolescence\nand peaking during young and middle adulthood. In developing countries, particularly\nsub-Saharan Africa, where HIV testing and antiretroviral treatments for pregnant women\nare not readily available, perinatal transmission is common. The NCD in such infants and\nchildren may present primarily as neurodevelopmental delay. As individuals treated for\nHIV survive into older age, additive and interactive neurocognitive effects of HIV and\naging, including other NCDs (e.g., due to Alzheimer’s disease, due to Parkinson’s dis-\nease), are possible. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nRisk and prognostic factors for HIV infection.\nRisk factors for HIV infection include injec-\ntion drug use, unprotected sex, and unprotected blood supply and other iatrogenic factors. \nRisk and prognostic factors for major or mild neurocognitive disorder due to HIV in-\nfection.\nParadoxically, NCD due to HIV infection has not declined significantly with the\nadvent of combined antiretroviral therapy, although the most severe presentations (con-\nsistent with the diagnosis of major NCD) have decreased sharply. Contributory factors\nmay include inadequate control of HIV in the central nervous system (CNS), the evolution\nof drug-resistant viral strains, the effects of chronic long-term systemic and brain inflam-\nmation, and the effects of comorbid factors such as aging, drug abuse, past history of CNS\ntrauma, and co-infections, such as with the hepatitis C virus. Chronic exposure to antiret-\nroviral drugs also raises the possibility of neurotoxicity, although this has not been defin-\nitively established. \n634\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nDiagnostic Markers\nSerum HIV testing is required for the diagnosis. In addition, HIV characterization of the cere-\nbrospinal fluid may be helpful if it reveals a disproportionately high viral load in cerebrospinal\nfluid versus in the plasma. Neuroimaging (i.e., magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) may reveal\nreduction in total brain volume, cortical thinning, reduction in white matter volume, and\npatchy areas of abnormal white matter (hyperintensities). MRI or lumbar puncture may be\nhelpful to exclude a specific medical condition such as cryptococcus infection or herpes en-\ncephalitis that may contribute to CNS changes in the context of AIDS. Specialized techniques\nsuch as diffusion tensor imaging may reveal damage to specific white matter tracts. \nFunctional Consequences of Major or Mild \nNeurocognitive Disorder Due to HIV Infection\nFunctional consequences of major or mild NCD due to HIV infection are variable across\nindividuals. Thus, impaired executive abilities and slowed information processing may\nsubstantially interfere with the complex disease management decisions required for ad-\nherence to the combined antiretroviral therapy regimen. The likelihood of comorbid dis-\nease may further create functional challenges. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nIn the presence of comorbidities, such as other infections (e.g., hepatitis C virus, syphilis),\ndrug abuse (e.g., methamphetamine abuse), or prior head injury or neurodevelopmental\nconditions, major or mild NCD due to HIV infection can be diagnosed provided there is ev-\nidence that infection with HIV has worsened any NCDs due to such preexisting or comorbid\nconditions. Among older adults, onset of neurocognitive decline related to cerebrovascular\ndisease or neurodegeneration (e.g., major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease) may\nneed to be differentiated. In general, stable, fluctuating (without progression) or improving\nneurocognitive status would favor an HIV etiology, whereas steady or stepwise deter-\nioration would suggest neurodegenerative or vascular etiology. Because more severe im-\nmunodeficiency can result in opportunistic infections of the brain (e.g., toxoplasmosis;\ncryptococcosis) and neoplasia (e.g., CNS lymphoma), sudden onset of an NCD or sudden\nworsening of that disorder demands active investigation of non-HIV etiologies.\nComorbidity\nHIV disease is accompanied by chronic systemic and neuro-inflammation that can be as-\nsociated with cerebrovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. These complications can\nbe part of the pathogenesis of major or mild NCD due to HIV infection. HIV frequently co-\noccurs with conditions such as substance use disorders when the substance has been in-\njected and other sexually transmitted disorders. \nMajor or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder\n Due to Prion Disease\nDiagnostic Criteria\n \nA. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.\nB. There is insidious onset, and rapid progression of impairment is common.\nC. There are motor features of prion disease, such as myoclonus or ataxia, or biomarker\nevidence.\nMajor or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Prion Disease\n635\nD. The neurocognitive disorder is not attributable to another medical condition and is not\nbetter explained by another mental disorder.\nCoding note: For major neurocognitive disorder due to prion disease, with behavioral dis-\nturbance, code first 046.79 (A81.9) prion disease, followed by 294.11 (F02.81) major\nneurocognitive disorder due to prion disease, with behavioral disturbance. For major neu-\nrocognitive disorder due to prion disease, without behavioral disturbance, code first\n046.79 (A81.9) prion disease, followed by 294.10 (F02.80) major neurocognitive disorder\ndue to prion disease, without behavioral disturbance.\nFor mild neurocognitive disorder due to prion disease, code 331.83 (G31.84). (Note: Do\nnot use the additional code for prion disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but\nshould still be indicated in writing.)\nDiagnostic Features\nThe classification of major or mild neurocognitive disorder (NCD) due to prion disease in-\ncludes NCDs due to a group of subacute spongiform encephalopathies (including Creutz-\nfeldt-Jakob disease, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, kuru, Gerstmann-Sträussler-\nScheinker syndrome, and fatal insomnia) caused by transmissible agents known as prions.\nThe most common type is sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, typically referred to as\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Variant CJD is much rarer and is associated with trans-\nmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, also called “mad cow disease.” Typically,\nindividuals with CJD present with neurocognitive deficits, ataxia, and abnormal move-\nments such as myoclonus, chorea, or dystonia; a startle reflex is also common. Typically,\nthe history reveals rapid progression to major NCD over as little as 6 months, and thus the\ndisorder is typically seen only at the major level. However, many individuals with the dis-\norder may have atypical presentations, and the disease can be confirmed only by biopsy or\nat autopsy. Individuals with variant CJD may present with a greater preponderance of\npsychiatric symptoms, characterized a by low mood, withdrawal, and anxiety. Prion dis-\nease is typically not diagnosed without at least one of the characteristic biomarker fea-\ntures: recognized lesions on magnetic resonance imaging with DWI (diffusion-weighted\nimaging) or FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery), tau or 14-3-3 protein in cerebro-\nspinal fluid, characteristic triphasic waves on electroencephalogram, or, for rare familial\nforms, family history or genetic testing. \nPrevalence\nThe annual incidence of sporadic CJD is approximately one or two cases per million peo-\nple. Prevalence is unknown but very low given the short survival.\nDevelopment and Course\nPrion disease may develop at any age in adults—the peak age for the sporadic CJD is ap-\nproximately 67 years—although it has been reported to occur in individuals spanning the\nteenage years to late life. Prodromal symptoms of prion disease may include fatigue, anx-\niety, problems with appetite or sleeping, or difficulties with concentration. After several\nweeks, these symptoms may be followed by incoordination, altered vision, or abnormal\ngait or other movements that may be myoclonic, choreoathetoid, or ballistic, along with a\nrapidly progressive dementia. The disease typically progresses very rapidly to the major\nlevel of impairment over several months. More rarely, it can progress over 2 years and ap-\npear similar in its course to other NCDs.\n636\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nRisk Factors and Prognosis\nEnvironmental.\nCross-species transmission of prion infections, with agents that are\nclosely related to the human form, has been demonstrated (e.g., the outbreak of bovine\nspongiform encephalopathy inducing variant CJD in the United Kingdom during the mid-\n1990s). Transmission by corneal transplantation and by human growth factor injection has\nbeen documented, and anecdotal cases of transmission to health care workers have been\nreported.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThere is a genetic component in up to 15% of cases, associ-\nated with an autosomal dominant mutation.\nDiagnostic Markers\nPrion disease can be definitively confirmed only by biopsy or at autopsy. Although there are\nno distinctive findings on cerebrospinal fluid analysis across the prion diseases, reliable bio-\nmarkers are being developed and include 14-3-3 protein (particularly for sporadic CJD) as\nwell as tau protein. Magnetic resonance brain imaging is currently considered the most sen-\nsitive diagnostic test when DWI is performed, with the most common finding being multi-\nfocal gray matter hyperintensities in subcortical and cortical regions. In some individuals,\nthe electroencephalogram reveals periodic sharp, often triphasic and synchronous dis-\ncharges at a rate of 0.5–2 Hz at some point during the course of the disorder. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther major neurocognitive disorders.\nMajor NCD due to prion disease may appear\nsimilar in its course to other NCDs, but prion diseases are typically distinguished by their\nrapid progression and prominent cerebellar and motor symptoms."}

(Note: Do not use the additional code for Alzheimer’s disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) Diagnostic Features Beyond the neurocognitive disorder (NCD) syndrome (Criterion A), the core features of ma- jor or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease include an insidious onset and gradual pro- gression of cognitive and behavioral symptoms (Criterion B). The typical presentation is amnestic (i.e., with impairment in memory and learning). Unusual nonamnestic presen- tations, particularly visuospatial and logopenic aphasic variants, also exist. At the mild NCD phase, Alzheimer’s disease manifests typically with impairment in memory and learn- ing, sometimes accompanied by deficits in executive function. At the major NCD phase, visuoconstructional/perceptual-motor ability and language will also be impaired, partic- ularly when the NCD is moderate to severe. Social cognition tends to be preserved until late in the course of the disease. A level of diagnostic certainty must be specified denoting Alzheimer’s disease as the “probable” or “possible” etiology (Criterion C). Probable Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed in both major and mild NCD if there is evidence of a causative Alzheimer’s disease gene, ei- ther from genetic testing or from an autosomal dominant family history coupled with au- topsy confirmation or a genetic test in an affected family member. For major NCD, a typical clinical picture, without extended plateaus or evidence of mixed etiology, can also be diagnosed as due to probable Alzheimer’s disease. For mild NCD, given the lesser de- gree of certainty that the deficits will progress, these features are only sufficient for a possible Alzheimer’s etiology. If the etiology appears mixed, mild NCD due to multiple eti- ologies should be diagnosed. In any case, for both mild and major NCD due to Alzhei- mer’s disease, the clinical features must not suggest another primary etiology for the NCD (Criterion D). Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis In specialty clinical settings, approximately 80% of individuals with major NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease have behavioral and psychological manifestations; these features are also frequent at the mild NCD stage of impairment. These symptoms are as or more dis- tressing than cognitive manifestations and are frequently the reason that health care is sought. At the mild NCD stage or the mildest level of major NCD, depression and/or ap- athy are often seen. With moderately severe major NCD, psychotic features, irritability, agitation, combativeness, and wandering are common. Late in the illness, gait distur- bance, dysphagia, incontinence, myoclonus, and seizures are observed. Prevalence The prevalence of overall dementia (major NCD) rises steeply with age. In high-income countries, it ranges from 5% to 10% in the seventh decade to at least 25% thereafter. U.S. census data estimates suggest that approximately 7% of individuals diagnosed with Alz- heimer’s disease are between ages 65 and 74 years, 53% are between ages 75 and 84 years, and 40% are 85 years and older. The percentage of dementias attributable to Alzheimer’s disease ranges from about 60% to over 90%, depending on the setting and diagnostic cri- teria. Mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease is likely to represent a substantial fraction of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well. Development and Course Major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease progresses gradually, sometimes with brief plateaus, through severe dementia to death. The mean duration of survival after di- Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer’s Disease 613 agnosis is approximately 10 years, reflecting the advanced age of the majority of individ- uals rather than the course of the disease; some individuals can live with the disease for as long as 20 years. Late-stage individuals are eventually mute and bedbound. Death most commonly results from aspiration in those who survive through the full course. In mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease, impairments increase over time, and functional status gradually declines until symptoms reach the threshold for the diagnosis of major NCD. The onset of symptoms is usually in the eighth and ninth decades; early-onset forms seen in the fifth and sixth decades are often related to known causative mutations. Symp- toms and pathology do not differ markedly at different onset ages. However, younger in- dividuals are more likely to survive the full course of the disease, while older individuals are more likely to have numerous medical comorbidities that affect the course and man- agement of the illness. Diagnostic complexity is higher in older adults because of the in- creased likelihood of comorbid medical illness and mixed pathology. Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Traumatic brain injury increases risk for major or mild NCD due to Alz- heimer’s disease. Genetic and physiological. Age is the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. The genetic susceptibility polymorphism apolipoprotein E4 increases risk and decreases age at onset, particularly in homozygous individuals. There are also extremely rare causative Alzheimer’s disease genes. Individuals with Down’s syndrome (trisomy 21) develop Alz- heimer’s disease if they survive to midlife. Multiple vascular risk factors influence risk for Alzheimer’s disease and may act by increasing cerebrovascular pathology or also through direct effects on Alzheimer pathology. Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Detection of an NCD may be more difficult in cultural and socioeconomic settings where memory loss is considered normal in old age, where older adults face fewer cognitive de- mands in everyday life, or where very low educational levels pose greater challenges to objective cognitive assessment. Diagnostic Markers Cortical atrophy, amyloid-predominant neuritic plaques, and tau-predominant neurofibril- lary tangles are hallmarks of the pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and may be confirmed via postmortem histopathological examination. For early-onset cases with auto- somal dominant inheritance, a mutation in one of the known causative Alzheimer’s disease genes—amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), or presenilin 2 (PSEN2)— may be involved, and genetic testing for such mutations is commercially available, at least for PSEN1. Apolipoprotein E4 cannot serve as a diagnostic marker because it is only a risk factor and neither necessary nor sufficient for disease occurrence. Since amyloid beta-42 deposition in the brain occurs early in the pathophysiological cascade, amyloid-based diagnostic tests such as amyloid imaging on brain positron emis- sion tomography (PET) scans and reduced levels of amyloid beta-42 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may have diagnostic value. Signs of neuronal injury, such as hippocampal and temporoparietal cortical atrophy on a magnetic resonance image scan, temporoparietal hypometabolism on a fluorodeoxyglucose PET scan, and evidence for elevated total tau and phospho-tau levels in CSF, provide evidence of neuronal damage but are less specific for Alzheimer’s disease. At present, these biomarkers are not fully validated, and many are available only in tertiary care settings. However, some of them, along with novel bio- markers, will likely move into wider clinical practice in the coming years. 614 Neurocognitive Disorders Functional Consequences of Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer’s Disease The prominence of memory loss can cause significant difficulties relatively early in the course. Social cognition (and thus social functioning) and procedural memory (e.g., danc- ing, playing musical instruments) may be relatively preserved for extended periods. Differential Diagnosis Other neurocognitive disorders. Major and mild NCDs due to other neurodegenera- tive processes (e.g., Lewy body disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration) share the in- sidious onset and gradual decline caused by Alzheimer’s disease but have distinctive core features of their own. In major or mild vascular NCD, there is typically history of stroke temporally related to the onset of cognitive impairment, and infarcts or white matter hy- perintensities are judged sufficient to account for the clinical picture. However, particu- larly when there is no clear history of stepwise decline, major or mild vascular NCD can share many clinical features with Alzheimer’s disease. Other concurrent, active neurological or systemic illness. Other neurological or sys- temic illness should be considered if there is an appropriate temporal relationship and severity to account for the clinical picture. At the mild NCD level, it may be difficult to dis- tinguish an Alzheimer’s disease etiology from that of another medical condition (e.g., thy- roid disorders, vitamin B12 deficiency). Major depressive disorder. Particularly at the mild NCD level, the differential diagnosis also includes major depression. The presence of depression may be associated with re- duced daily functioning and poor concentration that may resemble an NCD, but improve- ment with treatment of depression may be useful in making the distinction. Comorbidity Most individuals with Alzheimer’s disease are elderly and have multiple medical conditions that can complicate diagnosis and influence the clinical course. Major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease commonly co-occurs with cerebrovascular disease, which contributes to the clinical picture. When a comorbid condition contributes to the NCD in an individual with Alzheimer’s disease, then NCD due to multiple etiologies should be diagnosed."}

The behavioral variant and three language variants (se-\nmantic, agrammatic\/nonfluent, and logopenic) exhibit distinct patterns of brain atrophy and\nsome distinctive neuropathology. The criteria must be met for either the behavioral or the lan-\nguage variant to make the diagnosis, but many individuals present with features of both.\nIndividuals with behavioral-variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD present with\nvarying degrees of apathy or disinhibition. They may lose interest in socialization, self-\ncare, and personal responsibilities, or display socially inappropriate behaviors. Insight is\nusually impaired, and this often delays medical consultation. The first referral is often to a\npsychiatrist. Individuals may develop changes in social style, and in religious and political\nbeliefs, with repetitive movements, hoarding, changes in eating behavior, and hyperoral-\nity. In later stages, loss of sphincter control may occur. Cognitive decline is less prominent,\nand formal testing may show relatively few deficits in the early stages. Common neuro-\ncognitive symptoms are lack of planning and organization, distractibility, and poor judg-\nment. Deficits in executive function, such as poor performance on tests of mental\n616\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nflexibility, abstract reasoning, and response inhibition, are present, but learning and mem-\nory are relatively spared, and perceptual-motor abilities are almost always preserved in\nthe early stages. \nIndividuals with language-variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD present with pri-\nmary progressive aphasia with gradual onset, with three subtypes commonly described:\nsemantic variant, agrammatic\/nonfluent variant, and logopenic variant, and each variant\nhas distinctive features and corresponding neuropathology.\n“Probable” is distinguished from “possible” frontotemporal NCD by the presence of\ncausative genetic factors (e.g., mutations in the gene coding for microtubule-associated pro-\ntein tau) or by the presence of distinctive atrophy or reduced activity in frontotemporal re-\ngions on structural or functional imaging. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nExtrapyramidal features may be prominent in some cases, with an overlap with syn-\ndromes such as progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. Features of\nmotor neuron disease may be present in some cases (e.g., muscle atrophy, weakness). A\nsubset of individuals develop visual hallucinations.\nPrevalence\nMajor or mild frontotemporal NCD is a common cause of early-onset NCD in individuals\nyounger than 65 years. Population prevalence estimates are in the range of 2–10 per\n100,000. Approximately 20%–25% of cases of frontotemporal NCD occur in individuals\nolder than 65 years. Frontotemporal NCD accounts for about 5% of all cases of dementia in\nunselected autopsy series. Prevalence estimates of behavioral variant and semantic lan-\nguage variant are higher among males, and prevalence estimates of nonfluent language\nvariant are higher among females. \nDevelopment and Course\nIndividuals with major or mild frontotemporal NCD commonly present in the sixth de-\ncade of life, although the age at onset varies from the third to the ninth decades. The dis-\nease is gradually progressive, with median survival being 6–11 years after symptom onset\nand 3–4 years after diagnosis. Survival is shorter and decline is faster in major or mild fron-\ntotemporal NCD than in typical Alzheimer’s disease. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nGenetic and physiological.\nApproximately 40% of individuals with major or mild fron-\ntotemporal NCD have a family history of early-onset NCD, and approximately 10% show an\nautosomal dominant inheritance pattern. A number of genetic factors have been identified,\nsuch as mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT), the\ngranulin gene (GRN), and the C9ORF72 gene. A number of families with causative muta-\ntions have been identified (see the section “Diagnostic Markers” for this disorder), but many\nindividuals with known familial transmission do not have a known mutation. The presence\nof motor neuron disease is associated with a more rapid deterioration. \nDiagnostic Markers\nComputed tomography (CT) or structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may show\ndistinct patterns of atrophy. In behavioral-variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD,\nboth frontal lobes (especially the medial frontal lobes) and the anterior temporal lobes are\natrophic. In semantic language–variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD, the middle,\ninferior, and anterior temporal lobes are atrophic bilaterally but asymmetrically, with the\nMajor or Mild Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder\n617\nleft side usually being more affected. Nonfluent language–variant major or mild fronto-\ntemporal NCD is associated with predominantly left posterior frontal-insular atrophy.\nThe logopenic variant of major or mild frontotemporal NCD is associated with predomi-\nnantly left posterior perisylvian or parietal atrophy. Functional imaging demonstrates hy-\npoperfusion and\/or cortical hypometabolism in the corresponding brain regions, which\nmay be present in the early stages in the absence of structural abnormality. Emerging bio-\nmarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta and tau levels, and\namyloid imaging) may help in the differential diagnosis, but the distinction from Alzhei-\nmer’s disease can remain difficult (the logopenic variant is in fact often a manifestation of\nAlzheimer’s disease).\nIn familial cases of frontotemporal NCD, the identification of genetic mutations may\nhelp confirm the diagnosis. Mutations associated with frontotemporal NCD include\nthe genes encoding microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) and granulin (GRN),\nC9ORF72, transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43, or TARDBP),\nvalosin-containing protein (VCP), chromatin modifying protein 2B (CHMP2B), and fused\nin sarcoma protein (FUS). \nFunctional Consequences of Major or Mild \nFrontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder\nBecause of the relative early age at onset of the disorder, the disorder oftens affects work-\nplace and family life. Because of the involvement of language and\/or behavior, function is\noften more severely impaired relatively early in the course. For individuals with the be-\nhavioral variant, prior to diagnostic clarification there may be significant family disrup-\ntion, legal involvement, and problems in the workplace because of socially inappropriate\nbehaviors. The functional impairment due to behavioral change and language dysfunc-\ntion, which can include hyperorality, impulsive wandering, and other dishinhibited be-\nhaviors, may far exceed that due to the cognitive disturbance and may lead to nursing\nhome placement or institutionalization. These behaviors can be severely disruptive, even\nin structured care settings, particularly when the individuals are otherwise healthy, non-\nfrail, and free of other medical comorbidities. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther neurocognitive disorders.\nOther neurodegenerative diseases may be distinguished\nfrom major or mild frontotemporal NCD by their characteristic features. In major or mild\nNCD due to Alzheimer’s disease, decline in learning and memory is an early feature.\nHowever, 10%–30% of patients presenting with a syndrome suggestive of major or mild\nfrontotemporal NCD are found at autopsy to have Alzheimer’s disease pathology. This oc-\ncurs more frequently in individuals who present with progressive dysexecutive syn-\ndromes in the absence of behavioral changes or movement disorder or in those with the\nlogopenic variant.\nIn major or mild NCD with Lewy bodies, core and suggestive features of Lewy bodies\nmust be present. In major or mild NCD due to Parkinson’s disease, spontaneous parkin-\nsonism emerges well before the cognitive decline. In major or mild vascular NCD, depend-\ning on affected brain regions, there may also be loss of executive ability and behavioral\nchanges such as apathy, and this disorder should be considered in the differential diagno-\nsis. However, history of a cerebrovascular event is temporally related to the onset of cog-\nnitive impairment in major or mild vascular NCD, and neuroimaging reveals infarctions\nor white matter lesions sufficient to account for the clinical picture. \nOther neurological conditions.\nMajor or mild frontotemporal NCD overlaps with pro-\ngressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and motor neuron disease\nclinically as well as pathologically. Progressive supranuclear palsy is characterized by\n618\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nsupranuclear gaze palsies and axial-predominant parkinsonism. Pseudobulbar signs may\nbe present, and retropulsion is often prominent. Neurocognitive assessment shows psy-\nchomotor slowing, poor working memory, and executive dysfunction. Corticobasal degen-\neration presents with asymmetric rigidity, limb apraxia, postural instability, myoclonus,\nalien limb phenomenon, and cortical sensory loss. Many individuals with behavioral-variant\nmajor or mild frontotemporal NCD show features of motor neuron disease, which tend to\nbe mixed upper and predominantly lower motor neuron disease. \nOther mental disorders and medical conditions.\nBehavioral-variant major or mild fron-\ntotemporal NCD may be mistaken for a primary mental disorder, such as major depression,\nbipolar disorders, or schizophrenia, and individuals with this variant often present initially\nto psychiatry. Over time, the development of progressive neurocognitive difficulties will\nhelp to make the distinction. A careful medical evaluation will help to exclude treatable\ncauses of NCDs, such as metabolic disturbances, nutritional deficiencies, and infections."}

(Note: Do not\nuse the additional code for Lewy body disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded\nbut should still be indicated in writing.)\nDiagnostic Features\nMajor or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies (NCDLB), in the case of major\nneurocognitive disorder (NCD), corresponds to the condition known as dementia with\nLewy bodies (DLB). The disorder includes not only progressive cognitive impairment\n(with early changes in complex attention and executive function rather than learning and\nmemory) but also recurrent complex visual hallucinations; and concurrent symptoms of\nrapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (which can be a very early manifes-\ntation); as well as hallucinations in other sensory modalities, depression, and delusions.\nThe symptoms fluctuate in a pattern that can resemble a delirium, but no adequate under-\nlying cause can be found. The variable presentation of NCDLB symptoms reduces the like-\nlihood of all symptoms being observed in a brief clinic visit and necessitates a thorough\nassessment of caregiver observations. The use of assessment scales specifically designed to\nassess fluctuation may aid in diagnosis. Another core feature is spontaneous parkinson-\nism, which must begin after the onset of cognitive decline; by convention, major cognitive\ndeficits are observed at least 1 year before the motor symptoms. The parkinsonism must\nalso be distinguished from neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal signs. Accurate diagnosis\nis essential to safe treatment planning, as up to 50% of individuals with NCDLB have se-\nvere sensitivity to neuroleptic drugs, and these medications should be used with extreme\ncaution in managing the psychotic manifestations.\nThe diagnosis of mild NCDLB is appropriate for individuals who present with the core\nor suggestive features at a stage when cognitive or functional impairments are not of suf-\nficient severity to fulfill criteria for major NCD. However, as for all mild NCDs, there will\noften be insufficient evidence to justify any single etiology, and use of the unspecified di-\nagnosis is most appropriate.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIndividuals with NCDLB frequently experience repeated falls and syncope and transient\nepisodes of unexplained loss of consciousness. Autonomic dysfunction, such as ortho-\nstatic hypotension and urinary incontinence, may be observed. Auditory and other\nnonvisual hallucinations are common, as are systematized delusions, delusional misiden-\ntification, and depression.\nPrevalence\nThe few population-based prevalence estimates for NCDLB available range from 0.1% to\n5% of the general elderly population, and from 1.7% to 30.5% of all dementia cases. In\nbrain bank (autopsy) series, the pathological lesions known as Lewy bodies are present in\n20%–35% of cases of dementia. The male-to-female ratio is approximately 1.5:1. \nDevelopment and Course \nNCDLB is a gradually progressive disorder with insidious onset. However, there is often\na prodromal history of confusional episodes (delirium) of acute onset, often precipitated\nby illness or surgery. The distinction between NCDLB, in which Lewy bodies are primar-\nily cortical in location, and major or mild NCD due to Parkinson’s disease, in which the pa-\nthology is primarily in the basal ganglia, is the order in which the cognitive and motor\nsymptoms emerge. In NCDLB, the cognitive decline is manifested early in the course of ill-\nness, at least a year before the onset of motor symptoms (see the section “Differential Di-\n620\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nagnosis” for this disorder). Disease course may be characterized by occasional plateaus\nbut eventually progresses through severe dementia to death. Average duration of survival\nis 5–7 years in clinical series. Onset of symptoms is typically observed from the sixth\nthrough the ninth decades of life, with most cases having their onset when affected indi-\nviduals are in their mid-70s.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nGenetic and physiological.\nFamilial aggregation may occur, and several risk genes have\nbeen identified, but in most cases of NCDLB, there is no family history.\nDiagnostic Markers\nThe underlying neurodegenerative disease is primarily a synucleinopathy due to alpha-\nsynuclein misfolding and aggregation. Cognitive testing beyond the use of a brief screen-\ning instrument may be necessary to define deficits clearly. Assessment scales developed to\nmeasure fluctuation can be useful. The associated condition REM sleep behavior disorder\nmay be diagnosed through a formal sleep study or identified by questioning the patient or\ninformant about relevant symptoms. Neuroleptic sensitivity (challenge) is not recom-\nmended as a diagnostic marker but raises suspicion of NCDLB if it occurs. A diagnosti-\ncally suggestive feature is low striatal dopamine transporter uptake on single photon\nemission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) scan.\nOther clinically useful markers potentially include relative preservation of medial tempo-\nral structures on computed tomography (CT)\/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain\nscan; reduced striatal dopamine transporter uptake on SPECT\/PET scan; generalized low\nuptake on SPECT\/PET perfusion scan with reduced occipital activity; abnormal (low up-\ntake) MIBG myocardial scintigraphy suggesting sympathetic denervation; and prominent\nslow-wave activity on the electroencephalogram with temporal lobe transient waves.\nFunctional Consequences of Major or Mild \nNeurocognitive Disorder With Lewy Bodies\nIndividuals with NCDLB are more functionally impaired than would be expected for their\ncognitive deficits when contrasted to individuals with other neurodegenerative diseases,\nsuch as Alzheimer’s disease. This is largely a result of motor and autonomic impairments,\nwhich cause problems with toileting, transferring, and eating. Sleep disorders and prom-\ninent psychiatric symptoms may also add to functional difficulties. Consequently, the qual-\nity of life of individuals with NCDLB is often significantly worse than that of individuals\nwith Alzheimer’s disease.\nDifferential Diagnosis \nMajor or mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson’s disease.\nA key differenti-\nating feature in clinical diagnosis is the temporal sequence in which the parkinsonism and\nthe NCD appear. For NCD due to Parkinson’s disease, the individual must develop cog-\nnitive decline in the context of established Parkinson’s disease; by convention, the decline\nshould not reach the stage of major NCD until at least 1 year after Parkinson’s is diagnosed.\nIf less than a year has passed since the onset of motor symptoms, the diagnosis is NCDLB.\nThis distinction is clearer at the major NCD level than at the mild NCD level. \nThe timing and sequence of parkinsonism and mild NCD may be more difficult to de-\ntermine because the onset and clinical presentation can be ambiguous, and unspecified\nmild NCD should be diagnosed if the other core and suggestive features are absent.\nMajor or Mild Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder\n621\nComorbidity \nLewy body pathology frequently coexists with Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular\ndisease pathology, particularly among the oldest age groups. In Alzheimer’s disease, there\nis concomitant synuclein pathology in 60% of cases (if amygdala-restricted cases are in-\ncluded). In general, there is a higher rate of Lewy body pathology in individuals with de-\nmentia than in older individuals without dementia."}

For probable major vascular neurocognitive disorder,\nwithout behavioral disturbance, code 290.40 (F01.50).

(Note: Do not use an\nadditional code for the vascular disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but\nshould still be indicated in writing.)\nDiagnostic Features\nThe diagnosis of major or mild vascular neurocognitive disorder (NCD) requires the es-\ntablishment of an NCD (Criterion A) and the determination that cerebrovascular disease is\nthe dominant if not exclusive pathology that accounts for the cognitive deficits (Criteria B\nand C). Vascular etiology may range from large vessel stroke to microvascular disease; the\n622\nNeurocognitive Disorders\npresentation is therefore very heterogeneous, stemming from the types of vascular lesions\nand their extent and location. The lesions may be focal, multifocal, or diffuse and occur in\nvarious combinations. \nMany individuals with major or mild vascular NCD present with multiple infarctions,\nwith an acute stepwise or fluctuating decline in cognition, and intervening periods of\nstability and even some improvement. Others may have gradual onset with slow pro-\ngression, a rapid development of deficits followed by relative stability, or another complex\npresentation. Major or mild vascular NCD with a gradual onset and slow progression is\ngenerally due to small vessel disease leading to lesions in the white matter, basal ganglia,\nand\/or thalamus. The gradual progression in these cases is often punctuated by acute\nevents that leave subtle neurological deficits. The cognitive deficits in these cases can be at-\ntributed to disruption of cortical-subcortical circuits, and complex attention, particularly\nspeed of information processing, and executive ability are likely to be affected.\nAssessing for the presence of sufficient cerebrovascular disease relies on history, phys-\nical examination, and neuroimaging (Criterion C). Etiological certainty requires the dem-\nonstration of abnormalities on neuroimaging. The lack of neuroimaging can result in\nsignificant diagnostic inaccuracy by overlooking “silent” brain infarction and white mat-\nter lesions. However, if the neurocognitive impairment is temporally associated with one\nor more well-documented strokes, a probable diagnosis can be made in the absence of neu-\nroimaging. Clinical evidence of cerebrovascular disease includes documented history of\nstroke, with cognitive decline temporally associated with the event, or physical signs con-\nsistent with stroke (e.g., hemiparesis; pseudobulbar syndrome, visual field defect). Neuro-\nimaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or computed tomography [CT]) evidence of\ncerebrovascular disease comprises one or more of the following: one or more large vessel\ninfarcts or hemorrhages, a strategically placed single infarct or hemorrhage (e.g., in angu-\nlar gyrus, thalamus, basal forebrain), two or more lacunar infarcts outside the brain stem,\nor extensive and confluent white matter lesions. The latter is often termed small vessel dis-\nease or subcortical ischemic changes on clinical neuroimaging evaluations.\nFor mild vascular NCD, history of a single stroke or extensive white matter disease is gen-\nerally sufficient. For major vascular NCD, two or more strokes, a strategically placed stroke,\nor a combination of white matter disease and one or more lacunes is generally necessary.\nThe disorder must not be better explained by another disorder. For example, promi-\nnent memory deficit early in the course might suggest Alzheimer's disease, early and\nprominent parkinsonian features would suggest Parkinson's disease, and a close associa-\ntion between onset and depression would suggest depression.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nA neurological assessment often reveals history of stroke and\/or transient ischemic epi-\nsodes, and signs indicative of brain infarctions. Also commonly associated are personality\nand mood changes, abulia, depression, and emotional lability. The development of late-\nonset depressive symptoms accompanied by psychomotor slowing and executive dys-\nfunction is a common presentation among older adults with progressive small vessel isch-\nemic disease (“vascular depression”).\nPrevalence\nMajor or mild vascular NCD is the second most common cause of NCD after Alzheimer’s\ndisease. In the United States, population prevalence estimates for vascular dementia range\nfrom 0.2% in the 65–70 years age group to 16% in individuals 80 years and older. Within\n3 months following stroke, 20%–30% of individuals are diagnosed with dementia. In neu-\nropathology series, the prevalence of vascular dementia increases from 13% at age 70 years\nto 44.6% at age 90 years or older, in comparison with Alzheimer’s disease (23.6%–51%) and\ncombined vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (2%–46.4%). Higher prevalence has\nMajor or Mild Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder\n623\nbeen reported in African Americans compared with Caucasians, and in East Asian countries\n(e.g., Japan, China). Prevalence is higher in males than in females.\nDevelopment and Course\nMajor or mild vascular NCD can occur at any age, although the prevalence increases ex-\nponentially after age 65 years. In older individuals, additional pathologies may partly ac-\ncount for the neurocognitive deficits. The course may vary from acute onset with partial\nimprovement to stepwise decline to progressive decline, with fluctuations and plateaus of\nvarying durations. Pure subcortical major or mild vascular NCD can have a slowly pro-\ngressive course that simulates major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nEnvironmental.\nThe neurocognitive outcomes of vascular brain injury are influenced by\nneuroplasticity factors such as education, physical exercise, and mental activity.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThe major risk factors for major or mild vascular NCD are the\nsame as those for cerebrovascular disease, including hypertension, diabetes, smoking, obesity,\nhigh cholesterol levels, high homocysteine levels, other risk factors for atherosclerosis and ar-\nteriolosclerosis, atrial fibrillation, and other conditions increasing the risk of cerebral emboli.\nCerebral amyloid angiopathy is an important risk factor in which amyloid deposits occur\nwithin arterial vessels. Another key risk factor is the hereditary condition cerebral autosomal\ndominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, or CADASIL.\nDiagnostic Markers\nStructural neuroimaging, using MRI or CT, has an important role in the diagnostic pro-\ncess. There are no other established biomarkers of major or mild vascular NCD. \nFunctional Consequences of \nMajor or Mild Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder\nMajor or mild vascular NCD is commonly associated with physical deficits that cause ad-\nditional disability. \nDifferential Diagnosis \nOther neurocognitive disorders.\nSince incidental brain infarctions and white matter le-\nsions are common in older individuals, it is important to consider other possible etiologies\nwhen an NCD is present. A history of memory deficit early in the course, and progressive\nworsening of memory, language, executive function, and perceptual-motor abilities in the\nabsence of corresponding focal lesions on brain imaging, are suggestive of Alzheimer’s\ndisease as the primary diagnosis. Potential biomarkers currently being validated for Alz-\nheimer’s disease, such as cerebrospinal fluid levels of beta-amyloid and phosphorylated\ntau, and amyloid imaging, may prove to be helpful in the differential diagnosis. NCD with\nLewy bodies is distinguished from major or mild vascular NCD by its core features of fluc-\ntuating cognition, visual hallucinations, and spontaneous parkinsonism. While deficits in\nexecutive function and language occur in major or mild vascular NCD, the insidious onset\nand gradual progression of behavioral features or language impairment are characteristic\nof frontotemporal NCD and are not typical of vascular etiology.\nOther medical conditions.\nA diagnosis of major or mild vascular NCD is not made if\nother diseases (e.g., brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, encephalitis, toxic or metabolic disor-\nders) are present and are of sufficient severity to account for the cognitive impairment.\n624\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nOther mental disorders.\nA diagnosis of major or mild vascular NCD is inappropriate if\nthe symptoms can be entirely attributed to delirium, although delirium may sometimes be\nsuperimposed on a preexisting major or mild vascular NCD, in which case both diagnoses\ncan be made. If the criteria for major depressive disorder are met and the cognitive impair-\nment is temporally related to the likely onset of the depression, major or mild vascular\nNCD should not be diagnosed. However, if the NCD preceded the development of the de-\npression, or the severity of the cognitive impairment is out of proportion to the severity of\nthe depression, both should be diagnosed. \nComorbidity\nMajor or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease commonly co-occurs with major or mild\nvascular NCD, in which case both diagnoses should be made. Major or mild vascular NCD\nand depression frequently co-occur."}

Traumatic brain injury is defined as brain trauma with spe-\ncific characteristics that include at least one of the following: loss of consciousness, post-\ntraumatic amnesia, disorientation and confusion, or, in more severe cases, neurological\nsigns (e.g., positive neuroimaging, a new onset of seizures or a marked worsening of a pre-\nexisting seizure disorder, visual field cuts, anosmia, hemiparesis) (Criterion B). To be at-\ntributable to TBI, the NCD must present either immediately after the brain injury occurs or\nimmediately after the individual recovers consciousness after the injury and persist past\nthe acute post-injury period (Criterion C). \nThe cognitive presentation is variable. Difficulties in the domains of complex attention,\nexecutive ability, learning, and memory are common as well as slowing in speed of infor-\nmation processing and disturbances in social cognition. In more severe TBI in which there\nis brain contusion, intracranial hemorrhage, or penetrating injury, there may be additional\nneurocognitive deficits, such as aphasia, neglect, and constructional dyspraxia.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nMajor or mild NCD due to TBI may be accompanied by disturbances in emotional function\n(e.g., irritability, easy frustration, tension and anxiety, affective lability); personality\nchanges (e.g., disinhibition, apathy, suspiciousness, aggression); physical disturbances\n(e.g., headache, fatigue, sleep disorders, vertigo or dizziness, tinnitus or hyperacusis, pho-\ntosensitivity, anosmia, reduced tolerance to psychotropic medications); and, particularly\nin more severe TBI, neurological symptoms and signs (e.g., seizures, hemiparesis, visual\ndisturbances, cranial nerve deficits) and evidence of orthopedic injuries.\nPrevalence\nIn the United States, 1.7 million TBIs occur annually, resulting in 1.4 million emergency de-\npartment visits, 275,000 hospitalizations, and 52,000 deaths. About 2% of the population\nlives with TBI-associated disability. Males account for 59% of TBIs in the United States.\nThe most common etiologies of TBI in the United States are falls, vehicular accidents, and\nbeing struck on the head. Collisions and blows to the head that occur in the course of con-\ntact sports are increasingly recognized as sources of mild TBI, with a concern that repeated\nmild TBI may have cumulatively persisting sequelae.\nDevelopment and Course\nThe severity of a TBI is rated at the time of injury\/initial assessment as mild, moderate, or\nsevere according to the thresholds in Table 2.\nThe severity rating of the TBI itself does not necessarily correspond to the severity of\nthe resulting NCD. The course of recovery from TBI is variable, depending not only on the\nspecifics of the injury but also on cofactors, such as age, prior history of brain damage, or\nsubstance abuse, that may favor or impede recovery. \n626\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nNeurobehavioral symptoms tend to be most severe in the immediate aftermath of the\nTBI. Except in the case of severe TBI, the typical course is that of complete or substantial\nimprovement in associated neurocognitive, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms and\nsigns. Neurocognitive symptoms associated with mild TBI tend to resolve within days to\nweeks after the injury with complete resolution typical by 3 months. Other symptoms that\nmay potentially co-occur with the neurological symptoms (e.g., depression, irritability,\nfatigue, headache, photosensitivity, sleep disturbance) also tend to resolve in the weeks\nfollowing mild TBI. Substantial subsequent deterioration in these areas should trigger con-\nsideration of additional diagnoses. However, repeated mild TBI may be associated with\npersisting neurocognitive disturbance. \nWith moderate and severe TBI, in addition to persistence of neurocognitive deficits,\nthere may be associated neurophysiological, emotional, and behavioral complications.\nThese include seizures (particularly in the first year), photosensitivity, hyperacusis, irritabil-\nity, aggression, depression, sleep disturbance, fatigue, apathy, inability to resume occu-\npational and social functioning at pre-injury level, and deterioration in interpersonal\nrelationships. Moderate and severe TBI have been associated with increased risk of depres-\nsion, aggression, and possibly neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.\nThe features of persisting major or mild NCD due to TBI will vary by age, specifics of\nthe injury, and cofactors. Persisting TBI-related impairment in an infant or child may be re-\nflected in delays in reaching developmental milestones (e.g., language acquisition), worse\nacademic performance, and possibly impaired social development. Among older teenag-\ners and adults, persisting symptoms may include various neurocognitive deficits, irrita-\nbility, hypersensitivity to light and sound, easy fatigability, and mood changes, including\ndepression, anxiety, hostility, or apathy. In older individuals with depleted cognitive re-\nserve, mild TBI is more likely to result in incomplete recoveries.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nRisk factors for traumatic brain injury.\nTraumatic brain injury rates vary by age, with\nthe highest prevalence among individuals younger than 4 years, older adolescents, and in-\ndividuals older than 65 years. Falls are the most common cause of TBI, with motor vehicle\naccidents being second. Sports concussions are frequent causes of TBI in older children,\nteenagers, and young adults.\nRisk factors for neurocognitive disorder after traumatic brain injury.\nRepeated con-\ncussions can lead to persistent NCD and neuropathological evidence of traumatic enceph-\nalopathy.

With major NCD due to TBI, an\nindividual may have difficulty in independent living and self-care. Prominent neuromotor\nfeatures, such as severe incoordination, ataxia, and motor slowing, may be present in major\nNCD due to TBI and may add to functional difficulties. Individuals with TBI histories report\nmore depressive symptoms, and these can amplify cognitive complaints and worsen func-\ntional outcome. Additionally, loss of emotional control, including aggressive or inappropriate\naffect and apathy, may be present after more severe TBI with greater neurocognitive impair-\nment. These features may compound difficulties with independent living and self-care.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nIn some instances, severity of neurocognitive symptoms may appear to be inconsistent\nwith the severity of the TBI. After previously undetected neurological complications (e.g.,\nchronic hematoma) are excluded, the possibility of diagnoses such as somatic symptom\ndisorder or factitious disorder need to be considered. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\ncan co-occur with the NCD and have overlapping symptoms (e.g., difficulty concentrat-\ning, depressed mood, aggressive behavioral disinhibition).\nComorbidity\nAmong individuals with substance use disorders, the neurocognitive effects of the sub-\nstance contribute to or compound the TBI-associated neurocognitive change. Some symp-\ntoms associated with TBI may overlap with symptoms found in cases of PTSD, and the two\ndisorders may co-occur, especially in military populations."}

If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the sub-\nstance-induced neurocognitive disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician\nshould record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced neurocognitive\ndisorder (e.g., “mild inhalant use disorder with inhalant-induced major neurocognitive disor-\nder”).

If there is no comorbid substance\nuse disorder, then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the\nsubstance-induced neurocognitive disorder.

The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in\nthe criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of\nthe classes, the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance\nis judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the cat-\negory “unknown substance” should be used.\nThe name of the disorder (i.e., [specific substance]-induced major neurocognitive dis-\norder or [specific substance]-induced mild neurocognitive disorder) is followed by the\ntype in the case of alcohol (i.e., nonamnestic-confabulatory type, amnestic-confabulatory\ntype), followed by specification of duration (i.e., persistent). Unlike the recording procedures\nfor ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance\/medication-induced disorder and sub-\nstance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for\nthe substance use disorder. For example, in the case of persistent amnestic-confabulatory\nsymptoms in a man with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is 291.1 alcohol-\ninduced major neurocognitive disorder, amnestic-confabulatory type, persistent. An addi-\ntional diagnosis of 303.90 severe alcohol use disorder is also given. If the substance\/medi-\ncation-induced neurocognitive disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder\n(e.g., after a sporadic heavy use of inhalants), no accompanying substance use disorder is\nnoted (e.g., 292.82 inhalant-induced mild neurocognitive disorder). \nICD-10-CM.\nThe name of the substance\/medication-induced neurocognitive disorder\nbegins with the specific substance (e.g., alcohol) that is presumed to be causing the neuro-\ncognitive symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria\nset, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use\ndisorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes, the code for “other sub-\nstance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological fac-\ntor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance”\nshould be used.\nWhen recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is\nlisted first, followed by the word “with,” followed by the name of the disorder (i.e., [specific\nsubstance]-induced major neurocognitive disorder or [specific substance]-induced mild\nneurocognitive disorder), followed by the type in the case of alcohol (i.e., nonamnestic-con-\nfabulatory type, amnestic-confabulatory type), followed by specification of duration (i.e.,\npersistent). For example, in the case of persistent amnestic-confabulatory symptoms in a\nman with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is F10.26 severe alcohol use disorder\nwith alcohol-induced major neurocognitive disorder, amnestic-confabulatory type, persis-\ntent. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe alcohol use disorder is not given. If the\nsubstance-induced neurocognitive disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use dis-\norder (e.g., after a sporadic heavy use of inhalants), no accompanying substance use disor-\nder is noted (e.g., F18.988 inhalant-induced mild neurocognitive disorder).\nDiagnostic Features \nSubstance\/medication-induced major or mild NCD is characterized by neurocognitive\nimpairments that persist beyond the usual duration of intoxication and acute withdrawal\n(Criterion B). Initially, these manifestations can reflect slow recovery of brain functions\nfrom a period of prolonged substance use, and improvements in neurocognitive as well as\n630\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nbrain imaging indicators may be seen over many months. If the disorder continues for an\nextended period, persistent should be specified. The given substance and its use must be\nknown to be capable of causing the observed impairments (Criterion C). While nonspecific\ndecrements in a range of cognitive abilities can occur with nearly any substance of abuse\nand a variety of medications, some patterns occur more frequently with selected drug\nclasses. For example, NCD due to sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drugs (e.g., benzodiaz-\nepines, barbiturates) may show greater disturbances in memory than in other cognitive\nfunctions. NCD induced by alcohol frequently manifests with a combination of impair-\nments in executive-function and memory and learning domains. The temporal course of\nthe substance-induced NCD must be consistent with that of use of the given substance\n(Criterion D). In alcohol-induced amnestic confabulatory (Korsakoff’s) NCD, the features\ninclude prominent amnesia (severe difficulty learning new information with rapid forget-\nting) and a tendency to confabulate. These manifestations may co-occur with signs of thi-\namine encephalopathy (Wernicke’s encephalopathy) with associated features such as\nnystagmus and ataxia. Ophthalmoplegia of Wernicke’s encephalopathy is typically charac-\nterized by a lateral gaze paralysis.\nIn addition to or independent of the more common neurocognitive symptoms related\nto methamphetamine use (e.g., difficulties with learning and memory; executive func-\ntion), methamphetamine use can also be associated with evidence of vascular injury (e.g.,\nfocal weakness, unilateral incoordination, asymmetrical reflexes). The most common neu-\nrocognitive profile approximates that seen in vascular NCD. \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nIntermediate-duration NCD induced by drugs with central nervous system depressant effects\nmay manifest with added symptoms of increased irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and\ndysphoria. Intermediate-duration NCD induced by stimulant drugs may manifest with re-\nbound depression, hypersomnia, and apathy. In severe forms of substance\/medication-\ninduced major NCD (e.g., associated with long-term alcohol use), there may be prominent\nneuromotor features, such as incoordination, ataxia, and motor slowing. There may also be\nloss of emotional control, including aggressive or inappropriate affect, or apathy.\nPrevalence\nThe prevalence of these conditions is not known. Prevalence figures for substance abuse are\navailable, and substance\/medication-induced major or mild NCDs are more likely in those\nwho are older, have longer use, and have other risk factors such as nutritional deficits.\nFor alcohol abuse, the rate of mild NCD of intermediate duration is approximately 30%–\n40% in the first 2 months of abstinence. Mild NCD may persist, particularly in those who do\nnot achieve stable abstinence until after age 50 years. Major NCD is rare and may result from\nconcomitant nutritional deficits, as in alcohol-induced amnestic confabulatory NCD.\nFor individuals quitting cocaine, methamphetamine, opioids, phencyclidine, and sed-\native, hypnotics, or anxiolytics, substance\/medication-induced mild NCD of intermediate\nduration may occur in one-third or more, and there is some evidence that these substances\nmay also be associated with persistent mild NCD. Major NCD associated with these sub-\nstances is rare, if it occurs at all. In the case of methamphetamine, cerebrovascular disease\ncan also occur, resulting in diffuse or focal brain injury that can be of mild or major neu-\nrocognitive levels. Solvent exposure has been linked to both major and mild NCD of both\nintermediate and persistent duration. \nThe presence of NCD induced by cannabis and various hallucinogens is controversial.\nWith cannabis, intoxication is accompanied by various neurocognitive disturbances, but\nthese tend to clear with abstinence. \nSubstance\/Medication-Induced Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder\n631\nDevelopment and Course\nSubstance use disorders tend to commence during adolescence and peak in the 20s and\n30s. Although longer history of severe substance use disorder is associated with greater\nlikelihood of NCD, the relationships are not straightforward, with substantial and even\ncomplete recovery of neurocognitive functions being common among individuals who\nachieve stable abstinence prior to age 50 years. Substance\/medication-induced major or\nmild NCD is most likely to become persistent in individuals who continue abuse of sub-\nstances past age 50 years, presumably because of a combination of lessened neural plas-\nticity and beginnings of other age-related brain changes. Earlier commencement of abuse,\nparticularly of alcohol, may lead to defects in later neural development (e.g., later stages of\nmaturation of frontal circuitries), which may have effects on social cognition as well as\nother neurocognitive abilities. For alcohol-induced NCD, there may be an additive effect\nof aging and alcohol-induced brain injury.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nRisk factors for substance\/medication-induced NCDs include older age, longer use, and\npersistent use past age 50 years. In addition, for alcohol-induced NCD, long-term nutri-\ntional deficiencies, liver disease, vascular risk factors, and cardiovascular and cerebrovas-\ncular disease may contribute to risk. \nDiagnostic Markers\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of individuals with chronic alcohol abuse frequently\nreveals cortical thinning, white matter loss, and enlargement of sulci and ventricles. While\nneuroimaging abnormalities are more common in those with NCDs, it is possible to ob-\nserve NCDs without neuroimaging abnormalities, and vice versa. Specialized techniques\n(e.g., diffusion tensor imaging) may reveal damage to specific white matter tracts. Mag-\nnetic resonance spectroscopy may reveal reduction in N-acetylaspartate, and increase in\nmarkers of inflammation (e.g., myoinositol) or white matter injury (e.g., choline). Many of\nthese brain imaging changes and neurocognitive manifestations reverse following suc-\ncessful abstinence. In individuals with methamphetamine use disorder, MRI may also re-\nveal hyperintensities suggestive of microhemorrhages or larger areas of infarction.\nFunctional Consequences of Substance\/Medication-\nInduced Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder\nThe functional consequences of substance\/medication-induced mild NCD are sometimes\naugmented by reduced cognitive efficiency and difficulty concentrating beyond that seen\nin many other NCDs. In addition, at both major and mild levels, substance\/medication-\ninduced NCDs may have associated motor syndromes that increase the level of functional\nimpairment. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nIndividuals with substance use disorders, substance intoxication, and substance withdrawal\nare at increased risk for other conditions that may independently, or through a compounding\neffect, result in neurocognitive disturbance. These include history of traumatic brain injury\nand infections that can accompany substance use disorder (e.g., HIV, hepatitis C virus, syph-\nilis). Therefore, presence of substance\/medication-induced major or mild NCD should be\ndifferentiated from NCDs arising outside the context of substance use, intoxication, and with-\ndrawal, including these accompanying conditions (e.g., traumatic brain injury).\n632\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nComorbidity\nSubstance use disorders, substance intoxication, and substance withdrawal are highly co-\nmorbid with other mental disorders. Comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder, psychotic\ndisorders, depressive and bipolar disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders can con-\ntribute to neurocognitive impairment in substance users. Traumatic brain injury occurs\nmore frequently with substance use, complicating efforts to determine the etiology of NCD\nin such cases. Severe, long-term alcohol use disorder can be associated with major organ\nsystem disease, including cerebrovascular disease and cirrhosis. Amphetamine-induced\nNCD may be accompanied by major or mild vascular NCD, also secondary to amphet-\namine use."}

(Note: Do\nnot use the additional code for HIV infection. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but\nshould still be indicated in writing.)\nDiagnostic Features \nHIV disease is caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1),\nwhich is acquired through exposure to bodily fluids of an infected person through injection\ndrug use, unprotected sexual contact, or accidental or iatrogenic exposure (e.g., contami-\nnated blood supply, needle puncture injury to medical personnel). HIV infects several types\nof cells, most particularly immune cells. Over time, the infection can cause severe depletion\nof “T-helper” (CD4) lymphocytes, resulting in severe immunocompromise, often leading to\nopportunistic infections and neoplasms. This advanced form of HIV infection is termed\nacquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Diagnosis of HIV is confirmed by established\nlaboratory methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV antibody with\nWestern blot confirmation and\/or polymerase chain reaction–based assays for HIV. \nSome individuals with HIV infection develop an NCD, which generally shows a “sub-\ncortical pattern” with prominently impaired executive function, slowing of processing\nspeed, problems with more demanding attentional tasks, and difficulty in learning new\ninformation, but fewer problems with recall of learned information. In major NCD, slow-\ning may be prominent. Language difficulties, such as aphasia, are uncommon, although\nreductions in fluency may be observed. HIV pathogenic processes can affect any part of\nthe brain; therefore, other patterns are possible. \nMajor or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to HIV Infection\n633\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nMajor or mild NCD due to HIV infection is usually more prevalent in individuals with\nprior episodes of severe immunosuppression, high viral loads in the cerebrospinal fluid,\nand indicators of advanced HIV disease such as anemia and hypoalbuminemia. Individ-\nuals with advanced NCD may experience prominent neuromotor features such as severe\nincoordination, ataxia, and motor slowing. There may be loss of emotional control, includ-\ning aggressive or inappropriate affect or apathy. \nPrevalence\nDepending on stage of HIV disease, approximately one-third to over one-half of HIV-\ninfected individuals have at least mild neurocognitive disturbance, but some of these dis-\nturbances may not meet the full criteria for mild NCD. An estimated 25% of individuals\nwith HIV will have signs and symptoms that meet criteria for mild NCD, and in fewer than\n5% would criteria for major NCD be met. \nDevelopment and Course \nAn NCD due to HIV infection can resolve, improve, slowly worsen, or have a fluctuating\ncourse. Rapid progression to profound neurocognitive impairment is uncommon in the\ncontext of currently available combination antiviral treatment; consequently, an abrupt\nchange in mental status in an individual with HIV may prompt an evaluation of other\nmedical sources for the cognitive change, including secondary infections. Because HIV in-\nfection preferentially affects subcortical regions over the course of illness, including deep\nwhite matter, the progression of the disorder follows a “subcortical” pattern. Since HIV\ncan affect a variety of brain regions, and the illness can take on many different trajectories\ndepending on associated comorbidities and consequences of HIV, the overall course of an\nNCD due to HIV infection has considerable heterogeneity. A subcortical neurocognitive\nprofile may interact with age over the life course, when psychomotor slowing and motor\nimpairments such as slowed gait may occur as a consequence of other age-related condi-\ntions so that the overall progression may appear more pronounced in later life. \nIn developed countries, HIV disease is primarily a condition of adults, with acquisition\nvia risky behaviors (e.g., unprotected sex, injection drug use) beginning in late adolescence\nand peaking during young and middle adulthood. In developing countries, particularly\nsub-Saharan Africa, where HIV testing and antiretroviral treatments for pregnant women\nare not readily available, perinatal transmission is common. The NCD in such infants and\nchildren may present primarily as neurodevelopmental delay. As individuals treated for\nHIV survive into older age, additive and interactive neurocognitive effects of HIV and\naging, including other NCDs (e.g., due to Alzheimer’s disease, due to Parkinson’s dis-\nease), are possible. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nRisk and prognostic factors for HIV infection.\nRisk factors for HIV infection include injec-\ntion drug use, unprotected sex, and unprotected blood supply and other iatrogenic factors. \nRisk and prognostic factors for major or mild neurocognitive disorder due to HIV in-\nfection.\nParadoxically, NCD due to HIV infection has not declined significantly with the\nadvent of combined antiretroviral therapy, although the most severe presentations (con-\nsistent with the diagnosis of major NCD) have decreased sharply. Contributory factors\nmay include inadequate control of HIV in the central nervous system (CNS), the evolution\nof drug-resistant viral strains, the effects of chronic long-term systemic and brain inflam-\nmation, and the effects of comorbid factors such as aging, drug abuse, past history of CNS\ntrauma, and co-infections, such as with the hepatitis C virus. Chronic exposure to antiret-\nroviral drugs also raises the possibility of neurotoxicity, although this has not been defin-\nitively established. \n634\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nDiagnostic Markers\nSerum HIV testing is required for the diagnosis. In addition, HIV characterization of the cere-\nbrospinal fluid may be helpful if it reveals a disproportionately high viral load in cerebrospinal\nfluid versus in the plasma. Neuroimaging (i.e., magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) may reveal\nreduction in total brain volume, cortical thinning, reduction in white matter volume, and\npatchy areas of abnormal white matter (hyperintensities). MRI or lumbar puncture may be\nhelpful to exclude a specific medical condition such as cryptococcus infection or herpes en-\ncephalitis that may contribute to CNS changes in the context of AIDS. Specialized techniques\nsuch as diffusion tensor imaging may reveal damage to specific white matter tracts. \nFunctional Consequences of Major or Mild \nNeurocognitive Disorder Due to HIV Infection\nFunctional consequences of major or mild NCD due to HIV infection are variable across\nindividuals. Thus, impaired executive abilities and slowed information processing may\nsubstantially interfere with the complex disease management decisions required for ad-\nherence to the combined antiretroviral therapy regimen. The likelihood of comorbid dis-\nease may further create functional challenges. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nIn the presence of comorbidities, such as other infections (e.g., hepatitis C virus, syphilis),\ndrug abuse (e.g., methamphetamine abuse), or prior head injury or neurodevelopmental\nconditions, major or mild NCD due to HIV infection can be diagnosed provided there is ev-\nidence that infection with HIV has worsened any NCDs due to such preexisting or comorbid\nconditions. Among older adults, onset of neurocognitive decline related to cerebrovascular\ndisease or neurodegeneration (e.g., major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease) may\nneed to be differentiated. In general, stable, fluctuating (without progression) or improving\nneurocognitive status would favor an HIV etiology, whereas steady or stepwise deter-\nioration would suggest neurodegenerative or vascular etiology. Because more severe im-\nmunodeficiency can result in opportunistic infections of the brain (e.g., toxoplasmosis;\ncryptococcosis) and neoplasia (e.g., CNS lymphoma), sudden onset of an NCD or sudden\nworsening of that disorder demands active investigation of non-HIV etiologies.\nComorbidity\nHIV disease is accompanied by chronic systemic and neuro-inflammation that can be as-\nsociated with cerebrovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. These complications can\nbe part of the pathogenesis of major or mild NCD due to HIV infection. HIV frequently co-\noccurs with conditions such as substance use disorders when the substance has been in-\njected and other sexually transmitted disorders."}

(Note: Do\nnot use the additional code for prion disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but\nshould still be indicated in writing.)\nDiagnostic Features\nThe classification of major or mild neurocognitive disorder (NCD) due to prion disease in-\ncludes NCDs due to a group of subacute spongiform encephalopathies (including Creutz-\nfeldt-Jakob disease, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, kuru, Gerstmann-Sträussler-\nScheinker syndrome, and fatal insomnia) caused by transmissible agents known as prions.\nThe most common type is sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, typically referred to as\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Variant CJD is much rarer and is associated with trans-\nmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, also called “mad cow disease.” Typically,\nindividuals with CJD present with neurocognitive deficits, ataxia, and abnormal move-\nments such as myoclonus, chorea, or dystonia; a startle reflex is also common. Typically,\nthe history reveals rapid progression to major NCD over as little as 6 months, and thus the\ndisorder is typically seen only at the major level. However, many individuals with the dis-\norder may have atypical presentations, and the disease can be confirmed only by biopsy or\nat autopsy. Individuals with variant CJD may present with a greater preponderance of\npsychiatric symptoms, characterized a by low mood, withdrawal, and anxiety. Prion dis-\nease is typically not diagnosed without at least one of the characteristic biomarker fea-\ntures: recognized lesions on magnetic resonance imaging with DWI (diffusion-weighted\nimaging) or FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery), tau or 14-3-3 protein in cerebro-\nspinal fluid, characteristic triphasic waves on electroencephalogram, or, for rare familial\nforms, family history or genetic testing. \nPrevalence\nThe annual incidence of sporadic CJD is approximately one or two cases per million peo-\nple. Prevalence is unknown but very low given the short survival.\nDevelopment and Course\nPrion disease may develop at any age in adults—the peak age for the sporadic CJD is ap-\nproximately 67 years—although it has been reported to occur in individuals spanning the\nteenage years to late life. Prodromal symptoms of prion disease may include fatigue, anx-\niety, problems with appetite or sleeping, or difficulties with concentration. After several\nweeks, these symptoms may be followed by incoordination, altered vision, or abnormal\ngait or other movements that may be myoclonic, choreoathetoid, or ballistic, along with a\nrapidly progressive dementia. The disease typically progresses very rapidly to the major\nlevel of impairment over several months. More rarely, it can progress over 2 years and ap-\npear similar in its course to other NCDs.\n636\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nRisk Factors and Prognosis\nEnvironmental.\nCross-species transmission of prion infections, with agents that are\nclosely related to the human form, has been demonstrated (e.g., the outbreak of bovine\nspongiform encephalopathy inducing variant CJD in the United Kingdom during the mid-\n1990s). Transmission by corneal transplantation and by human growth factor injection has\nbeen documented, and anecdotal cases of transmission to health care workers have been\nreported.\nGenetic and physiological.\nThere is a genetic component in up to 15% of cases, associ-\nated with an autosomal dominant mutation.\nDiagnostic Markers\nPrion disease can be definitively confirmed only by biopsy or at autopsy. Although there are\nno distinctive findings on cerebrospinal fluid analysis across the prion diseases, reliable bio-\nmarkers are being developed and include 14-3-3 protein (particularly for sporadic CJD) as\nwell as tau protein. Magnetic resonance brain imaging is currently considered the most sen-\nsitive diagnostic test when DWI is performed, with the most common finding being multi-\nfocal gray matter hyperintensities in subcortical and cortical regions. In some individuals,\nthe electroencephalogram reveals periodic sharp, often triphasic and synchronous dis-\ncharges at a rate of 0.5–2 Hz at some point during the course of the disorder. \nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther major neurocognitive disorders.\nMajor NCD due to prion disease may appear\nsimilar in its course to other NCDs, but prion diseases are typically distinguished by their\nrapid progression and prominent cerebellar and motor symptoms."}

Behavioral disturbance\ncannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.)\nDiagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of major or mild neurocognitive disorder (NCD) due to Parkinson’s\ndisease is cognitive decline following the onset of Parkinson’s disease. The disturbance\nmust occur in the setting of established Parkinson’s disease (Criterion B), and deficits must\nhave developed gradually (Criterion C). The NCD is viewed as probably due to Parkinson’s\ndisease when there is no evidence of another disorder that might be contributing to the\ncognitive decline and when the Parkinson’s disease clearly precedes onset of the NCD. The\nNCD is considered possibly due to Parkinson’s disease either when there is no evidence of\nanother disorder that might be contributing to the cognitive decline or when the Parkin-\nson’s disease precedes onset of the NCD, but not both.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nFrequently present features include apathy, depressed mood, anxious mood, hallucina-\ntions, delusions, personality changes, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and\nexcessive daytime sleepiness. \nPrevalence \nThe prevalence of Parkinson’s disease in the United States steadily increases with age from\napproximately 0.5% between ages 65 and 69 to 3% at age 85 years and older. Parkinson’s\ndisease is more common in males than in females. Among individuals with Parkinson’s\ndisease, as many as 75% will develop a major NCD sometime in the course of their disease.\nThe prevalence of mild NCD in Parkinson’s disease has been estimated at 27%. \nDevelopment and Course\nOnset of Parkinson’s disease is typically between the sixth and ninth decades of life, with\nmost expression in the early 60s. Mild NCD often develops relatively early in the course of\nParkinson’s disease, whereas major impairment typically does not occur until late. \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nEnvironmental.\nRisk factors for Parkinson’s disease include exposure to herbicides and\npesticides.\nGenetic and physiological.\nPotential risk factors for NCD among individuals with Par-\nkinson’s disease include older age at disease onset and increasing duration of disease. \nDiagnostic Markers\nNeuropsychological testing, with a focus on tests that do not rely on motor function, is crit-\nical in detecting the core cognitive deficits, particularly at the mild NCD phase. Structural\nneuroimaging and dopamine transporter scans, such as DaT scans, may differentiate\nLewy body–related dementias (Parkinson’s and dementia with Lewy bodies) from non–\n638\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nLewy body–related dementias (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease) and can sometimes be helpful in\nthe evaluation of major or mild NCD due to Parkinson’s disease.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nMajor or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies.\nThis distinction is based sub-\nstantially on the timing and sequence of motor and cognitive symptoms. For NCD to be at-\ntributed to Parkinson’s disease, the motor and other symptoms of Parkinson’s disease must\nbe present well before (by convention, at least 1 year prior) cognitive decline has reached\nthe level of major NCD, whereas in major or mild NCD with Lewy bodies, cognitive symp-\ntoms begin shortly before, or concurrent with, motor symptoms. For mild NCD, the timing\nis harder to establish because the diagnosis itself is less clear and the two disorders exist on\na continuum. Unless Parkinson’s disease has been established for some time prior to the\nonset of cognitive decline, or typical features of major or mild NCD with Lewy bodies are\npresent, it is preferable to diagnose unspecified mild NCD.\nMajor or mild neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease.\nThe motor features\nare the key to distinguishing major or mild NCD due to Parkinson’s disease from major or\nmild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease. However, the two disorders can co-occur.\nMajor or mild vascular neurocognitive disorder.\nMajor or mild vascular NCD may pre-\nsent with parkinsonian features such as psychomotor slowing that may occur as a conse-\nquence of subcortical small vessel disease. However, the parkinsonian features typically\nare not sufficient for a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, and the course of the NCD usually\nhas a clear association with cerebrovascular changes.\nNeurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition (e.g., neurodegenerative\ndisorders).\nWhen a diagnosis of major or mild NCD due to Parkinson’s disease is being\nconsidered, the distinction must also be made from other brain disorders, such as progres-\nsive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, multiple system atrophy, tumors, and\nhydrocephalus. \nNeuroleptic-induced parkinsonism.\nNeuroleptic-induced parkinsonism can occur in\nindividuals with other NCDs, particularly when dopamine-blocking drugs are prescribed\nfor the behavioral manifestations of such disorders\nOther medical conditions.\nDelirium and NCDs due to side effects of dopamine-blocking\ndrugs and other medical conditions (e.g., sedation or impaired cognition, severe hypothy-\nroidism, B12 deficiency) must also be ruled out. \nComorbidity \nParkinson’s disease may coexist with Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular disease, espe-\ncially in older individuals. The compounding of multiple pathological features may diminish\nthe functional abilities of individuals with Parkinson’s disease. Motor symptoms and frequent\nco-occurrence of depression or apathy can make functional impairment worse."}

Behavioral disturbance\ncannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.)\nDiagnostic Features\nProgressive cognitive impairment is a core feature of Huntington’s disease, with early changes\nin executive function (i.e., processing speed, organization, and planning) rather than learn-\ning and memory. Cognitive and associated behavioral changes often precede the emergence\nof the typical motor abnormalities of bradykinesia (i.e., slowing of voluntary movement)\nand chorea (i.e., involuntary jerking movements). A diagnosis of definite Huntington’s dis-\nease is given in the presence of unequivocal, extrapyramidal motor abnormalities in an in-\ndividual with either a family history of Huntington’s disease or genetic testing showing a\nCAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene, located on chromosome 4.\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nDepression, irritability, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and apathy are fre-\nquently, and psychosis more rarely, associated with Huntington’s disease and often pre-\ncede the onset of motor symptoms.\nPrevalence\nNeurocognitive deficits are an eventual outcome of Huntington’s disease; the worldwide\nprevalence is estimated to be 2.7 per 100,000. The prevalence of Huntington’s disease in\nNorth America, Europe, and Australia is 5.7 per 100,000, with a much lower prevalence of\n0.40 per 100,000 in Asia. \nDevelopment and Course\nThe average age at diagnosis of Huntington’s disease is approximately 40 years, although\nthis varies widely. Age at onset is inversely correlated with CAG expansion length. Juve-\nnile Huntington’s disease (onset before age 20) may present more commonly with brady-\nkinesia, dystonia, and rigidity than with the choreic movements characteristic of the adult-\nonset disorder. The disease is gradually progressive, with median survival approximately\n15 years after motor symptom diagnosis.\nPhenotypic expression of Huntington’s disease varies by presence of motor, cognitive,\nand psychiatric symptoms. Psychiatric and cognitive abnormalities can predate the motor\nabnormality by at least 15 years. Initial symptoms requiring care often include irritabity,\nanxiety, or depressed mood. Other behavioral disturbances may include pronounced ap-\nathy, disinhibition, impulsivity, and impaired insight, with apathy often becoming more\nprogressive over time. Early movement symptoms may involve the appearance of fidget-\niness of the extremities as well as mild apraxia (i.e., difficulty with purposeful movements),\nparticularly with fine motor tasks. As the disorder progresses, other motor problems in-\nclude impaired gait (ataxia) and postural instability. Motor impairment eventually affects\nspeech production (dysarthria) such that the speech becomes very difficult to understand,\n640\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nwhich may result in significant distress resulting from the communication barrier in the\ncontext of comparatively intact cognition. Advanced motor disease severely affects gait\nwith progressive ataxia. Eventually individuals become nonambulatory. End-stage motor\ndisease impairs motor control of eating and swallowing, typically a major contributor to\nthe death of the individual from aspiration pneumonia.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors \nGenetic and physiological.\nThe genetic basis of Huntington’s disease is a fully penetrant\nautosomal dominant expansion of the CAG trincleotide, often called a CAG repeat in the\nhuntingtin gene. A repeat length of 36 or more is invariably associated with Huntington’s\ndisease, with longer repeat lengths associated with early age at onset. A CAG repeat length\nof 36 or more is invariably associated with Huntington’s disease.\nDiagnostic Markers\nGenetic testing is the primary laboratory test for the determination of Huntington’s dis-\nease, which is an autosomal dominant disorder with complete penetrance. The trinucleo-\ntide CAG is observed to have a repeat expansion in the gene that encodes huntingtin\nprotein on chromosome 4. A diagnosis of Huntington’s disease is not made in the presence\nof the gene expansion alone, but the diagnosis is made only after symptoms become man-\nifest. Some individuals with a positive family history request genetic testing in a presymp-\ntomatic stage. Associated features may also include neuroimaging changes; volume loss in\nthe basal ganglia, particularly the caudate nucleus and putamen, is well known to occur\nand progresses over the course of illness. Other structural and functional changes have\nbeen observed in brain imaging but remain research measures.\nFunctional Consequences of Major or Mild \nNeurocognitive Disorder Due to Huntington’s Disease\nIn the prodromal phase of illness and at early diagnosis, occupational decline is most com-\nmon, with most individuals reporting some loss of ability to engage in their typical work.\nThe emotional, behavioral, and cognitive aspects of Huntington’s disease, such as disin-\nhibition and personality changes, are highly associated with functional decline. Cognitive\ndeficits that contribute most to functional decline may include speed of processing, initi-\nation, and attention rather than memory impairment. Given that Huntington’s disease on-\nset occurs in productive years of life, it may have a very disruptive effect on performance\nin the work setting as well as social and family life. As the disease progresses, disability\nfrom problems such as impaired gait, dysarthria, and impulsive or irritable behaviors may\nsubstantially add to the level of impairment and daily care needs, over and above the care\nneeds attributable to the cognitive decline. Severe choreic movements may substantially\ninterfere with provision of care such as bathing, dressing, and toileting.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nOther mental disorders.\nEarly symptoms of Huntington’s disease may include instabil-\nity of mood, irritability, or compulsive behaviors that may suggest another mental disor-\nder. However, genetic testing or the development of motor symptoms will distinguish the\npresence of Huntington’s disease.\nOther neurocognitive disorders.\nThe early symptoms of Huntington’s disease, particu-\nlarly symptoms of executive dysfunction and impaired psychomotor speed, may resemble\nother neurocognitive disorders (NCDs), such as major or mild vascular NCD.\nMajor or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\n641\nOther movement disorders.\nHuntington’s disease must also be differentiated from other\ndisorders or conditions associated with chorea, such as Wilson’s disease, drug-induced\ntardive dyskinesia, Sydenham’s chorea, systemic lupus erythematosus, or senile chorea.\nRarely, individuals may present with a course similar to that of Huntington’s disease but\nwithout positive genetic testing; this is considered to be a Huntington’s disease pheno-\ncopy that results from a variety of potential genetic factors."}
