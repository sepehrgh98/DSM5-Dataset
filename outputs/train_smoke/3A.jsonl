Based strictly on the 'Diagnostic Criteria' section below, write exactly 3 multiple-choice questions (MCQs): one EASY, one MODERATE, and one HARD. Each MCQ must have one correct answer and three plausible but clearly incorrect distractors. Do not use knowledge outside of the provided section.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Criteria]\n309.21 (F93.0)\nA. Developmentally inappropriate and excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation from\nthose to whom the individual is attached, as evidenced by at least three of the following:\n1. Recurrent excessive distress when anticipating or experiencing separation from\nhome or from major attachment figures.\nSeparation Anxiety Disorder\n191\n2. Persistent and excessive worry about losing major attachment figures or about pos-\nsible harm to them, such as illness, injury, disasters, or death.\n3. Persistent and excessive worry about experiencing an untoward event (e.g., getting\nlost, being kidnapped, having an accident, becoming ill) that causes separation\nfrom a major attachment figure.\n4. Persistent reluctance or refusal to go out, away from home, to school, to work, or\nelsewhere because of fear of separation.\n5. Persistent and excessive fear of or reluctance about being alone or without major\nattachment figures at home or in other settings.\n6. Persistent reluctance or refusal to sleep away from home or to go to sleep without\nbeing near a major attachment figure.\n7. Repeated nightmares involving the theme of separation.\n8. Repeated complaints of physical symptoms (e.g., headaches, stomachaches, nau-\nsea, vomiting) when separation from major attachment figures occurs or is antici-\npated.\nB. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, lasting at least 4 weeks in children and\nadolescents and typically 6 months or more in adults.\nC. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, aca-\ndemic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\nD. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as refusing\nto leave home because of excessive resistance to change in autism spectrum disorder;\ndelusions or hallucinations concerning separation in psychotic disorders; refusal to go\noutside without a trusted companion in agoraphobia; worries about ill health or other\nharm befalling significant others in generalized anxiety disorder; or concerns about\nhaving an illness in illness anxiety disorder.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the above section. Do not draw from memory or outside knowledge.\n- Generate exactly 3 MCQs: one easy, one moderate, one hard.\n- Difficulty definitions:\n    * EASY = direct recall of one fact, definition, or obvious feature. Answerable from a single sentence.\n    * MODERATE = requires combining 2â€“3 criteria, features, or conditions. Some reasoning needed.\n    * HARD = requires subtle distinctions, exceptions, or differential diagnosis. May involve nuanced reasoning or contrasts.\n- Each MCQ must include:\n  - A difficulty label (\"easy\", \"moderate\", \"hard\").\n  - A correct answer that reuses exact DSM wording (not paraphrased).\n  - An evidence_quote field with the copied phrase from the section that supports the correct answer.\n  - Distractors that are realistic, plausible, and similar in tone/length, but clearly incorrect.\n- Avoid stigmatizing, sensational, or culturally inappropriate language.\n\nReturn your output as a JSON array in the following format:\n[\n  {\n    \"question\": \"What is the most characteristic feature of ...?\",\n    \"options\": [\"A. ...\", \"B. ...\", \"C. ...\", \"D. ...\"],\n    \"answer_index\": 1,\n    \"why_correct\": \"This is explicitly stated in the section...\",\n    \"why_incorrect\": [\"Not in the section\", \"Contradicts text\", \"Refers to another disorder\"],\n    \"difficulty\": \"easy | moderate | hard\",\n    \"evidence_quote\": \"Exact phrase copied from the section\",\n    \"hallucination_flag\": false,\n    \"sensitive\": false\n  },\n  ...\n]\n", "response": {"mcq_items": [{"question": "Which of the following is a required symptom for diagnosing Separation Anxiety Disorder according to the DSM criteria?", "options": ["A.
