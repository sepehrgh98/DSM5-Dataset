Scenarios must follow this distribution: 1 EASY, 2 MODERATE, 2 HARD.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Features]\nThe essential feature of separation anxiety disorder is excessive fear or anxiety concerning\nseparation from home or attachment figures. The anxiety exceeds what may be expected\ngiven the person’s developmental level (Criterion A). Individuals with separation anxiety\ndisorder have symptoms that meet at least three of the following criteria: They experience\nrecurrent excessive distress when separation from home or major attachment figures is an-\nticipated or occurs (Criterion A1). They worry about the well-being or death of attachment\nfigures, particularly when separated from them, and they need to know the whereabouts\nof their attachment figures and want to stay in touch with them (Criterion A2). They also\nworry about untoward events to themselves, such as getting lost, being kidnapped, or\nhaving an accident, that would keep them from ever being reunited with their major at-\ntachment figure (Criterion A3). Individuals with separation anxiety disorder are reluctant\nor refuse to go out by themselves because of separation fears (Criterion A4). They have\npersistent and excessive fear or reluctance about being alone or without major attachment\nfigures at home or in other settings. Children with separation anxiety disorder may be un-\nable to stay or go in a room by themselves and may display “clinging” behavior, staying\nclose to or “shadowing” the parent around the house, or requiring someone to be with\nthem when going to another room in the house (Criterion A5). They have persistent reluc-\ntance or refusal to go to sleep without being near a major attachment figure or to sleep\naway from home (Criterion A6). Children with this disorder often have difficulty at bed-\ntime and may insist that someone stay with them until they fall asleep. During the night,\nthey may make their way to their parents’ bed (or that of a significant other, such as a sib-\nling). Children may be reluctant or refuse to attend camp, to sleep at friends’ homes, or to\ngo on errands. Adults may be uncomfortable when traveling independently (e.g., sleeping\nin a hotel room). There may be repeated nightmares in which the content expresses the in-\n192\nAnxiety Disorders\ndividual’s separation anxiety (e.g., destruction of the family through fire, murder, or other\ncatastrophe) (Criterion A7). Physical symptoms (e.g., headaches, abdominal complaints,\nnausea, vomiting) are common in children when separation from major attachment fig-\nures occurs or is anticipated (Criterion A8). Cardiovascular symptoms such as palpitations,\ndizziness, and feeling faint are rare in younger children but may occur in adolescents and\nadults.\nThe disturbance must last for a period of at least 4 weeks in children and adolescents\nyounger than 18 years and is typically 6 months or longer in adults (Criterion B). However,\nthe duration criterion for adults should be used as a general guide, with allowance for\nsome degree of flexibility. The disturbance must cause clinically significant distress or im-\npairment in social, academic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Cri-\nterion C).\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above as source of truth.
