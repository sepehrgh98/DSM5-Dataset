Each must present overlapping symptoms, two possible diagnoses, and justify why one is preferred.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Features]\nPanic disorder refers to recurrent unexpected panic attacks (Criterion A). A panic attack is\nan abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes,\nand during which time four or more of a list of 13 physical and cognitive symptoms occur.\nThe term recurrent literally means more than one unexpected panic attack. The term unex-\npected refers to a panic attack for which there is no obvious cue or trigger at the time of oc-\ncurrence—that is, the attack appears to occur from out of the blue, such as when the\nindividual is relaxing or emerging from sleep (nocturnal panic attack). In contrast, expected\npanic attacks are attacks for which there is an obvious cue or trigger, such as a situation in\nwhich panic attacks typically occur. The determination of whether panic attacks are ex-\npected or unexpected is made by the clinician, who makes this judgment based on a com-\nbination of careful questioning as to the sequence of events preceding or leading up to the\nattack and the individual’s own judgment of whether or not the attack seemed to occur for\nno apparent reason. Cultural interpretations may influence the assignment of panic at-\ntacks as expected or unexpected (see section “Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues” for this\ndisorder). In the United States and Europe, approximately one-half of individuals with\npanic disorder have expected panic attacks as well as unexpected panic attacks. Thus, the\npresence of expected panic attacks does not rule out the diagnosis of panic disorder. For\nmore details regarding expected versus unexpected panic attacks, see the text accompa-\nnying panic attacks (pp. 214–217).\nThe frequency and severity of panic attacks vary widely. In terms of frequency, there\nmay be moderately frequent attacks (e.g., one per week) for months at a time, or short\nbursts of more frequent attacks (e.g., daily) separated by weeks or months without any at-\ntacks or with less frequent attacks (e.g., two per month) over many years. Persons who\nhave infrequent panic attacks resemble persons with more frequent panic attacks in terms\nof panic attack symptoms, demographic characteristics, comorbidity with other disorders,\nfamily history, and biological data. In terms of severity, individuals with panic disorder\nmay have both full-symptom (four or more symptoms) and limited-symptom (fewer than\nfour symptoms) attacks, and the number and type of panic attack symptoms frequently\ndiffer from one panic attack to the next. However, more than one unexpected full-symp-\ntom panic attack is required for the diagnosis of panic disorder.\nThe worries about panic attacks or their consequences usually pertain to physical con-\ncerns, such as worry that panic attacks reflect the presence of life-threatening illnesses\n(e.g., cardiac disease, seizure disorder); social concerns, such as embarrassment or fear of\nbeing judged negatively by others because of visible panic symptoms; and concerns about\nmental functioning, such as “going crazy” or losing control (Criterion B). The maladaptive\nchanges in behavior represent attempts to minimize or avoid panic attacks or their conse-\nquences. Examples include avoiding physical exertion, reorganizing daily life to ensure\nthat help is available in the event of a panic attack, restricting usual daily activities, and\navoiding agoraphobia-type situations, such as leaving home, using public transportation,\nor shopping. If agoraphobia is present, a separate diagnosis of agoraphobia is given.\n210\nAnxiety Disorders\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each should present a timeline of symptoms that could fit two disorders, and require contrastive reasoning based on onset, progression, or duration.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Development Course]\nThe median age at onset for panic disorder in the United States is 20–24 years. A small\nnumber of cases begin in childhood, and onset after age 45 years is unusual but can occur.\nThe usual course, if the disorder is untreated, is chronic but waxing and waning. Some in-\ndividuals may have episodic outbreaks with years of remission in between, and others\nmay have continuous severe symptomatology. Only a minority of individuals have full\nremission without subsequent relapse within a few years. The course of panic disorder\ntypically is complicated by a range of other disorders, in particular other anxiety disor-\nders, depressive disorders, and substance use disorders (see section “Comorbidity” for\nthis disorder).\nAlthough panic disorder is very rare in childhood, first occurrence of “fearful spells” is\noften dated retrospectively back to childhood. As in adults, panic disorder in adolescents\ntends to have a chronic course and is frequently comorbid with other anxiety, depressive,\nand bipolar disorders. To date, no differences in the clinical presentation between adoles-\ncents and adults have been found. However, adolescents may be less worried about addi-\ntional panic attacks than are young adults. Lower prevalence of panic disorder in older\nadults appears to be attributable to age-related “dampening” of the autonomic nervous\nsystem response. Many older individuals with “panicky feelings” are observed to have a\n“hybrid” of limited-symptom panic attacks and generalized anxiety. Also, older adults\nPanic Disorder\n211\ntend to attribute their panic attacks to certain stressful situations, such as a medical pro-\ncedure or social setting. Older individuals may retrospectively endorse explanations for\nthe panic attack (which would preclude the diagnosis of panic disorder), even if an attack\nmight actually have been unexpected in the moment (and thus qualify as the basis for a\npanic disorder diagnosis). This may result in under-endorsement of unexpected panic at-\ntacks in older individuals. Thus, careful questioning of older adults is required to assess\nwhether panic attacks were expected before entering the situation, so that unexpected\npanic attacks and the diagnosis of panic disorder are not overlooked.\nWhile the low rate of panic disorder in children could relate to difficulties in symptom\nreporting, this seems unlikely given that children are capable of reporting intense fear or\npanic in relation to separation and to phobic objects or phobic situations. Adolescents\nmight be less willing than adults to openly discuss panic attacks. Therefore, clinicians\nshould be aware that unexpected panic attacks do occur in adolescents, much as they do in\nadults, and be attuned to this possibility when encountering adolescents presenting with\nepisodes of intense fear or distress.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Also, cultural ex-\npectations may influence the classification of panic attacks as expected or unexpected. For\nexample, a Vietnamese individual who has a panic attack after walking out into a windy\nenvironment (trúng gió; “hit by the wind”) may attribute the panic attack to exposure to\nwind as a result of the cultural syndrome that links these two experiences, resulting in clas-\nsification of the panic attack as expected. Various other cultural syndromes are associated\nwith panic disorder, including ataque de nervios (“attack of nerves”) among Latin Ameri-\ncans and khyâl attacks and “soul loss” among Cambodians. Ataque de nervios may involve\ntrembling, uncontrollable screaming or crying, aggressive or suicidal behavior, and deper-\nsonalization or derealization, which may be experienced longer than the few minutes typical\n212\nAnxiety Disorders\nof panic attacks. Some clinical presentations of ataque de nervios fulfill criteria for condi-\ntions other than panic attack (e.g., other specified dissociative disorder). These syndromes\nimpact the symptoms and frequency of panic disorder, including the individual’s attribu-\ntion of unexpectedness, as cultural syndromes may create fear of certain situations, rang-\ning from interpersonal arguments (associated with ataque de nervios), to types of exertion\n(associated with khyâl attacks), to atmospheric wind (associated with trúng gió attacks).\nClarification of the details of cultural attributions may aid in distinguishing expected and\nunexpected panic attacks. For more information regarding cultural syndromes, refer to the\n“Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the Appendix.\nThe specific worries about panic attacks or their consequences are likely to vary from\none culture to another (and across different age groups and gender). For panic disorder,\nU.S. community samples of non-Latino whites have significantly less functional impair-\nment than African Americans. There are also higher rates of objectively defined severity in\nnon-Latino Caribbean blacks with panic disorder, and lower rates of panic disorder over-\nall in both African American and Afro-Caribbean groups, suggesting that among individ-\nuals of African descent, the criteria for panic disorder may be met only when there is\nsubstantial severity and impairment.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each case should describe overlapping symptoms and require choosing between two similar disorders, with a contrastive justification.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Differential Diagnosis]\nOther specified anxiety disorder or unspecified anxiety disorder.\nPanic disorder should\nnot be diagnosed if full-symptom (unexpected) panic attacks have never been experienced. In\nPanic Disorder\n213\nthe case of only limited-symptom unexpected panic attacks, an other specified anxiety dis-\norder or unspecified anxiety disorder diagnosis should be considered.\nAnxiety disorder due to another medical condition.\nPanic disorder is not diagnosed if\nthe panic attacks are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of another medical\ncondition. Examples of medical conditions that can cause panic attacks include hyperthy-\nroidism, hyperparathyroidism, pheochromocytoma, vestibular dysfunctions, seizure dis-\norders, and cardiopulmonary conditions (e.g., arrhythmias, supraventricular tachycardia,\nasthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]). Appropriate laboratory tests\n(e.g., serum calcium levels for hyperparathyroidism; Holter monitor for arrhythmias) or\nphysical examinations (e.g., for cardiac conditions) may be helpful in determining the eti-\nological role of another medical condition.\nSubstance/medication-induced anxiety disorder.\nPanic disorder is not diagnosed if\nthe panic attacks are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a substance. In-\ntoxication with central nervous system stimulants (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines, caffeine)\nor cannabis and withdrawal from central nervous system depressants (e.g., alcohol, bar-\nbiturates) can precipitate a panic attack. However, if panic attacks continue to occur out-\nside of the context of substance use (e.g., long after the effects of intoxication or withdrawal\nhave ended), a diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered. In addition, because\npanic disorder may precede substance use in some individuals and may be associated\nwith increased substance use, especially for purposes of self-medication, a detailed history\nshould be taken to determine if the individual had panic attacks prior to excessive sub-\nstance use. If this is the case, a diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered in addition\nto a diagnosis of substance use disorder. Features such as onset after age 45 years or the\npresence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack (e.g., vertigo, loss of consciousness,\nloss of bladder or bowel control, slurred speech, amnesia) suggest the possibility that an-\nother medical condition or a substance may be causing the panic attack symptoms.\nOther mental disorders with panic attacks as an associated feature (e.g., other anxiety\ndisorders and psychotic disorders).\nPanic attacks that occur as a symptom of other anx-\niety disorders are expected (e.g., triggered by social situations in social anxiety disorder, by\nphobic objects or situations in specific phobia or agoraphobia, by worry in generalized anx-\niety disorder, by separation from home or attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder)\nand thus would not meet criteria for panic disorder. (Note: Sometimes an unexpected panic\nattack is associated with the onset of another anxiety disorder, but then the attacks become\nexpected, whereas panic disorder is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks.) If\nthe panic attacks occur only in response to specific triggers, then only the relevant anxiety\ndisorder is assigned. However, if the individual experiences unexpected panic attacks as\nwell and shows persistent concern and worry or behavioral change because of the attacks,\nthen an additional diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

The prevalence of panic disorder is elevated in individuals with other disorders,\nparticularly other anxiety disorders (and especially agoraphobia), major depression, bipo-\nlar disorder, and possibly mild alcohol use disorder.

In ap-\nproximately one-third of individuals with both disorders, the depression precedes the on-\nset of panic disorder. In the remaining two-thirds, depression occurs coincident with or\nfollowing the onset of panic disorder.

Each must present overlapping symptoms, two possible diagnoses, and justify why one is preferred.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Features]\nThe essential feature of generalized anxiety disorder is excessive anxiety and worry (ap-\nprehensive expectation) about a number of events or activities. The intensity, duration, or\nfrequency of the anxiety and worry is out of proportion to the actual likelihood or impact\nof the anticipated event. The individual finds it difficult to control the worry and to keep\nworrisome thoughts from interfering with attention to tasks at hand. Adults with gener-\nalized anxiety disorder often worry about everyday, routine life circumstances, such as\npossible job responsibilities, health and finances, the health of family members, misfor-\ntune to their children, or minor matters (e.g., doing household chores or being late for ap-\npointments). Children with generalized anxiety disorder tend to worry excessively about\ntheir competence or the quality of their performance. During the course of the disorder,\nthe focus of worry may shift from one concern to another.\nSeveral features distinguish generalized anxiety disorder from nonpathological anxiety.\nFirst, the worries associated with generalized anxiety disorder are excessive and typically in-\nterfere significantly with psychosocial functioning, whereas the worries of everyday life\nare not excessive and are perceived as more manageable and may be put off when more\npressing matters arise. Second, the worries associated with generalized anxiety disorder are\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder\n223\nmore pervasive, pronounced, and distressing; have longer duration; and frequently occur\nwithout precipitants. The greater the range of life circumstances about which a person\nworries (e.g., finances, children’s safety, job performance), the more likely his or her symp-\ntoms are to meet criteria for generalized anxiety disorder. Third, everyday worries are much\nless likely to be accompanied by physical symptoms (e.g., restlessness or feeling keyed up\nor on edge). Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder report subjective distress due\nto constant worry and related impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas\nof functioning.\nThe anxiety and worry are accompanied by at least three of the following additional\nsymptoms: restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty\nconcentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension, and disturbed sleep, al-\nthough only one additional symptom is required in children.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each should present a timeline of symptoms that could fit two disorders, and require contrastive reasoning based on onset, progression, or duration.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Development Course]\nMany individuals with generalized anxiety disorder report that they have felt anxious and\nnervous all of their lives. The median age at onset for generalized anxiety disorder is 30\nyears; however, age at onset is spread over a very broad range. The median age at onset is\nlater than that for the other anxiety disorders. The symptoms of excessive worry and anx-\niety may occur early in life but are then manifested as an anxious temperament. Onset of\nthe disorder rarely occurs prior to adolescence. The symptoms of generalized anxiety dis-\norder tend to be chronic and wax and wane across the lifespan, fluctuating between syn-\ndromal and subsyndromal forms of the disorder. Rates of full remission are very low.\nThe clinical expression of generalized anxiety disorder is relatively consistent across\nthe lifespan. The primary difference across age groups is in the content of the individual’s\nworry. Children and adolescents tend to worry more about school and sporting perfor-\nmance, whereas older adults report greater concern about the well-being of family or their\nown physical heath. Thus, the content of an individual’s worry tends to be age appropri-\nate. Younger adults experience greater severity of symptoms than do older adults.\nThe earlier in life individuals have symptoms that meet criteria for generalized anxiety\ndisorder, the more comorbidity they tend to have and the more impaired they are likely to\n224\nAnxiety Disorders\nbe. The advent of chronic physical disease can be a potent issue for excessive worry in the\nelderly. In the frail elderly, worries about safety—and especially about falling—may limit\nactivities. In those with early cognitive impairment, what appears to be excessive worry\nabout, for example, the whereabouts of things is probably better regarded as realistic\ngiven the cognitive impairment.\nIn children and adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder, the anxieties and wor-\nries often concern the quality of their performance or competence at school or in sporting\nevents, even when their performance is not being evaluated by others. There may be ex-\ncessive concerns about punctuality. They may also worry about catastrophic events, such\nas earthquakes or nuclear war. Children with the disorder may be overly conforming, per-\nfectionist, and unsure of themselves and tend to redo tasks because of excessive dissatis-\nfaction with less-than-perfect performance. They are typically overzealous in seeking\nreassurance and approval and require excessive reassurance about their performance and\nother things they are worried about.\nGeneralized anxiety disorder may be overdiagnosed in children. When this diagnosis\nis being considered in children, a thorough evaluation for the presence of other childhood\nanxiety disorders and other mental disorders should be done to determine whether the\nworries may be better explained by one of these disorders. Separation anxiety disorder, so-\ncial anxiety disorder (social phobia), and obsessive-compulsive disorder are often accom-\npanied by worries that may mimic those described in generalized anxiety disorder. For\nexample, a child with social anxiety disorder may be concerned about school performance\nbecause of fear of humiliation. Worries about illness may also be better explained by sep-\naration anxiety disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each case should describe overlapping symptoms and require choosing between two similar disorders, with a contrastive justification.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Differential Diagnosis]\nAnxiety disorder due to another medical condition.\nThe diagnosis of anxiety disorder\nassociated with another medical condition should be assigned if the individual’s anxiety\nand worry are judged, based on history, laboratory findings, or physical examination, to\nbe a physiological effect of another specific medical condition (e.g., pheochromocytoma,\nhyperthyroidism).\nSubstance/medication-induced anxiety disorder.\nA substance/medication-induced\nanxiety disorder is distinguished from generalized anxiety disorder by the fact that a sub-\nstance or medication (e.g., a drug of abuse, exposure to a toxin) is judged to be etiologically\nrelated to the anxiety. For example, severe anxiety that occurs only in the context of heavy\ncoffee consumption would be diagnosed as caffeine-induced anxiety disorder.\nSocial anxiety disorder.\nIndividuals with social anxiety disorder often have anticipa-\ntory anxiety that is focused on upcoming social situations in which they must perform or\nbe evaluated by others, whereas individuals with generalized anxiety disorder worry,\nwhether or not they are being evaluated.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nSeveral features distinguish the excessive worry of\ngeneralized anxiety disorder from the obsessional thoughts of obsessive-compulsive dis-\norder. In generalized anxiety disorder the focus of the worry is about forthcoming prob-\nlems, and it is the excessiveness of the worry about future events that is abnormal. In\nobsessive-compulsive disorder, the obsessions are inappropriate ideas that take the form of\nintrusive and unwanted thoughts, urges, or images.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder and adjustment disorders.\nAnxiety is invariably pres-\nent in posttraumatic stress disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder is not diagnosed if the\nanxiety and worry are better explained by symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder.\nAnxiety may also be present in adjustment disorder, but this residual category should be\nused only when the criteria are not met for any other disorder (including generalized anx-\niety disorder). Moreover, in adjustment disorders, the anxiety occurs in response to an\nidentifiable stressor within 3 months of the onset of the stressor and does not persist for\nmore than 6 months after the termination of the stressor or its consequences.\nDepressive, bipolar, and psychotic disorders.\nGeneralized anxiety/worry is a common\nassociated feature of depressive, bipolar, and psychotic disorders and should not be di-\n226\nAnxiety Disorders\nagnosed separately if the excessive worry has occurred only during the course of these\nconditions.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each should plausibly match two disorders, requiring a contrastive explanation to select the better fitting one.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Criteria]\nFor a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, it is necessary to meet the following criteria for a manic\nepisode. The manic episode may have been preceded by and may be followed by hypo-\nmanic or major depressive episodes.\n124\nBipolar and Related Disorders\nManic Episode\nA. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood\nand abnormally and persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy, lasting at\nleast 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospi-\ntalization is necessary).\nB. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or\nmore) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a sig-\nnificant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior:\n1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.\n2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).\n3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.\n4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.\n5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external\nstimuli), as reported or observed.\n6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or\npsychomotor agitation (i.e., purposeless non-goal-directed activity).\n7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful conse-\nquences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or\nfoolish business investments).\nC. The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or\noccupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or oth-\ners, or there are psychotic features.\nD. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug\nof abuse, a medication, other treatment) or to another medical condition.\nNote: A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medi-\ncation, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the\nphysiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and,\ntherefore, a bipolar I diagnosis.\nNote: Criteria A–D constitute a manic episode. At least one lifetime manic episode is re-\nquired for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.\nHypomanic Episode\nA. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood\nand abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 4 consec-\nutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day.\nB. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and activity, three (or\nmore) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) have persisted, rep-\nresent a noticeable change from usual behavior, and have been present to a significant\ndegree:\n1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.\n2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).\n3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.\n4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.\n5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external\nstimuli), as reported or observed.\n6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or\npsychomotor agitation.\n7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful conse-\nquences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or\nfoolish business investments).\nBipolar I Disorder\n125\nC. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is uncharac-\nteristic of the individual when not symptomatic.\nD. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable by others.\nE. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupa-\ntional functioning or to necessitate hospitalization. If there are psychotic features, the\nepisode is, by definition, manic.\nF. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug\nof abuse, a medication, other treatment).\nNote: A full hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g.,\nmedication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond\nthe physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a hypomanic episode\ndiagnosis. However, caution is indicated so that one or two symptoms (particularly in-\ncreased irritability, edginess, or agitation following antidepressant use) are not taken\nas sufficient for diagnosis of a hypomanic episode, nor necessarily indicative of a bi-\npolar diathesis.\nNote: Criteria A–F constitute a hypomanic episode. Hypomanic episodes are common in\nbipolar I disorder but are not required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.\nMajor Depressive Episode\nA. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week\nperiod and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms\nis either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.\nNote: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical condi-\ntion.\n1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjec-\ntive report (e.g., feels sad, empty, or hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g.,\nappears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)\n2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the\nday, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation).\n3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than\n5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every\nday. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)\n4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.\n5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others; not\nmerely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).\n6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.\n7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delu-\nsional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).\n8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (ei-\nther by subjective account or as observed by others).\n9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation with-\nout a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.\nB. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning.\nC. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another\nmedical condition.\nNote: Criteria A–C constitute a major depressive episode. Major depressive episodes are\ncommon in bipolar I disorder but are not required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.\nNote: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a\nnatural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense\n126\nBipolar and Related Disorders\nsadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Cri-\nterion A, which may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms may be un-\nderstandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive\nepisode in addition to the normal response to a significant loss should also be carefully\nconsidered. This decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on\nthe individual’s history and the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context\nof loss.1\nBipolar I Disorder\nA. Criteria have been met for at least one manic episode (Criteria A–D under “Manic Ep-\nisode” above).\nB. The occurrence of the manic and major depressive episode(s) is not better explained\nby schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional dis-\norder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic\ndisorder.\nCoding and Recording Procedures\nThe diagnostic code for bipolar I disorder is based on type of current or most recent epi-\nsode and its status with respect to current severity, presence of psychotic features, and\nremission status. Current severity and psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria\nare currently met for a manic or major depressive episode. Remission specifiers are only\nindicated if the full criteria are not currently met for a manic, hypomanic, or major depres-\nsive episode. Codes are as follows:\n1In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that in\ngrief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss, while in MDE it is persistent\ndepressed mood and the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is\nlikely to decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of\ngrief. These waves tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The\ndepressed mood of a MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations.\nThe pain of grief may be accompanied by positive emotions and humor that are uncharacteristic\nof the pervasive unhappiness and misery characteristic of a major depressive episode. The\nthought content associated with grief generally features a preoccupation with thoughts and\nmemories of the deceased, rather than the self-critical or pessimistic ruminations seen in a MDE.\nIn grief, self-esteem is generally preserved, whereas in a MDE, feelings of worthlessness and self-\nloathing are common. If self-derogatory ideation is present in grief, it typically involves per-\nceived failings vis-à-vis the deceased (e.g., not visiting frequently enough, not telling the\ndeceased how much he or she was loved). If a bereaved individual thinks about death and dying,\nsuch thoughts are generally focused on the deceased and possibly about “joining” the deceased,\nwhereas in a major depressive episode such thoughts are focused on ending one’s own life\nbecause of feeling worthless, undeserving of life, or unable to cope with the pain of depression.\nBipolar I disorder\nCurrent or\nmost recent\nepisode\nmanic\nCurrent or\nmost recent\nepisode\nhypomanic*\nCurrent or\nmost recent\nepisode\ndepressed\nCurrent or\nmost recent\nepisode\nunspecified**\nMild (p. 154)\n296.41\n(F31.11)\nNA\n296.51\n(F31.31)\nNA\nModerate (p. 154)\n296.42\n(F31.12)\nNA\n296.52\n(F31.32)\nNA\nSevere (p. 154)\n296.43\n(F31.13)\nNA\n296.53\n(F31.4)\nNA\nBipolar I Disorder\n127\nIn recording the name of a diagnosis, terms should be listed in the following order: bipolar\nI disorder, type of current or most recent episode, severity/psychotic/remission specifiers,\nfollowed by as many specifiers without codes as apply to the current or most recent epi-\nsode.\nSpecify:\nWith anxious distress (p. 149)\nWith mixed features (pp. 149–150)\nWith rapid cycling (pp. 150–151)\nWith melancholic features (p. 151)\nWith atypical features (pp. 151–152)\nWith mood-congruent psychotic features (p. 152)\nWith mood-incongruent psychotic features (p. 152)\nWith catatonia (p. 152).

Each must present overlapping symptoms, two possible diagnoses, and justify why one is preferred.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Features]\nThe essential feature of a manic episode is a distinct period during which there is an ab-\nnormally, persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and persistently increased\nactivity or energy that is present for most of the day, nearly every day, for a period of at\nleast 1 week (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary), accompanied by at least three\nadditional symptoms from Criterion B. If the mood is irritable rather than elevated or ex-\npansive, at least four Criterion B symptoms must be present.\nMood in a manic episode is often described as euphoric, excessively cheerful, high, or\n“feeling on top of the world.” In some cases, the mood is of such a highly infectious quality\nthat it is easily recognized as excessive and may be characterized by unlimited and hap-\nhazard enthusiasm for interpersonal, sexual, or occupational interactions. For example,\nthe individual may spontaneously start extensive conversations with strangers in public.\nOften the predominant mood is irritable rather than elevated, particularly when the indi-\nvidual’s wishes are denied or if the individual has been using substances. Rapid shifts in\nmood over brief periods of time may occur and are referred to as lability (i.e., the alterna-\nWith psychotic\nfeatures***\n(p. 152)\n296.44\n(F31.2)\nNA\n296.54\n(F31.5)\nNA\nIn partial\nremission (p. 154)\n296.45\n(F31.73)\n296.45\n(F31.71)\n296.55\n(F31.75)\nNA\nIn full remission\n(p. 154)\n296.46\n(F31.74)\n296.46\n(F31.72)\n296.56\n(F31.76)\nNA\nUnspecified\n296.40\n(F31.9)\n296.40\n(F31.9)\n296.50\n(F31.9)\nNA\n*Severity and psychotic specifiers do not apply; code 296.40 (F31.0) for cases not in remission.\n**Severity, psychotic, and remission specifiers do not apply.

In children, happiness, silliness and\n“goofiness” are normal in the context of special occasions; however, if these symptoms are\nrecurrent, inappropriate to the context, and beyond what is expected for the developmen-\ntal level of the child, they may meet Criterion A. If the happiness is unusual for a child (i.e.,\ndistinct from baseline), and the mood change occurs at the same time as symptoms that\nmeet Criterion B for mania, diagnostic certainty is increased; however, the mood change\nmust be accompanied by persistently increased activity or energy levels that are obvious\nto those who know the child well.\nDuring the manic episode, the individual may engage in multiple overlapping new\nprojects. The projects are often initiated with little knowledge of the topic, and nothing seems\nout of the individual’s reach. The increased activity levels may manifest at unusual hours of\nthe day.\nInflated self-esteem is typically present, ranging from uncritical self-confidence to marked\ngrandiosity, and may reach delusional proportions (Criterion B1). Despite lack of any partic-\nular experience or talent, the individual may embark on complex tasks such as writing a novel\nor seeking publicity for some impractical invention. Grandiose delusions (e.g., of having a\nspecial relationship to a famous person) are common. In children, overestimation of abilities\nand belief that, for example, they are the best at a sport or the smartest in the class is normal;\nhowever, when such beliefs are present despite clear evidence to the contrary or the child at-\ntempts feats that are clearly dangerous and, most important, represent a change from the\nchild’s normal behavior, the grandiosity criterion should be considered satisfied.\nOne of the most common features is a decreased need for sleep (Criterion B2) and is\ndistinct from insomnia in which the individual wants to sleep or feels the need to sleep but\nis unable. The individual may sleep little, if at all, or may awaken several hours earlier than\nusual, feeling rested and full of energy. When the sleep disturbance is severe, the individ-\nual may go for days without sleep, yet not feel tired. Often a decreased need for sleep her-\nalds the onset of a manic episode.\nSpeech can be rapid, pressured, loud, and difficult to interrupt (Criterion B3). Individ-\nuals may talk continuously and without regard for others’ wishes to communicate, often\nin an intrusive manner or without concern for the relevance of what is said. Speech is\nsometimes characterized by jokes, puns, amusing irrelevancies, and theatricality, with\ndramatic mannerisms, singing, and excessive gesturing. Loudness and forcefulness of\nspeech often become more important than what is conveyed. If the individual’s mood is\nmore irritable than expansive, speech may be marked by complaints, hostile comments, or\nangry tirades, particularly if attempts are made to interrupt the individual. Both Criterion\nA and Criterion B symptoms may be accompanied by symptoms of the opposite (i.e., de-\npressive) pole (see “with mixed features” specifier, pp. 149–150).\nOften the individual’s thoughts race at a rate faster than they can be expressed through\nspeech (Criterion B4). Frequently there is flight of ideas evidenced by a nearly continuous flow\nof accelerated speech, with abrupt shifts from one topic to another. When flight of ideas is se-\nvere, speech may become disorganized, incoherent, and particularly distressful to the individ-\nual. Sometimes thoughts are experienced as so crowded that it is very difficult to speak.\nDistractibility (Criterion B5) is evidenced by an inability to censor immaterial external\nstimuli (e.g., the interviewer’s attire, background noises or conversations, furnishings in\nthe room) and often prevents individuals experiencing mania from holding a rational con-\nversation or attending to instructions.\nThe increase in goal-directed activity often consists of excessive planning and partici-\npation in multiple activities, including sexual, occupational, political, or religious activi-\nties. Increased sexual drive, fantasies, and behavior are often present. Individuals in a manic\nepisode usually show increased sociability (e.g., renewing old acquaintances or calling or\ncontacting friends or even strangers), without regard to the intrusive, domineering, and\ndemanding nature of these interactions. They often display psychomotor agitation or rest-\nlessness (i.e., purposeless activity) by pacing or by holding multiple conversations simulta-\nBipolar I Disorder\n129\nneously. Some individuals write excessive letters, e-mails, text messages, and so forth, on\nmany different topics to friends, public figures, or the media.\nThe increased activity criterion can be difficult to ascertain in children; however, when\nthe child takes on many tasks simultaneously, starts devising elaborate and unrealistic\nplans for projects, develops previously absent and developmentally inappropriate sexual\npreoccupations (not accounted for by sexual abuse or exposure to sexually explicit mate-\nrial), then Criterion B might be met based on clinical judgment. It is essential to determine\nwhether the behavior represents a change from the child’s baseline behavior; occurs most\nof the day, nearly every day for the requisite time period; and occurs in temporal associa-\ntion with other symptoms of mania.\nThe expansive mood, excessive optimism, grandiosity, and poor judgment often lead\nto reckless involvement in activities such as spending sprees, giving away possessions,\nreckless driving, foolish business investments, and sexual promiscuity that is unusual for\nthe individual, even though these activities are likely to have catastrophic consequences\n(Criterion B7). The individual may purchase many unneeded items without the money to\npay for them and, in some cases, give them away. Sexual behavior may include infidelity\nor indiscriminate sexual encounters with strangers, often disregarding the risk of sexually\ntransmitted diseases or interpersonal consequences.\nThe manic episode must result in marked impairment in social or occupational func-\ntioning or require hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others (e.g., financial losses, il-\nlegal activities, loss of employment, self-injurious behavior). By definition, the presence of\npsychotic features during a manic episode also satisfies Criterion C.\nManic symptoms or syndromes that are attributable to the physiological effects of a\ndrug of abuse (e.g., in the context of cocaine or amphetamine intoxication), the side effects\nof medications or treatments (e.g., steroids, L-dopa, antidepressants, stimulants), or an-\nother medical condition do not count toward the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. However,\na fully syndromal manic episode that arises during treatment (e.g., with medications, elec-\ntroconvulsive therapy, light therapy) or drug use and persists beyond the physiological ef-\nfect of the inducing agent (i.e., after a medication is fully out of the individual’s system or\nthe effects of electroconvulsive therapy would be expected to have dissipated completely)\nis sufficient evidence for a manic episode diagnosis (Criterion D). Caution is indicated so\nthat one or two symptoms (particularly increased irritability, edginess, or agitation follow-\ning antidepressant use) are not taken as sufficient for diagnosis of a manic or hypomanic\nepisode, nor necessarily an indication of a bipolar disorder diathesis. It is necessary to\nmeet criteria for a manic episode to make a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, but it is not re-\nquired to have hypomanic or major depressive episodes. However, they may precede or\nfollow a manic episode. Full descriptions of the diagnostic features of a hypomanic epi-\nsode may be found within the text for bipolar II disorder, and the features of a major de-\npressive episode are described within the text for major depressive disorder.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Special considerations are necessary to detect the di-\nagnosis in children. Since children of the same chronological age may be at different\ndevelopmental stages, it is difficult to define with precision what is “normal” or “ex-\npected” at any given point. Therefore, each child should be judged according to his or her\nown baseline. Onset occurs throughout the life cycle, including first onsets in the 60s or\n70s.

Each case should describe overlapping symptoms and require choosing between two similar disorders, with a contrastive justification.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Differential Diagnosis]\nMajor depressive disorder.\nMajor depressive disorder may also be accompanied by hy-\npomanic or manic symptoms (i.e., fewer symptoms or for a shorter duration than required\nfor mania or hypomania). When the individual presents in an episode of major depression,\none must depend on corroborating history regarding past episodes of mania or hypoma-\nnia. Symptoms of irritability may be associated with either major depressive disorder or\nbipolar disorder, adding to diagnostic complexity.\nOther bipolar disorders.\nDiagnosis of bipolar I disorder is differentiated from bipolar II\ndisorder by determining whether there have been any past episodes of mania. Other spec-\nified and unspecified bipolar and related disorders should be differentiated from bipolar I\nand II disorders by considering whether either the episodes involving manic or hypo-\nmanic symptoms or the episodes of depressive symptoms fail to meet the full criteria for\nthose conditions.\nBipolar disorder due to another medical condition may be distinguished from bipolar\nI and II disorders by identifying, based on best clinical evidence, a causally related medical\ncondition.\nGeneralized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, or other\nanxiety disorders.\nThese disorders need to be considered in the differential diagnosis as\neither the primary disorder or, in some cases, a comorbid disorder. A careful history of\nsymptoms is needed to differentiate generalized anxiety disorder from bipolar disorder,\nas anxious ruminations may be mistaken for racing thoughts, and efforts to minimize anx-\nious feelings may be taken as impulsive behavior. Similarly, symptoms of posttraumatic\nstress disorder need to be differentiated from bipolar disorder. It is helpful to assess the ep-\nisodic nature of the symptoms described, as well as to consider symptom triggers, in mak-\ning this differential diagnosis.\nSubstance/medication-induced bipolar disorder.\nSubstance use disorders may mani-\nfest with substance.medication-induced manic symptoms that must be distinguished\nfrom bipolar I disorder; response to mood stabilizers during a substance/medication-\ninduced mania may not necessarily be diagnostic for bipolar disorder. There may be sub-\nstantial overlap in view of the tendency for individuals with bipolar I disorder to overuse\nsubstances during an episode. A primary diagnosis of bipolar disorder must be estab-\nlished based on symptoms that remain once substances are no longer being used.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nThis disorder may be misdiagnosed as bipolar\ndisorder, especially in adolescents and children. Many symptoms overlap with the symp-\n132\nBipolar and Related Disorders\ntoms of mania, such as rapid speech, racing thoughts, distractibility, and less need for\nsleep. The “double counting” of symptoms toward both ADHD and bipolar disorder can\nbe avoided if the clinician clarifies whether the symptom(s) represents a distinct episode.\nPersonality disorders.\nPersonality disorders such as borderline personality disorder\nmay have substantial symptomatic overlap with bipolar disorders, since mood lability\nand impulsivity are common in both conditions. Symptoms must represent a distinct ep-\nisode, and the noticeable increase over baseline required for the diagnosis of bipolar dis-\norder must be present. A diagnosis of a personality disorder should not be made during an\nuntreated mood episode.\nDisorders with prominent irritability.\nIn individuals with severe irritability, particularly\nchildren and adolescents, care must be taken to apply the diagnosis of bipolar disorder\nonly to those who have had a clear episode of mania or hypomania—that is, a distinct time\nperiod, of the required duration, during which the irritability was clearly different from\nthe individual’s baseline and was accompanied by the onset of Criterion B symptoms.\nWhen a child’s irritability is persistent and particularly severe, the diagnosis of disruptive\nmood dysregulation disorder would be more appropriate. Indeed, when any child is being\nassessed for mania, it is essential that the symptoms represent a clear change from the\nchild’s typical behavior.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each should plausibly match two disorders, requiring a contrastive explanation to select the better fitting one.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Criteria]\nA. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week\nperiod and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms\nis either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.\nNote: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical condition.\n1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjec-\ntive report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g.,\nappears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)\n2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the\nday, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation).\nMajor Depressive Disorder\n161\n3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than\n5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day.\n(Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)\n4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.\n5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not\nmerely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).\n6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.\n7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delu-\nsional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).\n8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (ei-\nther by subjective account or as observed by others).\n9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation with-\nout a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.\nB. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\ntional, or other important areas of functioning.\nC. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or to another\nmedical condition.\nNote: Criteria A–C represent a major depressive episode.\nNote: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a nat-\nural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense sad-\nness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion A,\nwhich may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms may be understand-\nable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive episode in\naddition to the normal response to a significant loss should also be carefully considered. This\ndecision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual’s history\nand the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss.1\nD. The occurrence of the major depressive episode is not better explained by schizoaf-\nfective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or\nother specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.\nE. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode.\nNote: This exclusion does not apply if all of the manic-like or hypomanic-like episodes\nare substance-induced or are attributable to the physiological effects of another med-\nical condition.\n1In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that in\ngrief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss, while in MDE it is persistent\ndepressed mood and the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is\nlikely to decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of\ngrief. These waves tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The\ndepressed mood of MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations.\nThe pain of grief may be accompanied by positive emotions and humor that are uncharacteristic\nof the pervasive unhappiness and misery characteristic of MDE. The thought content associated\nwith grief generally features a preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the deceased,\nrather than the self-critical or pessimistic ruminations seen in MDE. In grief, self-esteem is gener-\nally preserved, whereas in MDE feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common. If self-\nderogatory ideation is present in grief, it typically involves perceived failings vis-à-vis the\ndeceased (e.g., not visiting frequently enough, not telling the deceased how much he or she was\nloved). If a bereaved individual thinks about death and dying, such thoughts are generally\nfocused on the deceased and possibly about “joining” the deceased, whereas in MDE such\nthoughts are focused on ending one’s own life because of feeling worthless, undeserving of life,\nor unable to cope with the pain of depression.\n162\nDepressive Disorders\nCoding and Recording Procedures\nThe diagnostic code for major depressive disorder is based on whether this is a single or\nrecurrent episode, current severity, presence of psychotic features, and remission status.\nCurrent severity and psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria are currently met\nfor a major depressive episode. Remission specifiers are only indicated if the full criteria\nare not currently met for a major depressive episode.

The defini-\ntions of specifiers are found on the indicated pages.\n**If psychotic features are present, code the “with psychotic features” specifier irrespective of epi-\nsode severity.\nMajor Depressive Disorder\n163\nThe essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period of at least 2 weeks during\nwhich there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activi-\nties (Criterion A). In children and adolescents, the mood may be irritable rather than sad.\nThe individual must also experience at least four additional symptoms drawn from a list\nthat includes changes in appetite or weight, sleep, and psychomotor activity; decreased en-\nergy; feelings of worthlessness or guilt; difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making deci-\nsions; or recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation or suicide plans or attempts. To\ncount toward a major depressive episode, a symptom must either be newly present or must\nhave clearly worsened compared with the person’s pre-episode status. The symptoms\nmust persist for most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 2 consecutive weeks. The ep-\nisode must be accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-\npational, or other important areas of functioning. For some individuals with milder\nepisodes, functioning may appear to be normal but requires markedly increased effort.\nThe mood in a major depressive episode is often described by the person as depressed,\nsad, hopeless, discouraged, or “down in the dumps” (Criterion A1). In some cases, sadness\nmay be denied at first but may subsequently be elicited by interview (e.g., by pointing out\nthat the individual looks as if he or she is about to cry). In some individuals who complain\nof feeling “blah,” having no feelings, or feeling anxious, the presence of a depressed mood\ncan be inferred from the person’s facial expression and demeanor. Some individuals em-\nphasize somatic complaints (e.g., bodily aches and pains) rather than reporting feelings of\nsadness. Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability (e.g., persistent anger, a\ntendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming others, an exaggerated\nsense of frustration over minor matters). In children and adolescents, an irritable or cranky\nmood may develop rather than a sad or dejected mood. This presentation should be dif-\nferentiated from a pattern of irritability when frustrated.\nLoss of interest or pleasure is nearly always present, at least to some degree. Individ-\nuals may report feeling less interested in hobbies, “not caring anymore,” or not feeling any\nenjoyment in activities that were previously considered pleasurable (Criterion A2). Family\nmembers often notice social withdrawal or neglect of pleasurable avocations (e.g., a for-\nmerly avid golfer no longer plays, a child who used to enjoy soccer finds excuses not to\npractice). In some individuals, there is a significant reduction from previous levels of sex-\nual interest or desire.\nAppetite change may involve either a reduction or increase. Some depressed individ-\nuals report that they have to force themselves to eat. Others may eat more and may crave\nspecific foods (e.g., sweets or other carbohydrates). When appetite changes are severe (in\neither direction), there may be a significant loss or gain in weight, or, in children, a failure\nto make expected weight gains may be noted (Criterion A3).\nSleep disturbance may take the form of either difficulty sleeping or sleeping exces-\nsively (Criterion A4). When insomnia is present, it typically takes the form of middle in-\nsomnia (i.e., waking up during the night and then having difficulty returning to sleep) or\nterminal insomnia (i.e., waking too early and being unable to return to sleep). Initial in-\nsomnia (i.e., difficulty falling asleep) may also occur. Individuals who present with over-\nsleeping (hypersomnia) may experience prolonged sleep episodes at night or increased\ndaytime sleep. Sometimes the reason that the individual seeks treatment is for the dis-\nturbed sleep.\nPsychomotor changes include agitation (e.g., the inability to sit still, pacing, hand-\nwringing; or pulling or rubbing of the skin, clothing, or other objects) or retardation (e.g.,\nslowed speech, thinking, and body movements; increased pauses before answering;\nspeech that is decreased in volume, inflection, amount, or variety of content, or muteness)\n(Criterion A5). The psychomotor agitation or retardation must be severe enough to be ob-\nservable by others and not represent merely subjective feelings.\nDecreased energy, tiredness, and fatigue are common (Criterion A6). A person may re-\nport sustained fatigue without physical exertion. Even the smallest tasks seem to require\n164\nDepressive Disorders\nsubstantial effort. The efficiency with which tasks are accomplished may be reduced. For\nexample, an individual may complain that washing and dressing in the morning are ex-\nhausting and take twice as long as usual.\nThe sense of worthlessness or guilt associated with a major depressive episode may in-\nclude unrealistic negative evaluations of one’s worth or guilty preoccupations or rumina-\ntions over minor past failings (Criterion A7). Such individuals often misinterpret neutral\nor trivial day-to-day events as evidence of personal defects and have an exaggerated sense\nof responsibility for untoward events. The sense of worthlessness or guilt may be of delu-\nsional proportions (e.g., an individual who is convinced that he or she is personally re-\nsponsible for world poverty). Blaming oneself for being sick and for failing to meet\noccupational or interpersonal responsibilities as a result of the depression is very common\nand, unless delusional, is not considered sufficient to meet this criterion.\nMany individuals report impaired ability to think, concentrate, or make even minor\ndecisions (Criterion A8). They may appear easily distracted or complain of memory diffi-\nculties. Those engaged in cognitively demanding pursuits are often unable to function. In\nchildren, a precipitous drop in grades may reflect poor concentration. In elderly individ-\nuals, memory difficulties may be the chief complaint and may be mistaken for early signs\nof a dementia (“pseudodementia”). When the major depressive episode is successfully\ntreated, the memory problems often fully abate. However, in some individuals, particu-\nlarly elderly persons, a major depressive episode may sometimes be the initial presenta-\ntion of an irreversible dementia.\nThoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts (Criterion A9) are common.\nThey may range from a passive wish not to awaken in the morning or a belief that others\nwould be better off if the individual were dead, to transient but recurrent thoughts of com-\nmitting suicide, to a specific suicide plan. More severely suicidal individuals may have put\ntheir affairs in order (e.g., updated wills, settled debts), acquired needed materials (e.g., a\nrope or a gun), and chosen a location and time to accomplish the suicide. Motivations for\nsuicide may include a desire to give up in the face of perceived insurmountable obstacles,\nan intense wish to end what is perceived as an unending and excruciatingly painful emo-\ntional state, an inability to foresee any enjoyment in life, or the wish to not be a burden to\nothers. The resolution of such thinking may be a more meaningful measure of diminished\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each should present a timeline of symptoms that could fit two disorders, and require contrastive reasoning based on onset, progression, or duration.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Development Course]\nMajor depressive disorder may first appear at any age, but the likelihood of onset in-\ncreases markedly with puberty. In the United States, incidence appears to peak in the 20s;\nhowever, first onset in late life is not uncommon.\nThe course of major depressive disorder is quite variable, such that some individuals\nrarely, if ever, experience remission (a period of 2 or more months with no symptoms, or\nonly one or two symptoms to no more than a mild degree), while others experience many\nyears with few or no symptoms between discrete episodes. It is important to distinguish\nindividuals who present for treatment during an exacerbation of a chronic depressive ill-\nness from those whose symptoms developed recently. Chronicity of depressive symptoms\nsubstantially increases the likelihood of underlying personality, anxiety, and substance\nuse disorders and decreases the likelihood that treatment will be followed by full symp-\ntom resolution. It is therefore useful to ask individuals presenting with depressive symp-\ntoms to identify the last period of at least 2 months during which they were entirely free of\ndepressive symptoms.\nRecovery typically begins within 3 months of onset for two in five individuals with ma-\njor depression and within 1 year for four in five individuals. Recency of onset is a strong\ndeterminant of the likelihood of near-term recovery, and many individuals who have been\ndepressed only for several months can be expected to recover spontaneously. Features as-\nsociated with lower recovery rates, other than current episode duration, include psychotic\nfeatures, prominent anxiety, personality disorders, and symptom severity.\nThe risk of recurrence becomes progessively lower over time as the duration of re-\nmission increases. The risk is higher in individuals whose preceding episode was severe,\nin younger individuals, and in individuals who have already experienced multiple epi-\nsodes. The persistence of even mild depressive symptoms during remission is a powerful\npredictor of recurrence.\nMany bipolar illnesses begin with one or more depressive episodes, and a substantial\nproportion of individuals who initially appear to have major depressive disorder will\nprove, in time, to instead have a bipolar disorder. This is more likely in individuals with\nonset of the illness in adolescence, those with psychotic features, and those with a family\nhistory of bipolar illness. The presence of a “with mixed features” specifier also increases\nthe risk for future manic or hypomanic diagnosis. Major depressive disorder, particularly\nwith psychotic features, may also transition into schizophrenia, a change that is much\nmore frequent than the reverse.\n166\nDepressive Disorders\nDespite consistent differences between genders in prevalence rates for depressive disor-\nders, there appear to be no clear differences by gender in phenomenology, course, or treat-\nment response. Similarly, there are no clear effects of current age on the course or treatment\nresponse of major depressive disorder. Some symptom differences exist, though, such that\nhypersomnia and hyperphagia are more likely in younger individuals, and melancholic\nsymptoms, particularly psychomotor disturbances, are more common in older individuals.\nThe likelihood of suicide attempts lessens in middle and late life, although the risk of com-\npleted suicide does not. Depressions with earlier ages at onset are more familial and more\nlikely to involve personality disturbances. The course of major depressive disorder within\nindividuals does not generally change with aging. Mean times to recovery appear to be sta-\nble over long periods, and the likelihood of being in an episode does not generally increase\nor decrease with time.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

This distinction requires a careful clinical evalua-\ntion of the presence of manic symptoms.\nMood disorder due to another medical condition.\nA major depressive episode is the\nappropriate diagnosis if the mood disturbance is not judged, based on individual history,\nphysical examination, and laboratory findings, to be the direct pathophysiological conse-\nquence of a specific medical condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis, stroke, hypothyroidism).\nSubstance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar disorder.\nThis disorder is distin-\nguished from major depressive disorder by the fact that a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse,\na medication, a toxin) appears to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance. For ex-\nample, depressed mood that occurs only in the context of withdrawal from cocaine would\nbe diagnosed as cocaine-induced depressive disorder.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nDistractibility and low frustration tolerance\ncan occur in both attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder and a major depressive epi-\nsode; if the criteria are met for both, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may be diag-\nnosed in addition to the mood disorder.

Because these symptoms have become a part of the individual’s\nday-to-day experience, particularly in the case of early onset (e.g., “I’ve always been this\n170\nDepressive Disorders\nway”), they may not be reported unless the individual is directly prompted.

Each case should describe overlapping symptoms and require choosing between two similar disorders, with a contrastive justification.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Differential Diagnosis]\nMajor depressive disorder.\nIf there is a depressed mood plus two or more symptoms\nmeeting criteria for a persistent depressive episode for 2 years or more, then the diagnosis of\npersistent depressive disorder is made. The diagnosis depends on the 2-year duration,\nwhich distinguishes it from episodes of depression that do not last 2 years. If the symptom\nPremenstrual Dysphoric Disorder\n171\ncriteria are sufficient for a diagnosis of a major depressive episode at any time during this pe-\nriod, then the diagnosis of major depression should be noted, but it is coded not as a separate\ndiagnosis but rather as a specifier with the diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder. If the\nindividual’s symptoms currently meet full criteria for a major depressive episode, then the\nspecifier of “with intermittent major depressive episodes, with current episode” would be\nmade. If the major depressive episode has persisted for at least a 2-year duration and re-\nmains present, then the specifier “with persistent major depressive episode” is used. When\nfull major depressive episode criteria are not currently met but there has been at least one\nprevious episode of major depression in the context of at least 2 years of persistent depres-\nsive symptoms, then the specifier of “with intermittent major depressive episodes, without\ncurrent episode” is used. If the individual has not experienced an episode of major depres-\nsion in the last 2 years, then the specifier “with pure dysthymic syndrome” is used.\nPsychotic disorders.\nDepressive symptoms are a common associated feature of chronic\npsychotic disorders (e.g., schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, delusional disorder). A\nseparate diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder is not made if the symptoms occur\nonly during the course of the psychotic disorder (including residual phases).\nDepressive or bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition.\nPersistent\ndepressive disorder must be distinguished from a depressive or bipolar and related dis-\norder due to another medical condition. The diagnosis is depressive or bipolar and related\ndisorder due to another medical condition if the mood disturbance is judged, based on his-\ntory, physical examination, or laboratory findings, to be attributable to the direct patho-\nphysiological effects of a specific, usually chronic, medical condition (e.g., multiple\nsclerosis). If it is judged that the depressive symptoms are not attributable to the physiolog-\nical effects of another medical condition, then the primary mental disorder (e.g., persistent\ndepressive disorder) is recorded, and the medical condition is noted as a concomitant med-\nical condition (e.g., diabetes mellitus).\nSubstance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar disorder.\nA substance/medi-\ncation-induced depressive or bipolar and related disorder is distinguished from persis-\ntent depressive disorder when a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, a toxin) is\njudged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance.\nPersonality disorders.\nOften, there is evidence of a coexisting personality disturbance.\nWhen an individual’s presentation meets the criteria for both persistent depressive disor-\nder and a personality disorder, both diagnoses are given.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each must present overlapping symptoms, two possible diagnoses, and justify why one is preferred.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Features]\nThere are three essential features of anorexia nervosa: persistent energy intake restriction;\nintense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes\nwith weight gain; and a disturbance in self-perceived weight or shape. The individual main-\ntains a body weight that is below a minimally normal level for age, sex, developmental tra-\njectory, and physical health (Criterion A). Individuals’ body weights frequently meet this\ncriterion following a significant weight loss, but among children and adolescents, there\nmay alternatively be failure to make expected weight gain or to maintain a normal devel-\nopmental trajectory (i.e., while growing in height) instead of weight loss.\n340\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\nCriterion A requires that the individual’s weight be significantly low (i.e., less than\nminimally normal or, for children and adolescents, less than that minimally expected).\nWeight assessment can be challenging because normal weight range differs among indi-\nviduals, and different thresholds have been published defining thinness or underweight\nstatus. Body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms/height in meters2) is a\nuseful measure to assess body weight for height. For adults, a BMI of 18.5 kg/m2 has been\nemployed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) as the lower limit of normal body weight. Therefore, most adults with\na BMI greater than or equal to 18.5 kg/m2 would not be considered to have a significantly\nlow body weight. On the other hand, a BMI of lower than 17.0 kg/m2 has been considered\nby the WHO to indicate moderate or severe thinness; therefore, an individual with a BMI\nless than 17.0 kg/m2 would likely be considered to have a significantly low weight. An\nadult with a BMI between 17.0 and 18.5 kg/m2, or even above 18.5 kg/m2, might be consid-\nered to have a significantly low weight if clinical history or other physiological informa-\ntion supports this judgment.\nFor children and adolescents, determining a BMI-for-age percentile is useful (see, e.g.,\nthe CDC BMI percentile calculator for children and teenagers. As for adults, it is not pos-\nsible to provide definitive standards for judging whether a child’s or an adolescent’s weight\nis significantly low, and variations in developmental trajectories among youth limit the\nutility of simple numerical guidelines. The CDC has used a BMI-for-age below the 5th per-\ncentile as suggesting underweight; however, children and adolescents with a BMI above\nthis benchmark may be judged to be significantly underweight in light of failure to main-\ntain their expected growth trajectory. In summary, in determining whether Criterion A is\nmet, the clinician should consider available numerical guidelines, as well as the individual’s\nbody build, weight history, and any physiological disturbances.\nIndividuals with this disorder typically display an intense fear of gaining weight or of\nbecoming fat (Criterion B). This intense fear of becoming fat is usually not alleviated by\nweight loss. In fact, concern about weight gain may increase even as weight falls. Younger\nindividuals with anorexia nervosa, as well as some adults, may not recognize or acknowl-\nedge a fear of weight gain. In the absence of another explanation for the significantly low\nweight, clinician inference drawn from collateral history, observational data, physical and\nlaboratory findings, or longitudinal course either indicating a fear of weight gain or sup-\nporting persistent behaviors that prevent it may be used to establish Criterion B.\nThe experience and significance of body weight and shape are distorted in these indi-\nviduals (Criterion C). Some individuals feel globally overweight. Others realize that they\nare thin but are still concerned that certain body parts, particularly the abdomen, buttocks,\nand thighs, are “too fat.” They may employ a variety of techniques to evaluate their body\nsize or weight, including frequent weighing, obsessive measuring of body parts, and per-\nsistent use of a mirror to check for perceived areas of “fat.” The self-esteem of individuals\nwith anorexia nervosa is highly dependent on their perceptions of body shape and weight.\nWeight loss is often viewed as an impressive achievement and a sign of extraordinary self-\ndiscipline, whereas weight gain is perceived as an unacceptable failure of self-control. Al-\nthough some individuals with this disorder may acknowledge being thin, they often do\nnot recognize the serious medical implications of their malnourished state.\nOften, the individual is brought to professional attention by family members after marked\nweight loss (or failure to make expected weight gains) has occurred. If individuals seek help\non their own, it is usually because of distress over the somatic and psychological sequelae\nof starvation. It is rare for an individual with anorexia nervosa to complain of weight loss\nper se. In fact, individuals with anorexia nervosa frequently either lack insight into or deny\nthe problem. It is therefore often important to obtain information from family members or\nother sources to evaluate the history of weight loss and other features of the illness.\nAnorexia Nervosa\n341\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

It rarely be-\ngins before puberty or after age 40, but cases of both early and late onset have been de-\nscribed. The onset of this disorder is often associated with a stressful life event, such as\nleaving home for college.

Clinicians should not exclude\nanorexia nervosa from the differential diagnosis solely on the basis of older age.\nMany individuals have a period of changed eating behavior prior to full criteria for the\ndisorder being met. Some individuals with anorexia nervosa recover fully after a single\nepisode, with some exhibiting a fluctuating pattern of weight gain followed by relapse,\nand others experiencing a chronic course over many years. Hospitalization may be re-\nquired to restore weight and to address medical complications. Most individuals with an-\norexia nervosa experience remission within 5 years of presentation. Among individuals\nadmitted to hospitals, overall remission rates may be lower. The crude mortality rate (CMR)\nfor anorexia nervosa is approximately 5% per decade.

The presentation of weight concerns among individuals\nwith eating and feeding disorders varies substantially across cultural contexts. The absence of\nan expressed intense fear of weight gain, sometimes referred to as “fat phobia,” appears to be\nrelatively more common in populations in Asia, where the rationale for dietary restriction is\ncommonly related to a more culturally sanctioned complaint such as gastrointestinal discom-\nfort.

Each case should describe overlapping symptoms and require choosing between two similar disorders, with a contrastive justification.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Differential Diagnosis]\nOther possible causes of either significantly low body weight or significant weight loss\nshould be considered in the differential diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, especially when the\npresenting features are atypical (e.g., onset after age 40 years).\nMedical conditions (e.g., gastrointestinal disease, hyperthyroidism, occult malignan-\ncies, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]).\nSerious weight loss may oc-\ncur in medical conditions, but individuals with these disorders usually do not also mani-\nfest a disturbance in the way their body weight or shape is experienced or an intense fear\nof weight gain or persist in behaviors that interfere with appropriate weight gain. Acute\nweight loss associated with a medical condition can occasionally be followed by the onset\nor recurrence of anorexia nervosa, which can initially be masked by the comorbid medical\ncondition. Rarely, anorexia nervosa develops after bariatric surgery for obesity.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nIn major depressive disorder, severe weight loss may occur,\nbut most individuals with major depressive disorder do not have either a desire for exces-\nsive weight loss or an intense fear of gaining weight.\nSchizophrenia.\nIndividuals with schizophrenia may exhibit odd eating behavior and oc-\ncasionally experience significant weight loss, but they rarely show the fear of gaining\nweight and the body image disturbance required for a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa.\nSubstance use disorders.\nIndividuals with substance use disorders may experience low\nweight due to poor nutritional intake but generally do not fear gaining weight and do not\nmanifest body image disturbance. Individuals who abuse substances that reduce appetite\n(e.g., cocaine, stimulants) and who also endorse fear of weight gain should be carefully\nevaluated for the possibility of comorbid anorexia nervosa, given that the substance use\nmay represent a persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain (Criterion B).\nSocial anxiety disorder (social phobia), obsessive-compulsive disorder, and body dys-\nmorphic disorder.\nSome of the features of anorexia nervosa overlap with the criteria for\nsocial phobia, OCD, and body dysmorphic disorder. Specifically, individuals may feel hu-\nmiliated or embarrassed to be seen eating in public, as in social phobia; may exhibit obses-\nsions and compulsions related to food, as in OCD; or may be preoccupied with an imagined\ndefect in bodily appearance, as in body dysmorphic disorder. If the individual with anorexia\nnervosa has social fears that are limited to eating behavior alone, the diagnosis of social pho-\nbia should not be made, but social fears unrelated to eating behavior (e.g., excessive fear of\nspeaking in public) may warrant an additional diagnosis of social phobia. Similarly, an ad-\nditional diagnosis of OCD should be considered only if the individual exhibits obsessions\nand compulsions unrelated to food (e.g., an excessive fear of contamination), and an addi-\ntional diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder should be considered only if the distortion is\nunrelated to body shape and size (e.g., preoccupation that one’s nose is too big).\nBulimia nervosa.\nIndividuals with bulimia nervosa exhibit recurrent episodes of binge\neating, engage in inappropriate behavior to avoid weight gain (e.g., self-induced vomit-\ning), and are overly concerned with body shape and weight. However, unlike individuals\nwith anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type, individuals with bulimia nervosa main-\ntain body weight at or above a minimally normal level.\nAvoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.\nIndividuals with this disorder may exhibit\nsignificant weight loss or significant nutritional deficiency, but they do not have a fear of\ngaining weight or of becoming fat, nor do they have a disturbance in the way they expe-\nrience their body shape and weight.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

{"uuid": "b7345172-beb6-4f44-a7ca-e9239c9c2d92", "disorder": "Bulimia Nervosa", "section": "diagnostic_features", "task": "3C", "qa_count": 2, "prompt": "Using the Diagnostic Features section, generate 2 contrastive diagnostic reasoning examples. Each must present overlapping symptoms, two possible diagnoses, and justify why one is preferred.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Features]\nThere are three essential features of bulimia nervosa: recurrent episodes of binge eating\n(Criterion A), recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain\n(Criterion B), and self-evaluation that is unduly influenced by body shape and weight\n(Criterion D). To qualify for the diagnosis, the binge eating and inappropriate compensa-\ntory behaviors must occur, on average, at least once per week for 3 months (Criterion C).\nAn “episode of binge eating” is defined as eating, in a discrete period of time, an\namount of food that is definitely larger than most individuals would eat in a similar period\nof time under similar circumstances (Criterion A1). The context in which the eating occurs\n346\nFeeding and Eating Disorders\nmay affect the clinician’s estimation of whether the intake is excessive. For example, a\nquantity of food that might be regarded as excessive for a typical meal might be consid-\nered normal during a celebration or holiday meal. A “discrete period of time” refers to a\nlimited period, usually less than 2 hours. A single episode of binge eating need not be re-\nstricted to one setting. For example, an individual may begin a binge in a restaurant and\nthen continue to eat on returning home. Continual snacking on small amounts of food\nthroughout the day would not be considered an eating binge.\nAn occurrence of excessive food consumption must be accompanied by a sense of lack\nof control (Criterion A2) to be considered an episode of binge eating. An indicator of loss\nof control is the inability to refrain from eating or to stop eating once started. Some indi-\nviduals describe a dissociative quality during, or following, the binge-eating episodes. The\nimpairment in control associated with binge eating may not be absolute; for example, an\nindividual may continue binge eating while the telephone is ringing but will cease if a\nroommate or spouse unexpectedly enters the room. Some individuals report that their\nbinge-eating episodes are no longer characterized by an acute feeling of loss of control but\nrather by a more generalized pattern of uncontrolled eating. If individuals report that they\nhave abandoned efforts to control their eating, loss of control should be considered as\npresent. Binge eating can also be planned in some instances.\nThe type of food consumed during binges varies both across individuals and for a\ngiven individual. Binge eating appears to be characterized more by an abnormality in the\namount of food consumed than by a craving for a specific nutrient. However, during binges,\nindividuals tend to eat foods they would otherwise avoid.\nIndividuals with bulimia nervosa are typically ashamed of their eating problems and\nattempt to conceal their symptoms. Binge eating usually occurs in secrecy or as inconspic-\nuously as possible. The binge eating often continues until the individual is uncomfortably,\nor even painfully, full. The most common antecedent of binge eating is negative affect.\nOther triggers include interpersonal stressors; dietary restraint; negative feelings related\nto body weight, body shape, and food; and boredom. Binge eating may minimize or mit-\nigate factors that precipitated the episode in the short-term, but negative self-evaluation\nand dysphoria often are the delayed consequences.\nAnother essential feature of bulimia nervosa is the recurrent use of inappropriate com-\npensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain, collectively referred to as purge behaviors or\npurging (Criterion B). Many individuals with bulimia nervosa employ several methods to\ncompensate for binge eating. Vomiting is the most common inappropriate compensatory\nbehavior. The immediate effects of vomiting include relief from physical discomfort and re-\nduction of fear of gaining weight. In some cases, vomiting becomes a goal in itself, and the\nindividual will binge eat in order to vomit or will vomit after eating a small amount of food.\nIndividuals with bulimia nervosa may use a variety of methods to induce vomiting, includ-\ning the use of fingers or instruments to stimulate the gag reflex. Individuals generally\nbecome adept at inducing vomiting and are eventually able to vomit at will. Rarely, indi-\nviduals consume syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting. Other purging behaviors include the\nmisuse of laxatives and diuretics. A number of other compensatory methods may also be\nused in rare cases. Individuals with bulimia nervosa may misuse enemas following epi-\nsodes of binge eating, but this is seldom the sole compensatory method employed. Individ-\nuals with this disorder may take thyroid hormone in an attempt to avoid weight gain.\nIndividuals with diabetes mellitus and bulimia nervosa may omit or reduce insulin doses in\norder to reduce the metabolism of food consumed during eating binges. Individuals with\nbulimia nervosa may fast for a day or more or exercise excessively in an attempt to prevent\nweight gain. Exercise may be considered excessive when it significantly interferes with im-\nportant activities, when it occurs at inappropriate times or in inappropriate settings, or\nwhen the individual continues to exercise despite injury or other medical complications.\nIndividuals with bulimia nervosa place an excessive emphasis on body shape or weight\nin their self-evaluation, and these factors are typically extremely important in determining\nBulimia Nervosa\n347\nself-esteem (Criterion D). Individuals with this disorder may closely resemble those with\nanorexia nervosa in their fear of gaining weight, in their desire to lose weight, and in the\nlevel of dissatisfaction with their bodies. However, a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa should\nnot be given when the disturbance occurs only during episodes of anorexia nervosa (Cri-\nterion E).\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

However, over longer-term follow-up, the\nsymptoms of many individuals appear to diminish with or without treatment, although\ntreatment clearly impacts outcome. Periods of remission longer than 1 year are associated\nwith better long-term outcome.\nSignificantly elevated risk for mortality (all-cause and suicide) has been reported for\nindividuals with bulimia nervosa. The CMR (crude mortality rate) for bulimia nervosa is\nnearly 2% per decade.\nDiagnostic cross-over from initial bulimia nervosa to anorexia nervosa occurs in a mi-\nnority of cases (10%–15%).

The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder. B. There is insidious onset and gradual progression of impairment in one or more cognitive domains (for major neurocognitive disorder, at least two domains must be impaired). C. Criteria are met for either probable or possible Alzheimer’s disease as follows: For major neurocognitive disorder: Probable Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed if either of the following is present; oth- erwise, possible Alzheimer’s disease should be diagnosed. 1. Evidence of a causative Alzheimer’s disease genetic mutation from family history or genetic testing. 2. All three of the following are present: a. Clear evidence of decline in memory and learning and at least one other cogni- tive domain (based on detailed history or serial neuropsychological testing). b. Steadily progressive, gradual decline in cognition, without extended plateaus. c. No evidence of mixed etiology (i.e., absence of other neurodegenerative or cerebrovascular disease, or another neurological, mental, or systemic disease or condition likely contributing to cognitive decline). For mild neurocognitive disorder: Probable Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed if there is evidence of a causative Alz- heimer’s disease genetic mutation from either genetic testing or family history. Possible Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed if there is no evidence of a causative Alz- heimer’s disease genetic mutation from either genetic testing or family history, and all three of the following are present: 1. Clear evidence of decline in memory and learning. 2. Steadily progressive, gradual decline in cognition, without extended plateaus. 3. No evidence of mixed etiology (i.e., absence of other neurodegenerative or cere- brovascular disease, or another neurological or systemic disease or condition likely contributing to cognitive decline). D. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease, another neurode- generative disease, the effects of a substance, or another mental, neurological, or sys- temic disorder. Coding note: For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, with behavioral disturbance, code first 331.0 (G30.9) Alzheimer’s disease, followed by 294.11 (F02.81) major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease. For probable neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, without behavioral disturbance, code first 331.0 (G30.9) Alzheimer’s disease, followed by 294.10 (F02.80) major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, without behavioral disturbance. For possible major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, code 331.9 (G31.9) possible major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease. (Note: Do not use the additional code for Alzheimer’s disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) 612 Neurocognitive Disorders For mild neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, code 331.83 (G31.84). (Note: Do not use the additional code for Alzheimer’s disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) Diagnostic Features Beyond the neurocognitive disorder (NCD) syndrome (Criterion A), the core features of ma- jor or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease include an insidious onset and gradual pro- gression of cognitive and behavioral symptoms (Criterion B). The typical presentation is amnestic (i.e., with impairment in memory and learning). Unusual nonamnestic presen- tations, particularly visuospatial and logopenic aphasic variants, also exist. At the mild NCD phase, Alzheimer’s disease manifests typically with impairment in memory and learn- ing, sometimes accompanied by deficits in executive function. At the major NCD phase, visuoconstructional/perceptual-motor ability and language will also be impaired, partic- ularly when the NCD is moderate to severe. Social cognition tends to be preserved until late in the course of the disease. A level of diagnostic certainty must be specified denoting Alzheimer’s disease as the “probable” or “possible” etiology (Criterion C). Probable Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed in both major and mild NCD if there is evidence of a causative Alzheimer’s disease gene, ei- ther from genetic testing or from an autosomal dominant family history coupled with au- topsy confirmation or a genetic test in an affected family member. For major NCD, a typical clinical picture, without extended plateaus or evidence of mixed etiology, can also be diagnosed as due to probable Alzheimer’s disease. For mild NCD, given the lesser de- gree of certainty that the deficits will progress, these features are only sufficient for a possible Alzheimer’s etiology. If the etiology appears mixed, mild NCD due to multiple eti- ologies should be diagnosed. In any case, for both mild and major NCD due to Alzhei- mer’s disease, the clinical features must not suggest another primary etiology for the NCD (Criterion D). Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis In specialty clinical settings, approximately 80% of individuals with major NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease have behavioral and psychological manifestations; these features are also frequent at the mild NCD stage of impairment. These symptoms are as or more dis- tressing than cognitive manifestations and are frequently the reason that health care is sought. At the mild NCD stage or the mildest level of major NCD, depression and/or ap- athy are often seen. With moderately severe major NCD, psychotic features, irritability, agitation, combativeness, and wandering are common. Late in the illness, gait distur- bance, dysphagia, incontinence, myoclonus, and seizures are observed. Prevalence The prevalence of overall dementia (major NCD) rises steeply with age. In high-income countries, it ranges from 5% to 10% in the seventh decade to at least 25% thereafter. U.S. census data estimates suggest that approximately 7% of individuals diagnosed with Alz- heimer’s disease are between ages 65 and 74 years, 53% are between ages 75 and 84 years, and 40% are 85 years and older. The percentage of dementias attributable to Alzheimer’s disease ranges from about 60% to over 90%, depending on the setting and diagnostic cri- teria. Mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease is likely to represent a substantial fraction of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well. Development and Course Major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease progresses gradually, sometimes with brief plateaus, through severe dementia to death. The mean duration of survival after di- Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer’s Disease 613 agnosis is approximately 10 years, reflecting the advanced age of the majority of individ- uals rather than the course of the disease; some individuals can live with the disease for as long as 20 years. Late-stage individuals are eventually mute and bedbound. Death most commonly results from aspiration in those who survive through the full course. In mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease, impairments increase over time, and functional status gradually declines until symptoms reach the threshold for the diagnosis of major NCD. The onset of symptoms is usually in the eighth and ninth decades; early-onset forms seen in the fifth and sixth decades are often related to known causative mutations. Symp- toms and pathology do not differ markedly at different onset ages. However, younger in- dividuals are more likely to survive the full course of the disease, while older individuals are more likely to have numerous medical comorbidities that affect the course and man- agement of the illness. Diagnostic complexity is higher in older adults because of the in- creased likelihood of comorbid medical illness and mixed pathology. Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Traumatic brain injury increases risk for major or mild NCD due to Alz- heimer’s disease. Genetic and physiological. Age is the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. The genetic susceptibility polymorphism apolipoprotein E4 increases risk and decreases age at onset, particularly in homozygous individuals. There are also extremely rare causative Alzheimer’s disease genes. Individuals with Down’s syndrome (trisomy 21) develop Alz- heimer’s disease if they survive to midlife. Multiple vascular risk factors influence risk for Alzheimer’s disease and may act by increasing cerebrovascular pathology or also through direct effects on Alzheimer pathology. Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Detection of an NCD may be more difficult in cultural and socioeconomic settings where memory loss is considered normal in old age, where older adults face fewer cognitive de- mands in everyday life, or where very low educational levels pose greater challenges to objective cognitive assessment. Diagnostic Markers Cortical atrophy, amyloid-predominant neuritic plaques, and tau-predominant neurofibril- lary tangles are hallmarks of the pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and may be confirmed via postmortem histopathological examination. For early-onset cases with auto- somal dominant inheritance, a mutation in one of the known causative Alzheimer’s disease genes—amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), or presenilin 2 (PSEN2)— may be involved, and genetic testing for such mutations is commercially available, at least for PSEN1. Apolipoprotein E4 cannot serve as a diagnostic marker because it is only a risk factor and neither necessary nor sufficient for disease occurrence. Since amyloid beta-42 deposition in the brain occurs early in the pathophysiological cascade, amyloid-based diagnostic tests such as amyloid imaging on brain positron emis- sion tomography (PET) scans and reduced levels of amyloid beta-42 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may have diagnostic value. Signs of neuronal injury, such as hippocampal and temporoparietal cortical atrophy on a magnetic resonance image scan, temporoparietal hypometabolism on a fluorodeoxyglucose PET scan, and evidence for elevated total tau and phospho-tau levels in CSF, provide evidence of neuronal damage but are less specific for Alzheimer’s disease. At present, these biomarkers are not fully validated, and many are available only in tertiary care settings. However, some of them, along with novel bio- markers, will likely move into wider clinical practice in the coming years. 614 Neurocognitive Disorders Functional Consequences of Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer’s Disease The prominence of memory loss can cause significant difficulties relatively early in the course. Social cognition (and thus social functioning) and procedural memory (e.g., danc- ing, playing musical instruments) may be relatively preserved for extended periods. Differential Diagnosis Other neurocognitive disorders. Major and mild NCDs due to other neurodegenera- tive processes (e.g., Lewy body disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration) share the in- sidious onset and gradual decline caused by Alzheimer’s disease but have distinctive core features of their own. In major or mild vascular NCD, there is typically history of stroke temporally related to the onset of cognitive impairment, and infarcts or white matter hy- perintensities are judged sufficient to account for the clinical picture. However, particu- larly when there is no clear history of stepwise decline, major or mild vascular NCD can share many clinical features with Alzheimer’s disease. Other concurrent, active neurological or systemic illness. Other neurological or sys- temic illness should be considered if there is an appropriate temporal relationship and severity to account for the clinical picture. At the mild NCD level, it may be difficult to dis- tinguish an Alzheimer’s disease etiology from that of another medical condition (e.g., thy- roid disorders, vitamin B12 deficiency). Major depressive disorder. Particularly at the mild NCD level, the differential diagnosis also includes major depression. The presence of depression may be associated with re- duced daily functioning and poor concentration that may resemble an NCD, but improve- ment with treatment of depression may be useful in making the distinction. Comorbidity Most individuals with Alzheimer’s disease are elderly and have multiple medical conditions that can complicate diagnosis and influence the clinical course. Major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease commonly co-occurs with cerebrovascular disease, which contributes to the clinical picture. When a comorbid condition contributes to the NCD in an individual with Alzheimer’s disease, then NCD due to multiple etiologies should be diagnosed.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each case should describe overlapping symptoms and require choosing between two similar disorders, with a contrastive justification.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Differential Diagnosis]\nMajor or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies.\nThis distinction is based sub-\nstantially on the timing and sequence of motor and cognitive symptoms. For NCD to be at-\ntributed to Parkinson’s disease, the motor and other symptoms of Parkinson’s disease must\nbe present well before (by convention, at least 1 year prior) cognitive decline has reached\nthe level of major NCD, whereas in major or mild NCD with Lewy bodies, cognitive symp-\ntoms begin shortly before, or concurrent with, motor symptoms. For mild NCD, the timing\nis harder to establish because the diagnosis itself is less clear and the two disorders exist on\na continuum. Unless Parkinson’s disease has been established for some time prior to the\nonset of cognitive decline, or typical features of major or mild NCD with Lewy bodies are\npresent, it is preferable to diagnose unspecified mild NCD.\nMajor or mild neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease.\nThe motor features\nare the key to distinguishing major or mild NCD due to Parkinson’s disease from major or\nmild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease. However, the two disorders can co-occur.\nMajor or mild vascular neurocognitive disorder.\nMajor or mild vascular NCD may pre-\nsent with parkinsonian features such as psychomotor slowing that may occur as a conse-\nquence of subcortical small vessel disease. However, the parkinsonian features typically\nare not sufficient for a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, and the course of the NCD usually\nhas a clear association with cerebrovascular changes.\nNeurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition (e.g., neurodegenerative\ndisorders).\nWhen a diagnosis of major or mild NCD due to Parkinson’s disease is being\nconsidered, the distinction must also be made from other brain disorders, such as progres-\nsive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, multiple system atrophy, tumors, and\nhydrocephalus.\nNeuroleptic-induced parkinsonism.\nNeuroleptic-induced parkinsonism can occur in\nindividuals with other NCDs, particularly when dopamine-blocking drugs are prescribed\nfor the behavioral manifestations of such disorders\nOther medical conditions.\nDelirium and NCDs due to side effects of dopamine-blocking\ndrugs and other medical conditions (e.g., sedation or impaired cognition, severe hypothy-\nroidism, B12 deficiency) must also be ruled out.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each should describe a clinical presentation that could plausibly fit different specifier categories, and require reasoning to select the correct one.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Specifiers]\nThe severity specifiers (see Table 2) may be used to describe succinctly the current symp-\ntomatology (which might fall below level 1), with the recognition that severity may vary by\ncontext and fluctuate over time. Severity of social communication difficulties and re-\nstricted, repetitive behaviors should be separately rated. The descriptive severity categories\nshould not be used to determine eligibility for and provision of services; these can only be\ndeveloped at an individual level and through discussion of personal priorities and targets.\nRegarding the specifier “with or without accompanying intellectual impairment,” un-\nderstanding the (often uneven) intellectual profile of a child or adult with autism spectrum\ndisorder is necessary for interpreting diagnostic features. Separate estimates of verbal and\nnonverbal skill are necessary (e.g., using untimed nonverbal tests to assess potential\nstrengths in individuals with limited language).\n52\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nTABLE 2 Severity levels for autism spectrum disorder\nSeverity level\nSocial communication\nRestricted, repetitive behaviors\nLevel 3\n“Requiring very substantial support”\nSevere deficits in verbal and nonverbal social com-\nmunication skills cause severe impairments in func-\ntioning, very limited initiation of social\ninteractions, and minimal response to social over-\ntures from others. For example, a person with few\nwords of intelligible speech who rarely initiates\ninteraction and, when he or she does, makes\nunusual approaches to meet needs only and\nresponds to only very direct social approaches.\nInflexibility of behavior, extreme difficulty coping\nwith change, or other restricted/repetitive behav-\niors markedly interfere with functioning in all\nspheres. Great distress/difficulty changing focus\nor action.\nLevel 2\n“Requiring substantial support”\nMarked deficits in verbal and nonverbal social com-\nmunication skills; social impairments apparent\neven with supports in place; limited initiation of\nsocial interactions; and reduced or abnormal\nresponses to social overtures from others. For\nexample, a person who speaks simple sentences,\nwhose interaction is limited to narrow special inter-\nests, and who has markedly odd nonverbal com-\nmunication.\nInflexibility of behavior, difficulty coping with\nchange, or other restricted/repetitive behaviors\nappear frequently enough to be obvious to the\ncasual observer and interfere with functioning\nin a variety of contexts. Distress and/or difficulty\nchanging focus or action.\nLevel 1\n“Requiring support”\nWithout supports in place, deficits in social communi-\ncation cause noticeable impairments.\nDifficulty initiating social interactions, and clear\nexamples of atypical or unsuccessful responses to\nsocial overtures of others.

For example,\na person who is able to speak in full sentences and\nengages in communication but whose to-and-fro con-\nversation with others fails, and whose attempts to\nmake friends are odd and typically unsuccessful.\nInflexibility of behavior causes significant interfer-\nence with functioning in one or more contexts. Dif-\nficulty switching between activities. Problems of\norganization and planning hamper independence.\nAutism Spectrum Disorder\n53\nTo use the specifier “with or without accompanying language impairment,” the cur-\nrent level of verbal functioning should be assessed and described. Examples of the specific\ndescriptions for “with accompanying language impairment” might include no intelligible\nspeech (nonverbal), single words only, or phrase speech. Language level in individuals\n“without accompanying language impairment” might be further described by speaks in\nfull sentences or has fluent speech. Since receptive language may lag behind expressive\nlanguage development in autism spectrum disorder, receptive and expressive language\nskills should be considered separately.\nThe specifier “associated with a known medical or genetic condition or environmental fac-\ntor” should be used when the individual has a known genetic disorder (e.g., Rett syndrome,\nFragile X syndrome, Down syndrome), a medical disorder (e.g. epilepsy), or a history of envi-\nronmental exposure (e.g., valproate, fetal alcohol syndrome, very low birth weight).\nAdditional neurodevelopmental, mental or behavioral conditions should also be noted\n(e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; developmental coordination disorder; dis-\nruptive behavior, impulse-control, or conduct disorders; anxiety, depressive, or bipolar\ndisorders; tics or Tourette’s disorder; self-injury; feeding, elimination, or sleep disorders).\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each must present overlapping symptoms, two possible diagnoses, and justify why one is preferred.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Features]\nThe essential features of autism spectrum disorder are persistent impairment in reciprocal\nsocial communication and social interaction (Criterion A), and restricted, repetitive pat-\nterns of behavior, interests, or activities (Criterion B). These symptoms are present from\nearly childhood and limit or impair everyday functioning (Criteria C and D). The stage at\nwhich functional impairment becomes obvious will vary according to characteristics of\nthe individual and his or her environment. Core diagnostic features are evident in the\ndevelopmental period, but intervention, compensation, and current supports may mask\ndifficulties in at least some contexts. Manifestations of the disorder also vary greatly de-\npending on the severity of the autistic condition, developmental level, and chronological age;\nhence, the term spectrum. Autism spectrum disorder encompasses disorders previously re-\nferred to as early infantile autism, childhood autism, Kanner’s autism, high-functioning\nautism, atypical autism, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, child-\nhood disintegrative disorder, and Asperger’s disorder.\nThe impairments in communication and social interaction specified in Criterion A are\npervasive and sustained. Diagnoses are most valid and reliable when based on multiple\nsources of information, including clinician’s observations, caregiver history, and, when\npossible, self-report. Verbal and nonverbal deficits in social communication have varying\nmanifestations, depending on the individual’s age, intellectual level, and language ability,\nas well as other factors such as treatment history and current support. Many individuals\nhave language deficits, ranging from complete lack of speech through language delays,\npoor comprehension of speech, echoed speech, or stilted and overly literal language. Even\nwhen formal language skills (e.g., vocabulary, grammar) are intact, the use of language for\nreciprocal social communication is impaired in autism spectrum disorder.\nDeficits in social-emotional reciprocity (i.e., the ability to engage with others and share\nthoughts and feelings) are clearly evident in young children with the disorder, who may\nshow little or no initiation of social interaction and no sharing of emotions, along with re-\nduced or absent imitation of others’ behavior. What language exists is often one-sided,\nlacking in social reciprocity, and used to request or label rather than to comment, share\nfeelings, or converse. In adults without intellectual disabilities or language delays, deficits\nin social-emotional reciprocity may be most apparent in difficulties processing and re-\nsponding to complex social cues (e.g., when and how to join a conversation, what not to\nsay). Adults who have developed compensation strategies for some social challenges still\nstruggle in novel or unsupported situations and suffer from the effort and anxiety of con-\nsciously calculating what is socially intuitive for most individuals.\n54\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nDeficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction are mani-\nfested by absent, reduced, or atypical use of eye contact (relative to cultural norms), ges-\ntures, facial expressions, body orientation, or speech intonation. An early feature of autism\nspectrum disorder is impaired joint attention as manifested by a lack of pointing, showing,\nor bringing objects to share interest with others, or failure to follow someone’s pointing or\neye gaze. Individuals may learn a few functional gestures, but their repertoire is smaller\nthan that of others, and they often fail to use expressive gestures spontaneously in com-\nmunication. Among adults with fluent language, the difficulty in coordinating nonverbal\ncommunication with speech may give the impression of odd, wooden, or exaggerated\n“body language” during interactions. Impairment may be relatively subtle within indi-\nvidual modes (e.g., someone may have relatively good eye contact when speaking) but\nnoticeable in poor integration of eye contact, gesture, body posture, prosody, and facial ex-\npression for social communication.\nDeficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships should be\njudged against norms for age, gender, and culture. There may be absent, reduced, or atyp-\nical social interest, manifested by rejection of others, passivity, or inappropriate ap-\nproaches that seem aggressive or disruptive. These difficulties are particularly evident in\nyoung children, in whom there is often a lack of shared social play and imagination (e.g.,\nage-appropriate flexible pretend play) and, later, insistence on playing by very fixed rules.\nOlder individuals may struggle to understand what behavior is considered appropriate in\none situation but not another (e.g., casual behavior during a job interview), or the different\nways that language may be used to communicate (e.g., irony, white lies). There may be an\napparent preference for solitary activities or for interacting with much younger or older\npeople. Frequently, there is a desire to establish friendships without a complete or realistic\nidea of what friendship entails (e.g., one-sided friendships or friendships based solely on\nshared special interests). Relationships with siblings, co-workers, and caregivers are also\nimportant to consider (in terms of reciprocity).\nAutism spectrum disorder is also defined by restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior,\ninterests, or activities (as specified in Criterion B), which show a range of manifestations\naccording to age and ability, intervention, and current supports. Stereotyped or repetitive\nbehaviors include simple motor stereotypies (e.g., hand flapping, finger flicking), repeti-\ntive use of objects (e.g., spinning coins, lining up toys), and repetitive speech (e.g., echola-\nlia, the delayed or immediate parroting of heard words; use of “you” when referring to\nself; stereotyped use of words, phrases, or prosodic patterns). Excessive adherence to rou-\ntines and restricted patterns of behavior may be manifest in resistance to change (e.g., dis-\ntress at apparently small changes, such as in packaging of a favorite food; insistence on\nadherence to rules; rigidity of thinking) or ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal be-\nhavior (e.g., repetitive questioning, pacing a perimeter). Highly restricted, fixated interests\nin autism spectrum disorder tend to be abnormal in intensity or focus (e.g., a toddler\nstrongly attached to a pan; a child preoccupied with vacuum cleaners; an adult spending\nhours writing out timetables). Some fascinations and routines may relate to apparent hy-\nper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input, manifested through extreme responses to specific\nsounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, fascination with lights or\nspinning objects, and sometimes apparent indifference to pain, heat, or cold. Extreme re-\naction to or rituals involving taste, smell, texture, or appearance of food or excessive food\nrestrictions are common and may be a presenting feature of autism spectrum disorder.\nMany adults with autism spectrum disorder without intellectual or language disabili-\nties learn to suppress repetitive behavior in public. Special interests may be a source of\npleasure and motivation and provide avenues for education and employment later in life.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

{"uuid": "8e5564be-322b-4fa7-86cf-7e6cef54425f", "disorder": "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "section": "development_course", "task": "3C", "qa_count": 2, "prompt": "From the Development and Course section, generate 2 ambiguous cases. Each should present a timeline of symptoms that could fit two disorders, and require contrastive reasoning based on onset, progression, or duration.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Development Course]\nThe age and pattern of onset also should be noted for autism spectrum disorder. Symptoms\nare typically recognized during the second year of life (12–24 months of age) but may be seen\nearlier than 12 months if developmental delays are severe, or noted later than 24 months if\nsymptoms are more subtle. The pattern of onset description might include information\nabout early developmental delays or any losses of social or language skills. In cases where\nskills have been lost, parents or caregivers may give a history of a gradual or relatively\nrapid deterioration in social behaviors or language skills. Typically, this would occur be-\ntween 12 and 24 months of age and is distinguished from the rare instances of developmen-\ntal regression occurring after at least 2 years of normal development (previously described\nas childhood disintegrative disorder).\nThe behavioral features of autism spectrum disorder first become evident in early\nchildhood, with some cases presenting a lack of interest in social interaction in the first\nyear of life. Some children with autism spectrum disorder experience developmental pla-\nteaus or regression, with a gradual or relatively rapid deterioration in social behaviors or\nuse of language, often during the first 2 years of life. Such losses are rare in other disor-\nders and may be a useful “red flag” for autism spectrum disorder. Much more unusual\nand warranting more extensive medical investigation are losses of skills beyond social\ncommunication (e.g., loss of self-care, toileting, motor skills) or those occurring after the\n56\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nsecond birthday (see also Rett syndrome in the section “Differential Diagnosis” for this\ndisorder).\nFirst symptoms of autism spectrum disorder frequently involve delayed language de-\nvelopment, often accompanied by lack of social interest or unusual social interactions (e.g.,\npulling individuals by the hand without any attempt to look at them), odd play patterns\n(e.g., carrying toys around but never playing with them), and unusual communication\npatterns (e.g., knowing the alphabet but not responding to own name). Deafness may be\nsuspected but is typically ruled out. During the second year, odd and repetitive behaviors\nand the absence of typical play become more apparent. Since many typically developing\nyoung children have strong preferences and enjoy repetition (e.g., eating the same foods,\nwatching the same video multiple times), distinguishing restricted and repetitive behav-\niors that are diagnostic of autism spectrum disorder can be difficult in preschoolers. The\nclinical distinction is based on the type, frequency, and intensity of the behavior (e.g., a\nchild who daily lines up objects for hours and is very distressed if any item is moved).\nAutism spectrum disorder is not a degenerative disorder, and it is typical for learning\nand compensation to continue throughout life. Symptoms are often most marked in early\nchildhood and early school years, with developmental gains typical in later childhood in\nat least some areas (e.g., increased interest in social interaction). A small proportion of in-\ndividuals deteriorate behaviorally during adolescence, whereas most others improve.\nOnly a minority of individuals with autism spectrum disorder live and work indepen-\ndently in adulthood; those who do tend to have superior language and intellectual abilities\nand are able to find a niche that matches their special interests and skills. In general, indi-\nviduals with lower levels of impairment may be better able to function independently.\nHowever, even these individuals may remain socially naive and vulnerable, have difficul-\nties organizing practical demands without aid, and are prone to anxiety and depression.\nMany adults report using compensation strategies and coping mechanisms to mask their\ndifficulties in public but suffer from the stress and effort of maintaining a socially accept-\nable facade. Scarcely anything is known about old age in autism spectrum disorder.\nSome individuals come for first diagnosis in adulthood, perhaps prompted by the diagno-\nsis of autism in a child in the family or a breakdown of relations at work or home. Obtaining de-\ntailed developmental history in such cases may be difficult, and it is important to consider self-\nreported difficulties. Where clinical observation suggests criteria are currently met, autism\nspectrum disorder may be diagnosed, provided there is no evidence of good social and com-\nmunication skills in childhood. For example, the report (by parents or another relative) that the\nindividual had ordinary and sustained reciprocal friendships and good nonverbal communi-\ncation skills throughout childhood would rule out a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder;\nhowever, the absence of developmental information in itself should not do so.\nManifestations of the social and communication impairments and restricted/repeti-\ntive behaviors that define autism spectrum disorder are clear in the developmental period.\nIn later life, intervention or compensation, as well as current supports, may mask these dif-\nficulties in at least some contexts. However, symptoms remain sufficient to cause current\nimpairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each case should describe overlapping symptoms and require choosing between two similar disorders, with a contrastive justification.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Differential Diagnosis]\nRett syndrome.\nDisruption of social interaction may be observed during the regressive\nphase of Rett syndrome (typically between 1–4 years of age); thus, a substantial proportion\nof affected young girls may have a presentation that meets diagnostic criteria for autism\nspectrum disorder. However, after this period, most individuals with Rett syndrome im-\nprove their social communication skills, and autistic features are no longer a major area of\nconcern. Consequently, autism spectrum disorder should be considered only when all di-\nagnostic criteria are met.\nSelective mutism.\nIn selective mutism, early development is not typically disturbed.\nThe affected child usually exhibits appropriate communication skills in certain contexts\nand settings. Even in settings where the child is mute, social reciprocity is not impaired,\nnor are restricted or repetitive patterns of behavior present.\n58\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nLanguage disorders and social (pragmatic) communication disorder.\nIn some forms\nof language disorder, there may be problems of communication and some secondary so-\ncial difficulties. However, specific language disorder is not usually associated with abnor-\nmal nonverbal communication, nor with the presence of restricted, repetitive patterns of\nbehavior, interests, or activities.\nWhen an individual shows impairment in social communication and social interactions\nbut does not show restricted and repetitive behavior or interests, criteria for social (prag-\nmatic) communication disorder, instead of autism spectrum disorder, may be met. The di-\nagnosis of autism spectrum disorder supersedes that of social (pragmatic) communication\ndisorder whenever the criteria for autism spectrum disorder are met, and care should be\ntaken to enquire carefully regarding past or current restricted/repetitive behavior.\nIntellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) without autism spectrum\ndisorder.\nIntellectual disability without autism spectrum disorder may be difficult to\ndifferentiate from autism spectrum disorder in very young children. Individuals with in-\ntellectual disability who have not developed language or symbolic skills also present a\nchallenge for differential diagnosis, since repetitive behavior often occurs in such individ-\nuals as well. A diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in an individual with intellectual\ndisability is appropriate when social communication and interaction are significantly im-\npaired relative to the developmental level of the individual’s nonverbal skills (e.g., fine\nmotor skills, nonverbal problem solving). In contrast, intellectual disability is the appropri-\nate diagnosis when there is no apparent discrepancy between the level of social-commu-\nnicative skills and other intellectual skills.\nStereotypic movement disorder.\nMotor stereotypies are among the diagnostic charac-\nteristics of autism spectrum disorder, so an additional diagnosis of stereotypic movement\ndisorder is not given when such repetitive behaviors are better explained by the presence\nof autism spectrum disorder. However, when stereotypies cause self-injury and become a\nfocus of treatment, both diagnoses may be appropriate.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nAbnormalities of attention (overly focused or\neasily distracted) are common in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, as is hy-\nperactivity. A diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) should be\nconsidered when attentional difficulties or hyperactivity exceeds that typically seen in in-\ndividuals of comparable mental age.\nSchizophrenia.\nSchizophrenia with childhood onset usually develops after a period of\nnormal, or near normal, development. A prodromal state has been described in which so-\ncial impairment and atypical interests and beliefs occur, which could be confused with the\nsocial deficits seen in autism spectrum disorder. Hallucinations and delusions, which are\ndefining features of schizophrenia, are not features of autism spectrum disorder. How-\never, clinicians must take into account the potential for individuals with autism spectrum\ndisorder to be concrete in their interpretation of questions regarding the key features of\nschizophrenia (e.g., “Do you hear voices when no one is there?” ”Yes [on the radio]”).\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Many in-\ndividuals with autism spectrum disorder have psychiatric symptoms that do not form part of\nthe diagnostic criteria for the disorder (about 70% of individuals with autism spectrum dis-\norder may have one comorbid mental disorder, and 40% may have two or more comorbid\nmental disorders). When criteria for both ADHD and autism spectrum disorder are met, both\ndiagnoses should be given. This same principle applies to concurrent diagnoses of autism\nspectrum disorder and developmental coordination disorder, anxiety disorders, depressive\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder\n59\ndisorders, and other comorbid diagnoses. Among individuals who are nonverbal or have\nlanguage deficits, observable signs such as changes in sleep or eating and increases in chal-\nlenging behavior should trigger an evaluation for anxiety or depression. Specific learning dif-\nficulties (literacy and numeracy) are common, as is developmental coordination disorder.\nMedical conditions commonly associated with autism spectrum disorder should be noted\nunder the “associated with a known medical/genetic or environmental/acquired condition”\nspecifier.

Each must present overlapping symptoms, two possible diagnoses, and justify why one is preferred.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Features]\nThe essential feature of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a persistent\npattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or\ndevelopment. Inattention manifests behaviorally in ADHD as wandering off task, lacking\npersistence, having difficulty sustaining focus, and being disorganized and is not due to\ndefiance or lack of comprehension. Hyperactivity refers to excessive motor activity (such as\na child running about) when it is not appropriate, or excessive fidgeting, tapping, or talk-\nativeness. In adults, hyperactivity may manifest as extreme restlessness or wearing others\nout with their activity. Impulsivity refers to hasty actions that occur in the moment without\nforethought and that have high potential for harm to the individual (e.g., darting into the\nstreet without looking). Impulsivity may reflect a desire for immediate rewards or an in-\nability to delay gratification. Impulsive behaviors may manifest as social intrusiveness\n(e.g., interrupting others excessively) and/or as making important decisions without con-\nsideration of long-term consequences (e.g., taking a job without adequate information).\nADHD begins in childhood. The requirement that several symptoms be present before\nage 12 years conveys the importance of a substantial clinical presentation during child-\nhood. At the same time, an earlier age at onset is not specified because of difficulties in es-\ntablishing precise childhood onset retrospectively. Adult recall of childhood symptoms\ntends to be unreliable, and it is beneficial to obtain ancillary information.\nManifestations of the disorder must be present in more than one setting (e.g., home and\nschool, work). Confirmation of substantial symptoms across settings typically cannot be\ndone accurately without consulting informants who have seen the individual in those set-\ntings. Typically, symptoms vary depending on context within a given setting. Signs of the\ndisorder may be minimal or absent when the individual is receiving frequent rewards for\nappropriate behavior, is under close supervision, is in a novel setting, is engaged in espe-\ncially interesting activities, has consistent external stimulation (e.g., via electronic screens),\nor is interacting in one-on-one situations (e.g., the clinician's office).\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

The disorder is relatively stable through early ad-\nolescence, but some individuals have a worsened course with development of antisocial\nbehaviors.

A substantial proportion of children with ADHD\nremain relatively impaired into adulthood.\nIn preschool, the main manifestation is hyperactivity. Inattention becomes more prom-\ninent during elementary school. During adolescence, signs of hyperactivity (e.g., running\nand climbing) are less common and may be confined to fidgetiness or an inner feeling of\njitteriness, restlessness, or impatience.

Children\nwith ADHD are significantly more likely than their peers without ADHD to develop con-\nduct disorder in adolescence and antisocial personality disorder in adulthood, conse-\nquently increasing the likelihood for substance use disorders and incarceration. The risk of\nsubsequent substance use disorders is elevated, especially when conduct disorder or an-\ntisocial personality disorder develops. Individuals with ADHD are more likely than peers\nto be injured. Traffic accidents and violations are more frequent in drivers with ADHD.\nThere may be an elevated likelihood of obesity among individuals with ADHD.\nInadequate or variable self-application to tasks that require sustained effort is often in-\nterpreted by others as laziness, irresponsibility, or failure to cooperate. Family relation-\nships may be characterized by discord and negative interactions. Peer relationships are\noften disrupted by peer rejection, neglect, or teasing of the individual with ADHD. On av-\nerage, individuals with ADHD obtain less schooling, have poorer vocational achievement,\nand have reduced intellectual scores than their peers, although there is great variability. In\nits severe form, the disorder is markedly impairing, affecting social, familial, and scholas-\ntic/occupational adjustment.\nAcademic deficits, school-related problems, and peer neglect tend to be most associ-\nated with elevated symptoms of inattention, whereas peer rejection and, to a lesser extent,\naccidental injury are most salient with marked symptoms of hyperactivity or impulsivity.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each case should describe overlapping symptoms and require choosing between two similar disorders, with a contrastive justification.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Differential Diagnosis]\nOppositional defiant disorder.\nIndividuals with oppositional defiant disorder may re-\nsist work or school tasks that require self-application because they resist conforming to\nothers' demands. Their behavior is characterized by negativity, hostility, and defiance.\nThese symptoms must be differentiated from aversion to school or mentally demanding\ntasks due to difficulty in sustaining mental effort, forgetting instructions, and impulsivity\nin individuals with ADHD. Complicating the differential diagnosis is the fact that some\nindividuals with ADHD may develop secondary oppositional attitudes toward such tasks\nand devalue their importance.\nIntermittent explosive disorder.\nADHD and intermittent explosive disorder share high\nlevels of impulsive behavior. However, individuals with intermittent explosive disorder\nshow serious aggression toward others, which is not characteristic of ADHD, and they do\nnot experience problems with sustaining attention as seen in ADHD. In addition, intermit-\ntent explosive disorder is rare in childhood. Intermittent explosive disorder may be diag-\nnosed in the presence of ADHD.\nOther neurodevelopmental disorders.\nThe increased motoric activity that may occur in\nADHD must be distinguished from the repetitive motor behavior that characterizes stereo-\ntypic movement disorder and some cases of autism spectrum disorder. In stereotypic\nmovement disorder, the motoric behavior is generally fixed and repetitive (e.g., body rock-\ning, self-biting), whereas the fidgetiness and restlessness in ADHD are typically general-\nized and not characterized by repetitive stereotypic movements. In Tourette’s disorder,\n64\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nfrequent multiple tics can be mistaken for the generalized fidgetiness of ADHD. Prolonged\nobservation may be needed to differentiate fidgetiness from bouts of multiple tics.\nSpecific learning disorder.\nChildren with specific learning disorder may appear inat-\ntentive because of frustration, lack of interest, or limited ability. However, inattention in\nindividuals with a specific learning disorder who do not have ADHD is not impairing out-\nside of academic work.\nIntellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).\nSymptoms of ADHD are\ncommon among children placed in academic settings that are inappropriate to their intel-\nlectual ability. In such cases, the symptoms are not evident during non-academic tasks. A\ndiagnosis of ADHD in intellectual disability requires that inattention or hyperactivity be\nexcessive for mental age.\nAutism spectrum disorder.\nIndividuals with ADHD and those with autism spectrum\ndisorder exhibit inattention, social dysfunction, and difficult-to-manage behavior. The so-\ncial dysfunction and peer rejection seen in individuals with ADHD must be distinguished\nfrom the social disengagement, isolation, and indifference to facial and tonal communica-\ntion cues seen in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Children with autism spec-\ntrum disorder may display tantrums because of an inability to tolerate a change from their\nexpected course of events. In contrast, children with ADHD may misbehave or have a tan-\ntrum during a major transition because of impulsivity or poor self-control.\nReactive attachment disorder.\nChildren with reactive attachment disorder may show\nsocial disinhibition, but not the full ADHD symptom cluster, and display other features\nsuch as a lack of enduring relationships that are not characteristic of ADHD.\nAnxiety disorders.\nADHD shares symptoms of inattention with anxiety disorders. Indi-\nviduals with ADHD are inattentive because of their attraction to external stimuli, new\nactivities, or preoccupation with enjoyable activities. This is distinguished from the inat-\ntention due to worry and rumination seen in anxiety disorders. Restlessness might be seen\nin anxiety disorders. However, in ADHD, the symptom is not associated with worry and\nrumination.\nDepressive disorders.\nIndividuals with depressive disorders may present with inabil-\nity to concentrate. However, poor concentration in mood disorders becomes prominent\nonly during a depressive episode.\nBipolar disorder.\nIndividuals with bipolar disorder may have increased activity, poor\nconcentration, and increased impulsivity, but these features are episodic, occurring sev-\neral days at a time. In bipolar disorder, increased impulsivity or inattention is accompa-\nnied by elevated mood, grandiosity, and other specific bipolar features. Children with\nADHD may show significant changes in mood within the same day; such lability is dis-\ntinct from a manic episode, which must last 4 or more days to be a clinical indicator of bi-\npolar disorder, even in children. Bipolar disorder is rare in preadolescents, even when\nsevere irritability and anger are prominent, whereas ADHD is common among children\nand adolescents who display excessive anger and irritability.\nDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder.\nDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder is\ncharacterized by pervasive irritability, and intolerance of frustration, but impulsiveness\nand disorganized attention are not essential features. However, most children and adoles-\ncents with the disorder have symptoms that also meet criteria for ADHD, which is diag-\nnosed separately.\nSubstance use disorders.\nDifferentiating ADHD from substance use disorders may be\nproblematic if the first presentation of ADHD symptoms follows the onset of abuse or fre-\nquent use. Clear evidence of ADHD before substance misuse from informants or previous\nrecords may be essential for differential diagnosis.\nOther Specified Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder\n65\nPersonality disorders.\nIn adolescents and adults, it may be difficult to distinguish ADHD\nfrom borderline, narcissistic, and other personality disorders. All these disorders tend to\nshare the features of disorganization, social intrusiveness, emotional dysregulation, and\ncognitive dysregulation. However, ADHD is not characterized by fear of abandonment,\nself-injury, extreme ambivalence, or other features of personality disorder. It may take\nextended clinical observation, informant interview, or detailed history to distinguish im-\npulsive, socially intrusive, or inappropriate behavior from narcissistic, aggressive, or dom-\nineering behavior to make this differential diagnosis.\nPsychotic disorders.\nADHD is not diagnosed if the symptoms of inattention and hyperac-\ntivity occur exclusively during the course of a psychotic disorder.\nMedication-induced symptoms of ADHD.\nSymptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or\nimpulsivity attributable to the use of medication (e.g., bronchodilators, isoniazid, neuro-\nleptics [resulting in akathisia], thyroid replacement medication) are diagnosed as other\nspecified or unspecified other (or unknown) substance–related disorders.\nNeurocognitive disorders.\nEarly major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) and/or\nmild neurocognitive disorder are not known to be associated with ADHD but may present\nwith similar clinical features. These conditions are distinguished from ADHD by their late\nonset.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each must present overlapping symptoms, two possible diagnoses, and justify why one is preferred.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Features]\nThe characteristic symptoms of OCD are the presence of obsessions and compulsions (Cri-\nterion A). Obsessions are repetitive and persistent thoughts (e.g., of contamination), images\n(e.g., of violent or horrific scenes), or urges (e.g., to stab someone). Importantly, obsessions\nare not pleasurable or experienced as voluntary: they are intrusive and unwanted and\ncause marked distress or anxiety in most individuals. The individual attempts to ignore or\nsuppress these obsessions (e.g., avoiding triggers or using thought suppression) or to neu-\ntralize them with another thought or action (e.g., performing a compulsion). Compulsions\n(or rituals) are repetitive behaviors (e.g., washing, checking) or mental acts (e.g., counting,\nrepeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an\nobsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly. Most individuals with OCD\nhave both obsessions and compulsions. Compulsions are typically performed in response\nto an obsession (e.g., thoughts of contamination leading to washing rituals or that some-\nthing is incorrect leading to repeating rituals until it feels “just right”). The aim is to reduce\nthe distress triggered by obsessions or to prevent a feared event (e.g., becoming ill). How-\never, these compulsions either are not connected in a realistic way to the feared event (e.g.,\narranging items symmetrically to prevent harm to a loved one) or are clearly excessive\n(e.g., showering for hours each day). Compulsions are not done for pleasure, although some\nindividuals experience relief from anxiety or distress.\nCriterion B emphasizes that obsessions and compulsions must be time-consuming (e.g.,\nmore than 1 hour per day) or cause clinically significant distress or impairment to warrant\na diagnosis of OCD. This criterion helps to distinguish the disorder from the occasional in-\ntrusive thoughts or repetitive behaviors that are common in the general population (e.g.,\ndouble-checking that a door is locked). The frequency and severity of obsessions and com-\npulsions vary across individuals with OCD (e.g., some have mild to moderate symptoms,\nspending 1–3 hours per day obsessing or doing compulsions, whereas others have nearly\nconstant intrusive thoughts or compulsions that can be incapacitating).\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Onset after age 35 years is unusual but does occur. Males have an earlier age\nat onset than females: nearly 25% of males have onset before age 10 years. The onset of\nsymptoms is typically gradual; however, acute onset has also been reported.\nIf OCD is untreated, the course is usually chronic, often with waxing and waning symp-\ntoms. Some individuals have an episodic course, and a minority have a deteriorating\ncourse. Without treatment, remission rates in adults are low (e.g., 20% for those reevalu-\nated 40 years later). Onset in childhood or adolescence can lead to a lifetime of OCD. How-\never, 40% of individuals with onset of OCD in childhood or adolescence may experience\nremission by early adulthood. The course of OCD is often complicated by the co-occurrence\nof other disorders (see section “Comorbidity” for this disorder).\nCompulsions are more easily diagnosed in children than obsessions are because com-\npulsions are observable. However, most children have both obsessions and compulsions\n(as do most adults). The pattern of symptoms in adults can be stable over time, but it is\nmore variable in children. Some differences in the content of obsessions and compulsions\nhave been reported when children and adolescent samples have been compared with\nadult samples. These differences likely reflect content appropriate to different develop-\nmental stages (e.g., higher rates of sexual and religious obsessions in adolescents than in\nchildren; higher rates of harm obsessions [e.g., fears of catastrophic events, such as death\nor illness to self or loved ones] in children and adolescents than in adults).\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Require the model to choose which disorder is the better match based on the type and severity of impairment.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Functional Consequences]\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder\nOCD is associated with reduced quality of life as well as high levels of social and occupa-\ntional impairment. Impairment occurs across many different domains of life and is asso-\nciated with symptom severity. Impairment can be caused by the time spent obsessing and\ndoing compulsions. Avoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions or compulsions\ncan also severely restrict functioning. In addition, specific symptoms can create specific\nobstacles. For example, obsessions about harm can make relationships with family and\nfriends feel hazardous; the result can be avoidance of these relationships. Obsessions\nabout symmetry can derail the timely completion of school or work projects because the\nproject never feels “just right,” potentially resulting in school failure or job loss. Health\nconsequences can also occur. For example, individuals with contamination concerns may\navoid doctors’ offices and hospitals (e.g., because of fears of exposure to germs) or develop\ndermatological problems (e.g., skin lesions due to excessive washing). Sometimes the\nsymptoms of the disorder interfere with its own treatment (e.g., when medications are con-\nsidered contaminated). When the disorder starts in childhood or adolescence, individuals\nmay experience developmental difficulties. For example, adolescents may avoid socializ-\ning with peers; young adults may struggle when they leave home to live independently.\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder\n241\nThe result can be few significant relationships outside the family and a lack of autonomy\nand financial independence from their family of origin. In addition, some individuals with\nOCD try to impose rules and prohibitions on family members because of their disorder\n(e.g., no one in the family can have visitors to the house for fear of contamination), and this\ncan lead to family dysfunction.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

However, the recurrent thoughts that are\npresent in generalized anxiety disorder (i.e., worries) are usually about real-life concerns,\nwhereas the obsessions of OCD usually do not involve real-life concerns and can include\ncontent that is odd, irrational, or of a seemingly magical nature; moreover, compulsions\nare often present and usually linked to the obsessions. Like individuals with OCD, indi-\nviduals with specific phobia can have a fear reaction to specific objects or situations; how-\never, in specific phobia the feared object is usually much more circumscribed, and rituals\nare not present. In social anxiety disorder (social phobia), the feared objects or situations\nare limited to social interactions, and avoidance or reassurance seeking is focused on re-\nducing this social fear.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nOCD can be distinguished from the rumination of major\ndepressive disorder, in which thoughts are usually mood-congruent and not necessarily\nexperienced as intrusive or distressing; moreover, ruminations are not linked to compul-\nsions, as is typical in OCD.\nOther obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nIn body dysmorphic disorder, the\nobsessions and compulsions are limited to concerns about physical appearance; and in\ntrichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), the compulsive behavior is limited to hair pulling\nin the absence of obsessions. Hoarding disorder symptoms focus exclusively on the per-\nsistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, marked distress associated with\ndiscarding items, and excessive accumulation of objects. However, if an individual has ob-\nsessions that are typical of OCD (e.g., concerns about incompleteness or harm), and these\nobsessions lead to compulsive hoarding behaviors (e.g., acquiring all objects in a set to at-\ntain a sense of completeness or not discarding old newspapers because they may contain\ninformation that could prevent harm), a diagnosis of OCD should be given instead.\nEating disorders.\nOCD can be distinguished from anorexia nervosa in that in OCD the\nobsessions and compulsions are not limited to concerns about weight and food.\nTics (in tic disorder) and stereotyped movements.\nA tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent,\nnonrhythmic motor movement or vocalization (e.g., eye blinking, throat clearing). A ste-\nreotyped movement is a repetitive, seemingly driven, nonfunctional motor behavior (e.g.,\nhead banging, body rocking, self-biting). Tics and stereotyped movements are typically\nless complex than compulsions and are not aimed at neutralizing obsessions. However,\ndistinguishing between complex tics and compulsions can be difficult. Whereas compul-\nsions are usually preceded by obsessions, tics are often preceded by premonitory sensory\nurges. Some individuals have symptoms of both OCD and a tic disorder, in which case\nboth diagnoses may be warranted.\nPsychotic disorders.\nSome individuals with OCD have poor insight or even delusional\nOCD beliefs. However, they have obsessions and compulsions (distinguishing their\ncondition from delusional disorder) and do not have other features of schizophrenia or\nschizoaffective disorder (e.g., hallucinations or formal thought disorder).\nOther compulsive-like behaviors.\nCertain behaviors are sometimes described as “com-\npulsive,” including sexual behavior (in the case of paraphilias), gambling (i.e., gambling\n242\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\ndisorder), and substance use (e.g., alcohol use disorder). However, these behaviors differ\nfrom the compulsions of OCD in that the person usually derives pleasure from the activity\nand may wish to resist it only because of its deleterious consequences.\nObsessive-compulsive personality disorder.\nAlthough obsessive-compulsive person-\nality disorder and OCD have similar names, the clinical manifestations of these disorders\nare quite different. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is not characterized by in-\ntrusive thoughts, images, or urges or by repetitive behaviors that are performed in re-\nsponse to these intrusions; instead, it involves an enduring and pervasive maladaptive\npattern of excessive perfectionism and rigid control. If an individual manifests symptoms\nof both OCD and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, both diagnoses can be given.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each case should highlight overlapping symptom profiles where multiple comorbid disorders are possible, and require choosing the primary diagnosis with justification.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Comorbidity]\nIndividuals with OCD often have other psychopathology. Many adults with the disorder\nhave a lifetime diagnosis of an anxiety disorder (76%; e.g., panic disorder, social anxiety\ndisorder, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia) or a depressive or bipolar disorder\n(63% for any depressive or bipolar disorder, with the most common being major depres-\nsive disorder [41%]). Onset of OCD is usually later than for most comorbid anxiety disor-\nders (with the exception of separation anxiety disorder) and PTSD but often precedes that\nof depressive disorders. Comorbid obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is also\ncommon in individuals with OCD (e.g., ranging from 23% to 32%).\nUp to 30% of individuals with OCD also have a lifetime tic disorder. A comorbid tic\ndisorder is most common in males with onset of OCD in childhood. These individuals\ntend to differ from those without a history of tic disorders in the themes of their OCD\nsymptoms, comorbidity, course, and pattern of familial transmission. A triad of OCD, tic\ndisorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder can also be seen in children.\nDisorders that occur more frequently in individuals with OCD than in those without\nthe disorder include several obsessive-compulsive and related disorders such as body\ndysmorphic disorder, trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), and excoriation (skin-pick-\ning) disorder. Finally, an association between OCD and some disorders characterized by\nimpulsivity, such as oppositional defiant disorder, has been reported.\nOCD is also much more common in individuals with certain other disorders than\nwould be expected based on its prevalence in the general population; when one of those\nother disorders is diagnosed, the individual should be assessed for OCD as well. For ex-\nample, in individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the prevalence of\nOCD is approximately 12%. Rates of OCD are also elevated in bipolar disorder; eating dis-\norders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa; and Tourette’s disorder.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

{"uuid": "fda9b2e2-bfed-4567-bfea-94a158c68ffa", "disorder": "Hoarding Disorder", "section": "diagnostic_features", "task": "3C", "qa_count": 2, "prompt": "Using the Diagnostic Features section, generate 2 contrastive diagnostic reasoning examples. Each must present overlapping symptoms, two possible diagnoses, and justify why one is preferred.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Features]\nThe essential feature of hoarding disorder is persistent difficulties discarding or parting\nwith possessions, regardless of their actual value (Criterion A). The term persistent indi-\ncates a long-standing difficulty rather than more transient life circumstances that may lead\nto excessive clutter, such as inheriting property. The difficulty in discarding possessions\nnoted in Criterion A refers to any form of discarding, including throwing away, selling,\ngiving away, or recycling. The main reasons given for these difficulties are the perceived\nutility or aesthetic value of the items or strong sentimental attachment to the possessions.\nSome individuals feel responsible for the fate of their possessions and often go to great\nlengths to avoid being wasteful. Fears of losing important information are also common.\nThe most commonly saved items are newspapers, magazines, old clothing, bags, books,\nmail, and paperwork, but virtually any item can be saved. The nature of items is not lim-\nited to possessions that most other people would define as useless or of limited value.\nMany individuals collect and save large numbers of valuable things as well, which are of-\nten found in piles mixed with other less valuable items.\nIndividuals with hoarding disorder purposefully save possessions and experience dis-\ntress when facing the prospect of discarding them (Criterion B). This criterion emphasizes\nthat the saving of possessions is intentional, which discriminates hoarding disorder from\nother forms of psychopathology that are characterized by the passive accumulation of\nitems or the absence of distress when possessions are removed.\nIndividuals accumulate large numbers of items that fill up and clutter active living ar-\neas to the extent that their intended use is no longer possible (Criterion C). For example,\nthe individual may not be able to cook in the kitchen, sleep in his or her bed, or sit in a\nchair. If the space can be used, it is only with great difficulty. Clutter is defined as a large\ngroup of usually unrelated or marginally related objects piled together in a disorganized\nfashion in spaces designed for other purposes (e.g., tabletops, floor, hallway). Criterion C\nemphasizes the “active” living areas of the home, rather than more peripheral areas, such\nas garages, attics, or basements, that are sometimes cluttered in homes of individuals with-\nout hoarding disorder. However, individuals with hoarding disorder often have posses-\nsions that spill beyond the active living areas and can occupy and impair the use of other\nspaces, such as vehicles, yards, the workplace, and friends’ and relatives’ houses. In some\ncases, living areas may be uncluttered because of the intervention of third parties (e.g.,\nfamily members, cleaners, local authorities). Individuals who have been forced to clear\ntheir homes still have a symptom picture that meets criteria for hoarding disorder because\nthe lack of clutter is due to a third-party intervention. Hoarding disorder contrasts with\nnormative collecting behavior, which is organized and systematic, even if in some cases\nthe actual amount of possessions may be similar to the amount accumulated by an indi-\nvidual with hoarding disorder. Normative collecting does not produce the clutter, dis-\ntress, or impairment typical of hoarding disorder.\nSymptoms (i.e., difficulties discarding and/or clutter) must cause clinically significant\ndistress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning, in-\ncluding maintaining a safe environment for self and others (Criterion D). In some cases,\nHoarding Disorder\n249\nparticularly when there is poor insight, the individual may not report distress, and the im-\npairment may be apparent only to those around the individual. However, any attempts to\ndiscard or clear the possessions by third parties result in high levels of distress.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

In these individuals, the hoarding behavior is not present\nprior to the onset of the brain damage and appears shortly after the brain damage occurs.\nSome of these individuals appear to have little interest in the accumulated items and are\nable to discard them easily or do not care if others discard them, whereas others appear to\nbe very reluctant to discard anything.\nNeurodevelopmental disorders.\nHoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumula-\ntion of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of a neurodevelopmental disorder, such\nas autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).\nSchizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.\nHoarding disorder is not di-\nagnosed if the accumulation of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of delusions or\nnegative symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.\nMajor depressive episode.\nHoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of\nobjects is judged to be a direct consequence of psychomotor retardation, fatigue, or loss of\nenergy during a major depressive episode.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nHoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms\nare judged to be a direct consequence of typical obsessions or compulsions, such as fears\nof contamination, harm, or feelings of incompleteness in obsessive-compulsive disorder\n(OCD). Feelings of incompleteness (e.g., losing one’s identity, or having to document and\npreserve all life experiences) are the most frequent OCD symptoms associated with this\nform of hoarding. The accumulation of objects can also be the result of persistently avoid-\nTrichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)\n251\ning onerous rituals (e.g., not discarding objects in order to avoid endless washing or check-\ning rituals).\nIn OCD, the behavior is generally unwanted and highly distressing, and the individual ex-\nperiences no pleasure or reward from it. Excessive acquisition is usually not present; if exces-\nsive acquisition is present, items are acquired because of a specific obsession (e.g., the need to\nbuy items that have been accidentally touched in order to avoid contaminating other people),\nnot because of a genuine desire to possess the items. Individuals who hoard in the context of\nOCD are also more likely to accumulate bizarre items, such as trash, feces, urine, nails, hair,\nused diapers, or rotten food. Accumulation of such items is very unusual in hoarding disorder.\nWhen severe hoarding appears concurrently with other typical symptoms of OCD but\nis judged to be independent from these symptoms, both hoarding disorder and OCD may\nbe diagnosed.\nNeurocognitive disorders.\nHoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of\nobjects is judged to be a direct consequence of a degenerative disorder, such as neurocog-\nnitive disorder associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration or Alzheimer’s disease.\nTypically, onset of the accumulating behavior is gradual and follows onset of the neuro-\ncognitive disorder. The accumulating behavior may be accompanied by self-neglect and\nsevere domestic squalor, alongside other neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as disinhibi-\ntion, gambling, rituals/stereotypies, tics, and self-injurious behaviors.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each must present overlapping symptoms, two possible diagnoses, and justify why one is preferred.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Features]\nThe essential feature of borderline personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of instability\nof interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity that begins\nby early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts.\nIndividuals with borderline personality disorder make frantic efforts to avoid real or\nimagined abandonment (Criterion 1). The perception of impending separation or rejection,\nor the loss of external structure, can lead to profound changes in self-image, affect, cognition,\nand behavior. These individuals are very sensitive to environmental circumstances. They ex-\nperience intense abandonment fears and inappropriate anger even when faced with a real-\nistic time-limited separation or when there are unavoidable changes in plans (e.g., sudden\ndespair in reaction to a clinician’s announcing the end of the hour; panic or fury when some-\none important to them is just a few minutes late or must cancel an appointment). They may\nbelieve that this “abandonment” implies they are “bad.” These abandonment fears are re-\nlated to an intolerance of being alone and a need to have other people with them. Their frantic\n664\nPersonality Disorders\nefforts to avoid abandonment may include impulsive actions such as self-mutilating or sui-\ncidal behaviors, which are described separately in Criterion 5.\nIndividuals with borderline personality disorder have a pattern of unstable and intense\nrelationships (Criterion 2). They may idealize potential caregivers or lovers at the first or\nsecond meeting, demand to spend a lot of time together, and share the most intimate details\nearly in a relationship. However, they may switch quickly from idealizing other people to\ndevaluing them, feeling that the other person does not care enough, does not give enough,\nor is not “there” enough. These individuals can empathize with and nurture other people,\nbut only with the expectation that the other person will “be there” in return to meet their\nown needs on demand. These individuals are prone to sudden and dramatic shifts in their\nview of others, who may alternatively be seen as beneficent supports or as cruelly punitive.\nSuch shifts often reflect disillusionment with a caregiver whose nurturing qualities had\nbeen idealized or whose rejection or abandonment is expected.\nThere may be an identity disturbance characterized by markedly and persistently un-\nstable self-image or sense of self (Criterion 3). There are sudden and dramatic shifts in self-\nimage, characterized by shifting goals, values, and vocational aspirations. There may be\nsudden changes in opinions and plans about career, sexual identity, values, and types of\nfriends. These individuals may suddenly change from the role of a needy supplicant for\nhelp to that of a righteous avenger of past mistreatment. Although they usually have a self-\nimage that is based on being bad or evil, individuals with this disorder may at times have\nfeelings that they do not exist at all. Such experiences usually occur in situations in which\nthe individual feels a lack of a meaningful relationship, nurturing, and support. These in-\ndividuals may show worse performance in unstructured work or school situations.\nIndividuals with borderline personality disorder display impulsivity in at least two areas\nthat are potentially self-damaging (Criterion 4). They may gamble, spend money irrespon-\nsibly, binge eat, abuse substances, engage in unsafe sex, or drive recklessly. Individuals\nwith this disorder display recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilat-\ning behavior (Criterion 5). Completed suicide occurs in 8%–10% of such individuals, and\nself-mutilative acts (e.g., cutting or burning) and suicide threats and attempts are very\ncommon. Recurrent suicidality is often the reason that these individuals present for help.\nThese self-destructive acts are usually precipitated by threats of separation or rejection or\nby expectations that the individual assumes increased responsibility. Self-mutilation may\noccur during dissociative experiences and often brings relief by reaffirming the ability to\nfeel or by expiating the individual’s sense of being evil.\nIndividuals with borderline personality disorder may display affective instability that\nis due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anx-\niety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days) (Criterion 6). The\nbasic dysphoric mood of those with borderline personality disorder is often disrupted by\nperiods of anger, panic, or despair and is rarely relieved by periods of well-being or satis-\nfaction. These episodes may reflect the individual’s extreme reactivity to interpersonal\nstresses. Individuals with borderline personality disorder may be troubled by chronic feel-\nings of emptiness (Criterion 7). Easily bored, they may constantly seek something to do.\nIndividuals with this disorder frequently express inappropriate, intense anger or have dif-\nficulty controlling their anger (Criterion 8). They may display extreme sarcasm, enduring\nbitterness, or verbal outbursts. The anger is often elicited when a caregiver or lover is seen\nas neglectful, withholding, uncaring, or abandoning. Such expressions of anger are often\nfollowed by shame and guilt and contribute to the feeling they have of being evil. During\nperiods of extreme stress, transient paranoid ideation or dissociative symptoms (e.g., de-\npersonalization) may occur (Criterion 9), but these are generally of insufficient severity or\nduration to warrant an additional diagnosis. These episodes occur most frequently in re-\nsponse to a real or imagined abandonment. Symptoms tend to be transient, lasting min-\nutes or hours. The real or perceived return of the caregiver’s nurturance may result in a\nremission of symptoms.\nBorderline Personality Disorder\n665\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

The impairment from the disorder and the risk of suicide are greatest in the\nyoung-adult years and gradually wane with advancing age. Although the tendency to-\nward intense emotions, impulsivity, and intensity in relationships is often lifelong, indi-\nviduals who engage in therapeutic intervention often show improvement beginning\nsometime during the first year. During their 30s and 40s, the majority of individuals with\nthis disorder attain greater stability in their relationships and vocational functioning. Fol-\nlow-up studies of individuals identified through outpatient mental health clinics indicate\nthat after about 10 years, as many as half of the individuals no longer have a pattern of be-\nhavior that meets full criteria for borderline personality disorder.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each case should describe overlapping symptoms and require choosing between two similar disorders, with a contrastive justification.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Differential Diagnosis]\nDepressive and bipolar disorders.\nBorderline personality disorder often co-occurs with\ndepressive or bipolar disorders, and when criteria for both are met, both may be diagnosed.\nBecause the cross-sectional presentation of borderline personality disorder can be mimicked\nby an episode of depressive or bipolar disorder, the clinician should avoid giving an addi-\ntional diagnosis of borderline personality disorder based only on cross-sectional presenta-\ntion without having documented that the pattern of behavior had an early onset and a long-\nstanding course.\nOther personality disorders.\nOther personality disorders may be confused with border-\nline personality disorder because they have certain features in common. It is therefore im-\nportant to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in their characteristic\nfeatures. However, if an individual has personality features that meet criteria for one or\nmore personality disorders in addition to borderline personality disorder, all can be diag-\nnosed. Although histrionic personality disorder can also be characterized by attention seek-\ning, manipulative behavior, and rapidly shifting emotions, borderline personality disorder\nis distinguished by self-destructiveness, angry disruptions in close relationships, and\nchronic feelings of deep emptiness and loneliness. Paranoid ideas or illusions may be pres-\nent in both borderline personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder, but these\nsymptoms are more transient, interpersonally reactive, and responsive to external structur-\ning in borderline personality disorder. Although paranoid personality disorder and narcis-\nsistic personality disorder may also be characterized by an angry reaction to minor stimuli,\nthe relative stability of self-image, as well as the relative lack of self-destructiveness, impul-\nsivity, and abandonment concerns, distinguishes these disorders from borderline person-\nality disorder. Although antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder\nare both characterized by manipulative behavior, individuals with antisocial personality\ndisorder are manipulative to gain profit, power, or some other material gratification,\nwhereas the goal in borderline personality disorder is directed more toward gaining the con-\ncern of caretakers. Both dependent personality disorder and borderline personality disorder\nare characterized by fear of abandonment; however, the individual with borderline person-\nality disorder reacts to abandonment with feelings of emotional emptiness, rage, and de-\nmands, whereas the individual with dependent personality disorder reacts with increasing\nappeasement and submissiveness and urgently seeks a replacement relationship to provide\ncaregiving and support. Borderline personality disorder can further be distinguished from\ndependent personality disorder by the typical pattern of unstable and intense relationships.\nPersonality change due to another medical condition.\nBorderline personality disor-\nder must be distinguished from personality change due to another medical condition, in\nwhich the traits that emerge are attributable to the effects of another medical condition on\nthe central nervous system.\nSubstance use disorders.\nBorderline personality disorder must also be distinguished\nfrom symptoms that may develop in association with persistent substance use.\nIdentity problems.\nBorderline personality disorder should be distinguished from an\nidentity problem, which is reserved for identity concerns related to a developmental phase\n(e.g., adolescence) and does not qualify as a mental disorder.\nHistrionic Personality Disorder\n667\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each must present overlapping symptoms, two possible diagnoses, and justify why one is preferred.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Features]\nThe essential feature of narcissistic personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of grandi-\nosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy that begins by early adulthood and is pres-\nent in a variety of contexts.\nIndividuals with this disorder have a grandiose sense of self-importance (Criterion 1).\nThey routinely overestimate their abilities and inflate their accomplishments, often appearing\nboastful and pretentious. They may blithely assume that others attribute the same value to\ntheir efforts and may be surprised when the praise they expect and feel they deserve is not\nforthcoming. Often implicit in the inflated judgments of their own accomplishments is an un-\nderestimation (devaluation) of the contributions of others. Individuals with narcissistic per-\nsonality disorder are often preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance,\nbeauty, or ideal love (Criterion 2). They may ruminate about “long overdue” admiration and\nprivilege and compare themselves favorably with famous or privileged people.\nIndividuals with narcissistic personality disorder believe that they are superior, spe-\ncial, or unique and expect others to recognize them as such (Criterion 3). They may feel\nthat they can only be understood by, and should only associate with, other people who are\nspecial or of high status and may attribute “unique,” “perfect,” or “gifted” qualities to those\nwith whom they associate. Individuals with this disorder believe that their needs are spe-\ncial and beyond the ken of ordinary people. Their own self-esteem is enhanced (i.e., “mir-\nrored”) by the idealized value that they assign to those with whom they associate. They are\nlikely to insist on having only the “top” person (doctor, lawyer, hairdresser, instructor) or\nbeing affiliated with the “best” institutions but may devalue the credentials of those who dis-\nappoint them.\nIndividuals with this disorder generally require excessive admiration (Criterion 4). Their\nself-esteem is almost invariably very fragile. They may be preoccupied with how well they\nare doing and how favorably they are regarded by others. This often takes the form of a need\nfor constant attention and admiration. They may expect their arrival to be greeted with great\nfanfare and are astonished if others do not covet their possessions. They may constantly fish\nfor compliments, often with great charm. A sense of entitlement is evident in these individ-\nuals’ unreasonable expectation of especially favorable treatment (Criterion 5). They expect\nto be catered to and are puzzled or furious when this does not happen. For example, they\nmay assume that they do not have to wait in line and that their priorities are so important\nthat others should defer to them, and then get irritated when others fail to assist “in their\nvery important work.” This sense of entitlement, combined with a lack of sensitivity to the\nwants and needs of others, may result in the conscious or unwitting exploitation of others\n(Criterion 6). They expect to be given whatever they want or feel they need, no matter what\nit might mean to others. For example, these individuals may expect great dedication from\nothers and may overwork them without regard for the impact on their lives. They tend to\nform friendships or romantic relationships only if the other person seems likely to advance\ntheir purposes or otherwise enhance their self-esteem. They often usurp special privileges\nand extra resources that they believe they deserve because they are so special.\nIndividuals with narcissistic personality disorder generally have a lack of empathy and\nhave difficulty recognizing the desires, subjective experiences, and feelings of others (Crite-\nrion 7). They may assume that others are totally concerned about their welfare. They tend to\ndiscuss their own concerns in inappropriate and lengthy detail, while failing to recognize\nthat others also have feelings and needs. They are often contemptuous and impatient with\nNarcissistic Personality Disorder\n671\nothers who talk about their own problems and concerns. These individuals may be oblivious\nto the hurt their remarks may inflict (e.g., exuberantly telling a former lover that “I am now\nin the relationship of a lifetime!”; boasting of health in front of someone who is sick). When\nrecognized, the needs, desires, or feelings of others are likely to be viewed disparagingly as\nsigns of weakness or vulnerability. Those who relate to individuals with narcissistic person-\nality disorder typically find an emotional coldness and lack of reciprocal interest.\nThese individuals are often envious of others or believe that others are envious of them\n(Criterion 8). They may begrudge others their successes or possessions, feeling that they better\ndeserve those achievements, admiration, or privileges. They may harshly devalue the contri-\nbutions of others, particularly when those individuals have received acknowledgment or\npraise for their accomplishments. Arrogant, haughty behaviors characterize these individuals;\nthey often display snobbish, disdainful, or patronizing attitudes (Criterion 9). For example, an\nindividual with this disorder may complain about a clumsy waiter’s “rudeness” or “stupidity”\nor conclude a medical evaluation with a condescending evaluation of the physician.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each case should describe overlapping symptoms and require choosing between two similar disorders, with a contrastive justification.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Differential Diagnosis]\nOther personality disorders and personality traits.\nOther personality disorders may\nbe confused with narcissistic personality disorder because they have certain features in\n672\nPersonality Disorders\ncommon. It is, therefore, important to distinguish among these disorders based on differ-\nences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features\nthat meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to narcissistic person-\nality disorder, all can be diagnosed. The most useful feature in discriminating narcissistic\npersonality disorder from histrionic, antisocial, and borderline personality disorders, in\nwhich the interactive styles are coquettish, callous, and needy, respectively, is the grandi-\nosity characteristic of narcissistic personality disorder. The relative stability of self-image\nas well as the relative lack of self-destructiveness, impulsivity, and abandonment concerns\nalso help distinguish narcissistic personality disorder from borderline personality disor-\nder. Excessive pride in achievements, a relative lack of emotional display, and disdain for\nothers’ sensitivities help distinguish narcissistic personality disorder from histrionic\npersonality disorder. Although individuals with borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic\npersonality disorders may require much attention, those with narcissistic personality dis-\norder specifically need that attention to be admiring. Individuals with antisocial and nar-\ncissistic personality disorders share a tendency to be tough-minded, glib, superficial,\nexploitative, and unempathic. However, narcissistic personality disorder does not neces-\nsarily include characteristics of impulsivity, aggression, and deceit. In addition, individu-\nals with antisocial personality disorder may not be as needy of the admiration and envy of\nothers, and persons with narcissistic personality disorder usually lack the history of con-\nduct disorder in childhood or criminal behavior in adulthood. In both narcissistic person-\nality disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, the individual may profess\na commitment to perfectionism and believe that others cannot do things as well. In con-\ntrast to the accompanying self-criticism of those with obsessive-compulsive personality\ndisorder, individuals with narcissistic personality disorder are more likely to believe that\nthey have achieved perfection. Suspiciousness and social withdrawal usually distinguish\nthose with schizotypal or paranoid personality disorder from those with narcissistic per-\nsonality disorder. When these qualities are present in individuals with narcissistic person-\nality disorder, they derive primarily from fears of having imperfections or flaws revealed.\nMany highly successful individuals display personality traits that might be considered\nnarcissistic. Only when these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause\nsignificant functional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute narcissistic per-\nsonality disorder.\nMania or hypomania.\nGrandiosity may emerge as part of manic or hypomanic episodes,\nbut the association with mood change or functional impairments helps distinguish these\nepisodes from narcissistic personality disorder.\nSubstance use disorders.\nNarcissistic personality disorder must also be distinguished\nfrom symptoms that may develop in association with persistent substance use.\nCluster C Personality Disorders\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each must present overlapping symptoms, two possible diagnoses, and justify why one is preferred.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Features]\nThe essential feature of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is a preoccupation\nwith orderliness, perfectionism, and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of\nflexibility, openness, and efficiency. This pattern begins by early adulthood and is present\nin a variety of contexts.\nIndividuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder attempt to maintain a\nsense of control through painstaking attention to rules, trivial details, procedures, lists,\nschedules, or form to the extent that the major point of the activity is lost (Criterion 1). They\nare excessively careful and prone to repetition, paying extraordinary attention to detail\nand repeatedly checking for possible mistakes. They are oblivious to the fact that other\npeople tend to become very annoyed at the delays and inconveniences that result from this\nbehavior. For example, when such individuals misplace a list of things to be done, they\nwill spend an inordinate amount of time looking for the list rather than spending a few\nmoments re-creating it from memory and proceeding to accomplish the tasks. Time is\npoorly allocated, and the most important tasks are left to the last moment. The perfection-\nism and self-imposed high standards of performance cause significant dysfunction and\ndistress in these individuals. They may become so involved in making every detail of a\nproject absolutely perfect that the project is never finished (Criterion 2). For example, the\ncompletion of a written report is delayed by numerous time-consuming rewrites that all\ncome up short of “perfection.” Deadlines are missed, and aspects of the individual’s life\nthat are not the current focus of activity may fall into disarray.\nIndividuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder display excessive devotion\nto work and productivity to the exclusion of leisure activities and friendships (Criterion 3).\nThis behavior is not accounted for by economic necessity. They often feel that they do not\nhave time to take an evening or a weekend day off to go on an outing or to just relax. They\nmay keep postponing a pleasurable activity, such as a vacation, so that it may never occur.\nWhen they do take time for leisure activities or vacations, they are very uncomfortable un-\nless they have taken along something to work on so they do not “waste time.” There may be\na great concentration on household chores (e.g., repeated excessive cleaning so that “one\ncould eat off the floor”). If they spend time with friends, it is likely to be in some kind of for-\nmally organized activity (e.g., sports). Hobbies or recreational activities are approached as\nserious tasks requiring careful organization and hard work to master. The emphasis is on\nperfect performance. These individuals turn play into a structured task (e.g., correcting an\ninfant for not putting rings on the post in the right order; telling a toddler to ride his or her tri-\ncycle in a straight line; turning a baseball game into a harsh “lesson”).\nIndividuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder may be excessively con-\nscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about matters of morality, ethics, or values (Crite-\nrion 4). They may force themselves and others to follow rigid moral principles and very\nstrict standards of performance. They may also be mercilessly self-critical about their own\nmistakes. Individuals with this disorder are rigidly deferential to authority and rules and\ninsist on quite literal compliance, with no rule bending for extenuating circumstances. For\nexample, the individual will not lend a quarter to a friend who needs one to make a tele-\nphone call because “neither a borrower nor a lender be” or because it would be “bad” for\n680\nPersonality Disorders\nthe person’s character. These qualities should not be accounted for by the individual’s cul-\ntural or religious identification.\nIndividuals with this disorder may be unable to discard worn-out or worthless objects,\neven when they have no sentimental value (Criterion 5). Often these individuals will ad-\nmit to being “pack rats.” They regard discarding objects as wasteful because “you never\nknow when you might need something” and will become upset if someone tries to get rid of\nthe things they have saved. Their spouses or roommates may complain about the amount of\nspace taken up by old parts, magazines, broken appliances, and so on.\nIndividuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder are reluctant to delegate\ntasks or to work with others (Criterion 6). They stubbornly and unreasonably insist that\neverything be done their way and that people conform to their way of doing things. They\noften give very detailed instructions about how things should be done (e.g., there is one\nand only one way to mow the lawn, wash the dishes, build a doghouse) and are surprised\nand irritated if others suggest creative alternatives. At other times they may reject offers of\nhelp even when behind schedule because they believe no one else can do it right.\nIndividuals with this disorder may be miserly and stingy and maintain a standard of\nliving far below what they can afford, believing that spending must be tightly controlled to\nprovide for future catastrophes (Criterion 7). Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder\nis characterized by rigidity and stubbornness (Criterion 8). Individuals with this disorder\nare so concerned about having things done the one “correct” way that they have trouble\ngoing along with anyone else’s ideas. These individuals plan ahead in meticulous detail\nand are unwilling to consider changes. Totally wrapped up in their own perspective, they\nhave difficulty acknowledging the viewpoints of others. Friends and colleagues may be-\ncome frustrated by this constant rigidity. Even when individuals with obsessive-compul-\nsive personality disorder recognize that it may be in their interest to compromise, they\nmay stubbornly refuse to do so, arguing that it is “the principle of the thing.”\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

When criteria for both obsessive-compulsive person-\nality disorder and OCD are met, both diagnoses should be recorded.\nHoarding disorder.\nA diagnosis of hoarding disorder should be considered especially\nwhen hoarding is extreme (e.g., accumulated stacks of worthless objects present a fire haz-\nard and make it difficult for others to walk through the house).

It is, therefore, important to distinguish among these disorders based\non differences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality\nfeatures that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to obsessive-\ncompulsive personality disorder, all can be diagnosed. Individuals with narcissistic per-\nsonality disorder may also profess a commitment to perfectionism and believe that others\ncannot do things as well, but these individuals are more likely to believe that they have\nachieved perfection, whereas those with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder are\nusually self-critical.

Both schizoid\npersonality disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder may be characterized\nby an apparent formality and social detachment.

Apart from the impact of the delusion(s) or its ramifications, functioning is not markedly\nimpaired, and behavior is not obviously bizarre or odd.\nD. If manic or major depressive episodes have occurred, these have been brief relative\nto the duration of the delusional periods.\nE. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or an-\nother medical condition and is not better explained by another mental disorder, such\nas body dysmorphic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nSpecify whether:\nErotomanic type: This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion is that\nanother person is in love with the individual.\nGrandiose type: This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion is the\nconviction of having some great (but unrecognized) talent or insight or having made\nsome important discovery.\nJealous type: This subtype applies when the central theme of the individual’s delusion\nis that his or her spouse or lover is unfaithful.\nPersecutory type: This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion in-\nvolves the individual’s belief that he or she is being conspired against, cheated, spied\non, followed, poisoned or drugged, maliciously maligned, harassed, or obstructed in\nthe pursuit of long-term goals.\nSomatic type: This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion involves\nbodily functions or sensations.\nDelusional Disorder\n91\nMixed type: This subtype applies when no one delusional theme predominates.\nUnspecified type: This subtype applies when the dominant delusional belief cannot\nbe clearly determined or is not described in the specific types (e.g., referential delu-\nsions without a prominent persecutory or grandiose component).\nSpecify if:\nWith bizarre content: Delusions are deemed bizarre if they are clearly implausible, not\nunderstandable, and not derived from ordinary life experiences (e.g., an individual’s be-\nlief that a stranger has removed his or her internal organs and replaced them with some-\none else’s organs without leaving any wounds or scars).\nSpecify if:\nThe following course specifiers are only to be used after a 1-year duration of the disorder:\nFirst episode, currently in acute episode: First manifestation of the disorder meet-\ning the defining diagnostic symptom and time criteria.

Each must present overlapping symptoms, two possible diagnoses, and justify why one is preferred.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Features]\nThe characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia involve a range of cognitive, behavioral, and\nemotional dysfunctions, but no single symptom is pathognomonic of the disorder. The di-\nagnosis involves the recognition of a constellation of signs and symptoms associated with\nimpaired occupational or social functioning. Individuals with the disorder will vary sub-\nstantially on most features, as schizophrenia is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome.\nAt least two Criterion A symptoms must be present for a significant portion of time\nduring a 1-month period or longer. At least one of these symptoms must be the clear pres-\nence of delusions (Criterion A1), hallucinations (Criterion A2), or disorganized speech\n(Criterion A3). Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior (Criterion A4) and negative\nsymptoms (Criterion A5) may also be present. In those situations in which the active-\nphase symptoms remit within a month in response to treatment, Criterion A is still met if the\nclinician estimates that they would have persisted in the absence of treatment.\nSchizophrenia involves impairment in one or more major areas of functioning (Crite-\nrion B). If the disturbance begins in childhood or adolescence, the expected level of func-\ntion is not attained. Comparing the individual with unaffected siblings may be helpful. The\ndysfunction persists for a substantial period during the course of the disorder and does not\nappear to be a direct result of any single feature. Avolition (i.e., reduced drive to pursue\ngoal-directed behavior; Criterion A5) is linked to the social dysfunction described under\nCriterion B. There is also strong evidence for a relationship between cognitive impairment\n(see the section “Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis” for this disorder) and func-\ntional impairment in individuals with schizophrenia.\nSchizophrenia\n101\nSome signs of the disturbance must persist for a continuous period of at least 6 months\n(Criterion C). Prodromal symptoms often precede the active phase, and residual symp-\ntoms may follow it, characterized by mild or subthreshold forms of hallucinations or\ndelusions. Individuals may express a variety of unusual or odd beliefs that are not of de-\nlusional proportions (e.g., ideas of reference or magical thinking); they may have unusual\nperceptual experiences (e.g., sensing the presence of an unseen person); their speech may\nbe generally understandable but vague; and their behavior may be unusual but not grossly\ndisorganized (e.g., mumbling in public). Negative symptoms are common in the pro-\ndromal and residual phases and can be severe. Individuals who had been socially active\nmay become withdrawn from previous routines. Such behaviors are often the first sign of\na disorder.\nMood symptoms and full mood episodes are common in schizophrenia and may be con-\ncurrent with active-phase symptomatology. However, as distinct from a psychotic mood dis-\norder, a schizophrenia diagnosis requires the presence of delusions or hallucinations in the\nabsence of mood episodes. In addition, mood episodes, taken in total, should be present for\nonly a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.\nIn addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the\nassessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making crit-\nically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-\nchotic disorders.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

{"uuid": "a2f67c69-013b-4c13-8e2d-a38cd63130ad", "disorder": "Schizophrenia", "section": "development_course", "task": "3C", "qa_count": 2, "prompt": "From the Development and Course section, generate 2 ambiguous cases. Each should present a timeline of symptoms that could fit two disorders, and require contrastive reasoning based on onset, progression, or duration.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Development Course]\nThe psychotic features of schizophrenia typically emerge between the late teens and the\nmid-30s; onset prior to adolescence is rare. The peak age at onset for the first psychotic ep-\nisode is in the early- to mid-20s for males and in the late-20s for females. The onset may be\nabrupt or insidious, but the majority of individuals manifest a slow and gradual develop-\nment of a variety of clinically significant signs and symptoms. Half of these individuals\ncomplain of depressive symptoms. Earlier age at onset has traditionally been seen as a pre-\ndictor of worse prognosis. However, the effect of age at onset is likely related to gender,\nwith males having worse premorbid adjustment, lower educational achievement, more\nprominent negative symptoms and cognitive impairment, and in general a worse out-\ncome. Impaired cognition is common, and alterations in cognition are present during de-\nvelopment and precede the emergence of psychosis, taking the form of stable cognitive\nimpairments during adulthood. Cognitive impairments may persist when other symptoms\nare in remission and contribute to the disability of the disease.\nThe predictors of course and outcome are largely unexplained, and course and outcome\nmay not be reliably predicted. The course appears to be favorable in about 20% of those\nwith schizophrenia, and a small number of individuals are reported to recover completely.\nHowever, most individuals with schizophrenia still require formal or informal daily living\nsupports, and many remain chronically ill, with exacerbations and remissions of active\nsymptoms, while others have a course of progressive deterioration.\nPsychotic symptoms tend to diminish over the life course, perhaps in association with\nnormal age-related declines in dopamine activity. Negative symptoms are more closely re-\nlated to prognosis than are positive symptoms and tend to be the most persistent. Further-\nmore, cognitive deficits associated with the illness may not improve over the course of the\nillness.\nThe essential features of schizophrenia are the same in childhood, but it is more diffi-\ncult to make the diagnosis. In children, delusions and hallucinations may be less elaborate\nthan in adults, and visual hallucinations are more common and should be distinguished\nfrom normal fantasy play. Disorganized speech occurs in many disorders with childhood\nonset (e.g., autism spectrum disorder), as does disorganized behavior (e.g., attention-deficit/\nSchizophrenia\n103\nhyperactivity disorder). These symptoms should not be attributed to schizophrenia with-\nout due consideration of the more common disorders of childhood. Childhood-onset cases\ntend to resemble poor-outcome adult cases, with gradual onset and prominent negative\nsymptoms. Children who later receive the diagnosis of schizophrenia are more likely to\nhave experienced nonspecific emotional-behavioral disturbances and psychopathology,\nintellectual and language alterations, and subtle motor delays.\nLate-onset cases (i.e., onset after age 40 years) are overrepresented by females, who\nmay have married. Often, the course is characterized by a predominance of psychotic\nsymptoms with preservation of affect and social functioning. Such late-onset cases can still\nmeet the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, but it is not yet clear whether this is the\nsame condition as schizophrenia diagnosed prior to mid-life (e.g., prior to age 55 years).\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

In schizophreniform disorder, the disturbance is present less than 6 months, and in\nbrief psychotic disorder, symptoms are present at least 1 day but less than 1 month.\nDelusional disorder.\nDelusional disorder can be distinguished from schizophrenia by\nthe absence of the other symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia (e.g., delusions, prom-\ninent auditory or visual hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or cata-\ntonic behavior, negative symptoms).\nSchizotypal personality disorder.\nSchizotypal personality disorder may be distinguished\nfrom schizophrenia by subthreshold symptoms that are associated with persistent person-\nality features.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder.\nIndividuals with\nobsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder may present with poor or\nabsent insight, and the preoccupations may reach delusional proportions.

Individuals with a de-\nlirium or major or minor neurocognitive disorder may present with psychotic symptoms,\nbut these would have a temporal relationship to the onset of cognitive changes consistent\nwith those disorders. Individuals with substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder\nmay present with symptoms characteristic of Criterion A for schizophrenia, but the sub-\nstance/medication-induced psychotic disorder can usually be distinguished by the chron-\nological relationship of substance use to the onset and remission of the psychosis in the\nabsence of substance use.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Difficulty maintaining sleep, characterized by frequent awakenings or problems re-\nturning to sleep after awakenings.

The diagnosis of insomnia disorder is given whether it occurs as an independent\ncondition or is comorbid with another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder),\nmedical condition (e.g., pain), or another sleep disorder (e.g., a breathing-related sleep dis-\norder). For instance, insomnia may develop its own course with some anxiety and depres-\nsive features but in the absence of criteria being met for any one mental disorder. Insomnia\nmay also manifest as a clinical feature of a more predominant mental disorder. Persistent\ninsomnia may even be a risk factor for depression and is a common residual symptom af-\nter treatment for this condition. With comorbid insomnia and a mental disorder, treatment\nmay also need to target both conditions. Given these different courses, it is often impossi-\nble to establish the precise nature of the relationship between these clinical entities, and\nthis relationship may change over time. Therefore, in the presence of insomnia and a co-\nmorbid disorder, it is not necessary to make a causal attribution between the two condi-\ntions. Rather, the diagnosis of insomnia disorder is made with concurrent specification of\nthe clinically comorbid conditions. A concurrent insomnia diagnosis should only be con-\nsidered when the insomnia is sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention;\notherwise, no separate diagnosis is necessary.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Late insomnia involves early-morning awakening with an inability to return to sleep.\nDifficulty maintaining sleep is the most common single symptom of insomnia, followed by\ndifficulty falling asleep, while a combination of these symptoms is the most common presen-\ntation overall. The specific type of sleep complaint often varies over time. Individuals who\ncomplain of difficulty falling asleep at one time may later complain of difficulty maintaining\nsleep, and vice versa. Symptoms of difficulty falling asleep and difficulty maintaining sleep\ncan be quantified by the individual’s retrospective self-report, sleep diaries, or other methods,\nsuch as actigraphy or polysomnography, but the diagnosis of insomnia disorder is based on\nthe individual’s subjective perception of sleep or a caretaker’s report.\nNonrestorative sleep, a complaint of poor sleep quality that does not leave the individual\nrested upon awakening despite adequate duration, is a common sleep complaint usually\noccurring in association with difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or less frequently in\nisolation. This complaint can also be reported in association with other sleep disorders\n(e.g., breathing-related sleep disorder). When a complaint of nonrestorative sleep occurs\nin isolation (i.e., in the absence of difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep) but all di-\nagnostic criteria with regard to frequency, duration, and daytime distress and impairments\nare otherwise met, a diagnosis of other specified insomnia disorder or unspecified insom-\nnia disorder is made.\n364\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nAside from the frequency and duration criteria required to make the diagnosis, addi-\ntional criteria are useful to quantify insomnia severity. These quantitative criteria, while\narbitrary, are provided for illustrative purpose only. For instance, difficulty initiating sleep\nis defined by a subjective sleep latency greater than 20–30 minutes, and difficulty maintain-\ning sleep is defined by a subjective time awake after sleep onset greater than 20–30 min-\nutes. Although there is no standard definition of early-morning awakening, this symptom\ninvolves awakening at least 30 minutes before the scheduled time and before total sleep\ntime reaches 6½ hours. It is essential to take into account not only the final awakening time\nbut also the bedtime on the previous evening. Awakening at 4:00 A.M. does not have the\nsame clinical significance in those who go to bed at 9:00 P.M. as in those who go to bed at\n11:00 P.M. Such a symptom may also reflect an age-dependent decrease in the ability to sus-\ntain sleep or an age-dependent shift in the timing of the main sleep period.\nInsomnia disorder involves daytime impairments as well as nighttime sleep difficulties.\nThese include fatigue or, less commonly, daytime sleepiness; the latter is more common\namong older individuals and when insomnia is comorbid with another medical condition\n(e.g., chronic pain) or sleep disorder (e.g., sleep apnea). Impairment in cognitive performance\nmay include difficulties with attention, concentration and memory, and even with performing\nsimple manual skills. Associated mood disturbances are typically described as irritability or\nmood lability and less commonly as depressive or anxiety symptoms. Not all individuals with\nnighttime sleep disturbances are distressed or have functional impairment. For example, sleep\ncontinuity is often interrupted in healthy older adults who nevertheless identify themselves\nas good sleepers. A diagnosis of insomnia disorder should be reserved for those individuals\nwith significant daytime distress or impairment related to their nighttime sleep difficulties.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each should present a timeline of symptoms that could fit two disorders, and require contrastive reasoning based on onset, progression, or duration.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Development Course]\nThe onset of insomnia symptoms can occur at any time during life, but the first episode is\nmore common in young adulthood. Less frequently, insomnia begins in childhood or ad-\nolescence. In women, new-onset insomnia may occur during menopause and persist even\nafter other symptoms (e.g., hot flashes) have resolved. Insomnia may have a late-life onset,\nwhich is often associated with the onset of other health-related conditions.\nInsomnia can be situational, persistent, or recurrent. Situational or acute insomnia usu-\nally lasts a few days or a few weeks and is often associated with life events or rapid changes\nin sleep schedules or environment. It usually resolves once the initial precipitating event\nsubsides. For some individuals, perhaps those more vulnerable to sleep disturbances, in-\nsomnia may persist long after the initial triggering event, possibly because of conditioning\nfactors and heightened arousal. The factors that precipitate insomnia may differ from\nthose that perpetuate it. For example, an individual who is bedridden with a painful injury\nand has difficulty sleeping may then develop negative associations for sleep. Conditioned\narousal may then persist and lead to persistent insomnia. A similar course may develop in\nthe context of an acute psychological stress or a mental disorder. For instance, insomnia that\noccurs during an episode of major depressive disorder can become a focus of attention,\nwith consequent negative conditioning, and persist even after resolution of the depressive\nepisode. In some cases, insomnia may also have an insidious onset without any identifi-\nable precipitating factor.\nThe course of insomnia may also be episodic, with recurrent episodes of sleep difficul-\nties associated with the occurrence of stressful events. Chronicity rates range from 45%\nto 75% for follow-ups of 1–7 years. Even when the course of the insomnia has become\nchronic, there is night-to-night variability in sleep patterns, with an occasional restful night’s\nsleep interspersed with several nights of poor sleep. The characteristics of insomnia may\nalso change over time. Many individuals with insomnia have a history of “light” or easily\ndisturbed sleep prior to onset of more persistent sleep problems.\nInsomnia complaints are more prevalent among middle-age and older adults. The type\nof insomnia symptom changes as a function of age, with difficulties initiating sleep being\nmore common among young adults and problems maintaining sleep occurring more fre-\nquently among middle-age and older individuals.\nDifficulties initiating and maintaining sleep can also occur in children and adolescents,\nbut there are more limited data on prevalence, risk factors, and comorbidity during these\ndevelopmental phases of the lifespan. Sleep difficulties in childhood can result from con-\nditioning factors (e.g., a child who does not learn to fall asleep or return to sleep without\nthe presence of a parent) or from the absence of consistent sleep schedules and bedtime\nroutines. Insomnia in adolescence is often triggered or exacerbated by irregular sleep sched-\nules (e.g., phase delay). In both children and adolescents, psychological and medical fac-\ntors can contribute to insomnia.\nThe increased prevalence of insomnia in older adults is partly explained by the higher\nincidence of physical health problems with aging. Changes in sleep patterns associated with\nthe normal developmental process must be differentiated from those exceeding age-related\nchanges. Although polysomnography is of limited value in the routine evaluation of in-\nsomnia, it may be more useful in the differential diagnosis among older adults because the\netiologies of insomnia (e.g., sleep apnea) are more often identifiable in older individuals.\n366\nSleep-Wake Disorders\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each case should describe overlapping symptoms and require choosing between two similar disorders, with a contrastive justification.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Differential Diagnosis]\nNormal sleep variations.\nNormal sleep duration varies considerably across individuals.\nSome individuals who require little sleep (“short sleepers”) may be concerned about their\nsleep duration. Short sleepers differ from individuals with insomnia disorder by the lack of\ndifficulty falling or staying asleep and by the absence of characteristic daytime symptoms\n(e.g., fatigue, concentration problems, irritability). However, some short sleepers may desire\nor attempt to sleep for a longer period of time and, by prolonging time in bed, may create an\ninsomnia-like sleep pattern. Clinical insomnia also should be distinguished from normal,\nage-related sleep changes. Insomnia must also be distinguished from sleep deprivation due\nto inadequate opportunity or circumstance for sleep resulting, for example, from an emer-\ngency or from professional or family obligations forcing the individual to stay awake.\nSituational/acute insomnia.\nSituational/acute insomnia is a condition lasting a few days\nto a few weeks, often associated with life events or with changes in sleep schedules. These\nacute or short-term insomnia symptoms may also produce significant distress and inter-\nfere with social, personal, and occupational functioning. When such symptoms are fre-\nquent enough and meet all other criteria except for the 3-month duration, a diagnosis of\nother specified insomnia disorder or unspecified insomnia disorder is made.\nDelayed sleep phase and shift work types of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder.\nIndividuals with the delayed sleep phase type of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder re-\nport sleep-onset insomnia only when they try to sleep at socially normal times, but they do\nnot report difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep when their bed and rising times are\ndelayed and coincide with their endogenous circadian rhythm. Shift work type differs from\ninsomnia disorder by the history of recent shift work.\nRestless legs syndrome.\nRestless legs syndrome often produces difficulties initiating\nand maintaining sleep. However, an urge to move the legs and any accompanying unpleas-\nant leg sensations are features that differentiate this disorder from insomnia disorder.\nBreathing-related sleep disorders.\nMost individuals with a breathing-related sleep dis-\norder have a history of loud snoring, breathing pauses during sleep, and excessive daytime\nsleepiness. Nonetheless, as many as 50% of individuals with sleep apnea may also report\ninsomnia symptoms, a feature that is more common among females and older adults.\nNarcolepsy.\nNarcolepsy may cause insomnia complaints but is distinguished from in-\nsomnia disorder by the predominance of symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, cat-\naplexy, sleep paralysis, and sleep-related hallucinations.\nParasomnias.\nParasomnias are characterized by a complaint of unusual behavior or events\nduring sleep that may lead to intermittent awakenings and difficulty resuming sleep.\nHowever, it is these behavioral events, rather than the insomnia per se, that dominate the\nclinical picture.\n368\nSleep-Wake Disorders\nSubstance/medication-induced sleep disorder, insomnia type.\nSubstance/medication-\ninduced sleep disorder, insomnia type, is distinguished from insomnia disorder by the fact\nthat a substance (i.e., a drug of abuse, a medication, or exposure to a toxin) is judged to be\netiologically related to the insomnia (see “Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disor-\nder” later in this chapter). For example, insomnia occurring only in the context of heavy\ncoffee consumption would be diagnosed as caffeine-induced sleep disorder, insomnia\ntype, with onset during intoxication.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each case should highlight overlapping symptom profiles where multiple comorbid disorders are possible, and require choosing the primary diagnosis with justification.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Comorbidity]\nInsomnia is a common comorbidity of many medical conditions, including diabetes, cor-\nonary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arthritis, fibromyalgia, and\nother chronic pain conditions. The risk relationship appears to be bidirectional: insomnia\nincreases the risk of medical conditions, and medical problems increase the risk of insom-\nnia. The direction of the relationship is not always clear and may change over time; for this\nreason, comorbid insomnia is the preferred terminology in the presence of coexisting in-\nsomnia with another medical condition (or mental disorder).\nIndividuals with insomnia disorder frequently have a comorbid mental disorder, par-\nticularly bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders. Persistent insomnia represents a risk\nfactor or an early symptom of subsequent bipolar, depressive, anxiety, and substance use\ndisorders. Individuals with insomnia may misuse medications or alcohol to help with\nnighttime sleep, anxiolytics to combat tension or anxiety, and caffeine or other stimulants\nto combat excessive fatigue. In addition to worsening the insomnia, this type of substance\nuse may in some cases progress to a substance use disorder.\nRelationship to International Classification of\nSleep Disorders\nThere are several distinct insomnia phenotypes relating to the perceived source of the in-\nsomnia that are recognized by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition\n(ICSD-2). These include psychophysiological insomnia, idiopathic insomnia, sleep-state mispercep-\ntion, and inadequate sleep hygiene. Despite their clinical appeal and heuristic value, there is\nlimited evidence to support these distinct phenotypes.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

The\ndiagnosis of RLS is based primarily on patient self-report and history. Symptoms are\nworse when the individual is at rest, and frequent movements of the legs occur in an effort\nto relieve the uncomfortable sensations. Symptoms are worse in the evening or night, and\nin some individuals they occur only in the evening or night. Evening worsening occurs in-\ndependently of any differences in activity. It is important to differentiate RLS from other\nconditions such as positional discomfort and leg cramps (Criterion D).\nThe symptoms of RLS can delay sleep onset and awaken the individual from sleep and\nare associated with significant sleep fragmentation.

Unlike RLS, nocturnal leg cramps do not typically present with the desire to move\nthe limbs nor are there frequent limb movements. Less common conditions to be differen-\ntiated from RLS include neuroleptic-induced akathisia, myelopathy, symptomatic venous\ninsufficiency, peripheral artery disease, eczema, other orthopedic problems, and anxiety-\ninduced restlessness. Worsening at night and periodic limb movements are more common\nin RLS than in medication-induced akathisia or peripheral neuropathy.\nWhile is it important that RLS symptoms not be solely accounted for by another medical\nor behavioral condition, it should also be appreciated that any of these similar conditions can\noccur in an individual with RLS. This necessitates a separate focus on each possible condi-\ntion in the diagnostic process and when assessing impact. For cases in which the diagnosis of\nRLS is not certain, evaluation for the supportive features of RLS, particularly PLMS or a fam-\nily history of RLS, may be helpful.

Each must present overlapping symptoms, two possible diagnoses, and justify why one is preferred.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Features]\nIndividuals with somatic symptom disorder typically have multiple, current, somatic symp-\ntoms that are distressing or result in significant disruption of daily life (Criterion A), al-\nthough sometimes only one severe symptom, most commonly pain, is present. Symptoms\nmay be specific (e.g., localized pain) or relatively nonspecific (e.g., fatigue). The symptoms\nsometimes represent normal bodily sensations or discomfort that does not generally sig-\nnify serious disease. Somatic symptoms without an evident medical explanation are not\nsufficient to make this diagnosis. The individual’s suffering is authentic, whether or not it\nis medically explained.\nThe symptoms may or may not be associated with another medical condition. The di-\nagnoses of somatic symptom disorder and a concurrent medical illness are not mutually\nexclusive, and these frequently occur together. For example, an individual may become se-\nriously disabled by symptoms of somatic symptom disorder after an uncomplicated myo-\ncardial infarction even if the myocardial infarction itself did not result in any disability. If\nanother medical condition or high risk for developing one is present (e.g., strong family\nhistory), the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors associated with this condition are excessive\n(Criterion B).\nIndividuals with somatic symptom disorder tend to have very high levels of worry\nabout illness (Criterion B). They appraise their bodily symptoms as unduly threatening,\nharmful, or troublesome and often think the worst about their health. Even when there is\nevidence to the contrary, some patients still fear the medical seriousness of their symp-\ntoms. In severe somatic symptom disorder, health concerns may assume a central role in\nthe individual’s life, becoming a feature of his or her identity and dominating interper-\nsonal relationships.\n312\nSomatic Symptom and Related Disorders\nIndividuals typically experience distress that is principally focused on somatic symp-\ntoms and their significance. When asked directly about their distress, some individuals de-\nscribe it in relation to other aspects of their lives, while others deny any source of distress\nother than the somatic symptoms. Health-related quality of life is often impaired, both\nphysically and mentally. In severe somatic symptom disorder, the impairment is marked,\nand when persistent, the disorder can lead to invalidism.\nThere is often a high level of medical care utilization, which rarely alleviates the individ-\nual’s concerns. Consequently, the patient may seek care from multiple doctors for the same\nsymptoms. These individuals often seem unresponsive to medical interventions, and new\ninterventions may only exacerbate the presenting symptoms. Some individuals with the dis-\norder seem unusually sensitive to medication side effects. Some feel that their medical as-\nsessment and treatment have been inadequate.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

The relationship between number of somatic symptoms and\nillness worry is similar in different cultures, and marked illness worry is associated with\nimpairment and greater treatment seeking across cultures. The relationship between nu-\nmerous somatic symptoms and depression appears to be very similar around the world\nand between different cultures within one country.\nDespite these similarities, there are differences in somatic symptoms among cultures\nand ethnic groups. The description of somatic symptoms varies with linguistic and other\nlocal cultural factors. These somatic presentations have been described as “idioms of dis-\ntress” because somatic symptoms may have special meanings and shape patient-clinician\ninteractions in the particular cultural contexts. “Burnout,” the sensation of heaviness or\nthe complaints of “gas”; too much heat in the body; or burning in the head are examples of\nsymptoms that are common in some cultures or ethnic groups but rare in others. Explan-\natory models also vary, and somatic symptoms may be attributed variously to particular\nfamily, work, or environmental stresses; general medical illness; the suppression of feel-\nings of anger and resentment; or certain culture-specific phenomena, such as semen loss.\nThere may also be differences in medical treatment seeking among cultural groups, in ad-\ndition to differences due to variable access to medical care services. Seeking treatment for\nmultiple somatic symptoms in general medical clinics is a worldwide phenomenon and\noccurs at similar rates among ethnic groups in the same country.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

The symptoms of\nmany individuals with disorders like irritable bowel syndrome or fibromyalgia would not\nsatisfy the criterion necessary to diagnose somatic symptom disorder (Criterion B). Con-\nversely, the presence of somatic symptoms of an established medical disorder (e.g., diabe-\ntes or heart disease) does not exclude the diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder if the\ncriteria are otherwise met.\nPanic disorder.\nIn panic disorder, somatic symptoms and anxiety about health tend to\noccur in acute episodes, whereas in somatic symptom disorder, anxiety and somatic symp-\ntoms are more persistent.\nGeneralized anxiety disorder.\nIndividuals with generalized anxiety disorder worry about\nmultiple events, situations, or activities, only one of which may involve their health. The\nmain focus is not usually somatic symptoms or fear of illness as it is in somatic symptom\ndisorder.\nDepressive disorders.\nDepressive disorders are commonly accompanied by somatic\nsymptoms. However, depressive disorders are differentiated from somatic symptom dis-\norder by the core depressive symptoms of low (dysphoric) mood and anhedonia.\nIllness anxiety disorder.\nIf the individual has extensive worries about health but no or\nminimal somatic symptoms, it may be more appropriate to consider illness anxiety disorder.\nConversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).\nIn conversion disor-\nder, the presenting symptom is loss of function (e.g., of a limb), whereas in somatic symp-\ntom disorder, the focus is on the distress that particular symptoms cause. The features\nlisted under Criterion B of somatic symptom disorder may be helpful in differentiating the\ntwo disorders.\nDelusional disorder.\nIn somatic symptom disorder, the individual’s beliefs that somatic\nsymptoms might reflect serious underlying physical illness are not held with delusional\nintensity. Nonetheless, the individual’s beliefs concerning the somatic symptoms can be\nfirmly held. In contrast, in delusional disorder, somatic subtype, the somatic symptom be-\nliefs and behavior are stronger than those found in somatic symptom disorder.\nBody dysmorphic disorder.\nIn body dysmorphic disorder, the individual is excessively\nconcerned about, and preoccupied by, a perceived defect in his or her physical features. In\ncontrast, in somatic symptom disorder, the concern about somatic symptoms reflects fear\nof underlying illness, not of a defect in appearance.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nIn somatic symptom disorder, the recurrent ideas about\nsomatic symptoms or illness are less intrusive, and individuals with this disorder do not\nexhibit the associated repetitive behaviors aimed at reducing anxiety that occur in obses-\nsive-compulsive disorder.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Illness anxiety disorder entails a preoccupation with having or acquiring a seri-\nous, undiagnosed medical illness (Criterion A). Somatic symptoms are not present or, if\npresent, are only mild in intensity (Criterion B). A thorough evaluation fails to identify a\nserious medical condition that accounts for the individual’s concerns. While the concern\nmay be derived from a nonpathological physical sign or sensation, the individual’s dis-\ntress emanates not primarily from the physical complaint itself but rather from his or her\nanxiety about the meaning, significance, or cause of the complaint (i.e., the suspected med-\nical diagnosis). If a physical sign or symptom is present, it is often a normal physiological\nsensation (e.g., orthostatic dizziness), a benign and self-limited dysfunction (e.g., transient\ntinnitus), or a bodily discomfort not generally considered indicative of disease (e.g., belch-\ning). If a diagnosable medical condition is present, the individual’s anxiety and preoccu-\npation are clearly excessive and disproportionate to the severity of the condition (Criterion\nB). Empirical evidence and existing literature pertain to previously defined DSM hypo-\nchondriasis, and it is unclear to what extent and how precisely they apply to the descrip-\ntion of this new diagnosis.\nThe preoccupation with the idea that one is sick is accompanied by substantial anxiety\nabout health and disease (Criterion C). Individuals with illness anxiety disorder are easily\n316\nSomatic Symptom and Related Disorders\nalarmed about illness, such as by hearing about someone else falling ill or reading a health-\nrelated news story. Their concerns about undiagnosed disease do not respond to appro-\npriate medical reassurance, negative diagnostic tests, or benign course. The physician’s at-\ntempts at reassurance and symptom palliation generally do not alleviate the individual’s\nconcerns and may heighten them. Illness concerns assume a prominent place in the indi-\nvidual’s life, affecting daily activities, and may even result in invalidism. Illness becomes\na central feature of the individual’s identity and self-image, a frequent topic of social dis-\ncourse, and a characteristic response to stressful life events. Individuals with the disorder\noften examine themselves repeatedly (e.g., examining one’s throat in the mirror) (Crite-\nrion D). They research their suspected disease excessively (e.g., on the Internet) and re-\npeatedly seek reassurance from family, friends, or physicians. This incessant worrying often\nbecomes frustrating for others and may result in considerable strain within the family. In\nsome cases, the anxiety leads to maladaptive avoidance of situations (e.g., visiting sick\nfamily members) or activities (e.g., exercise) that these individuals fear might jeopardize\ntheir health.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each case should describe overlapping symptoms and require choosing between two similar disorders, with a contrastive justification.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Differential Diagnosis]\nOther medical conditions.\nThe first differential diagnostic consideration is an underly-\ning medical condition, including neurological or endocrine conditions, occult malignan-\ncies, and other diseases that affect multiple body systems. The presence of a medical\ncondition does not rule out the possibility of coexisting illness anxiety disorder. If a med-\nical condition is present, the health-related anxiety and disease concerns are clearly dis-\nproportionate to its seriousness. Transient preoccupations related to a medical condition\ndo not constitute illness anxiety disorder.\nAdjustment disorders.\nHealth-related anxiety is a normal response to serious illness\nand is not a mental disorder. Such nonpathological health anxiety is clearly related to the\nmedical condition and is typically time-limited. If the health anxiety is severe enough, an\nadjustment disorder may be diagnosed. However, only when the health anxiety is of suf-\nficient duration, severity, and distress can illness anxiety disorder be diagnosed. Thus, the\ndiagnosis requires the continuous persistence of disproportionate health-related anxiety\nfor at least 6 months.\nSomatic symptom disorder.\nSomatic symptom disorder is diagnosed when significant\nsomatic symptoms are present. In contrast, individuals with illness anxiety disorder have\nminimal somatic symptoms and are primarily concerned with the idea they are ill.\nAnxiety disorders.\nIn generalized anxiety disorder, individuals worry about multiple\nevents, situations, or activities, only one of which may involve health. In panic disorder,\nthe individual may be concerned that the panic attacks reflect the presence of a medical ill-\nness; however, although these individuals may have health anxiety, their anxiety is typi-\ncally very acute and episodic. In illness anxiety disorder, the health anxiety and fears are\nmore persistent and enduring. Individuals with illness anxiety disorder may experience\npanic attacks that are triggered by their illness concerns.\nObsessive-compulsive and related disorders.\nIndividuals with illness anxiety disor-\nder may have intrusive thoughts about having a disease and also may have associated\ncompulsive behaviors (e.g., seeking reassurance). However, in illness anxiety disorder, the\npreoccupations are usually focused on having a disease, whereas in obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder (OCD), the thoughts are intrusive and are usually focused on fears of getting a\ndisease in the future. Most individuals with OCD have obsessions or compulsions involv-\ning other concerns in addition to fears about contracting disease. In body dysmorphic dis-\n318\nSomatic Symptom and Related Disorders\norder, concerns are limited to the individual’s physical appearance, which is viewed as\ndefective or flawed.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nSome individuals with a major depressive episode rumi-\nnate about their health and worry excessively about illness. A separate diagnosis of illness\nanxiety disorder is not made if these concerns occur only during major depressive epi-\nsodes. However, if excessive illness worry persists after remission of an episode of major\ndepressive disorder, the diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder should be considered.\nPsychotic disorders.\nIndividuals with illness anxiety disorder are not delusional and\ncan acknowledge the possibility that the feared disease is not present. Their ideas do not\nattain the rigidity and intensity seen in the somatic delusions occurring in psychotic dis-\norders (e.g., schizophrenia; delusional disorder, somatic type; major depressive disorder,\nwith psychotic features). True somatic delusions are generally more bizarre (e.g., that an\norgan is rotting or dead) than the concerns seen in illness anxiety disorder. The concerns\nseen in illness anxiety disorder, though not founded in reality, are plausible.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each must present overlapping symptoms, two possible diagnoses, and justify why one is preferred.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Features]\nMany clinicians use the alternative names of “functional” (referring to abnormal central\nnervous system functioning) or “psychogenic” (referring to an assumed etiology) to de-\nscribe the symptoms of conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disor-\nder). In conversion disorder, there may be one or more symptoms of various types. Motor\nsymptoms include weakness or paralysis; abnormal movements, such as tremor or dys-\ntonic movements; gait abnormalities; and abnormal limb posturing. Sensory symptoms\ninclude altered, reduced, or absent skin sensation, vision, or hearing. Episodes of abnor-\nmal generalized limb shaking with apparent impaired or loss of consciousness may resem-\nble epileptic seizures (also called psychogenic or non-epileptic seizures). There may be\nepisodes of unresponsiveness resembling syncope or coma. Other symptoms include re-\nduced or absent speech volume (dysphonia/aphonia), altered articulation (dysarthria), a\nsensation of a lump in the throat (globus), and diplopia.\nAlthough the diagnosis requires that the symptom is not explained by neurological\ndisease, it should not be made simply because results from investigations are normal or\nbecause the symptom is “bizarre.” There must be clinical findings that show clear evidence\nof incompatibility with neurological disease. Internal inconsistency at examination is one\nway to demonstrate incompatibility (i.e., demonstrating that physical signs elicited\nthrough one examination method are no longer positive when tested a different way). Ex-\namples of such examination findings include\n• Hoover’s sign, in which weakness of hip extension returns to normal strength with con-\ntralateral hip flexion against resistance.\n• Marked weakness of ankle plantar-flexion when tested on the bed in an individual who\nis able to walk on tiptoes;\n• Positive findings on the tremor entrainment test. On this test, a unilateral tremor may\nbe identified as functional if the tremor changes when the individual is distracted away\nfrom it. This may be observed if the individual is asked to copy the examiner in making\na rhythmical movement with their unaffected hand and this causes the functional\ntremor to change such that it copies or “entrains” to the rhythm of the unaffected hand\nor the functional tremor is suppressed, or no longer makes a simple rhythmical move-\nment.\n• In attacks resembling epilepsy or syncope (“psychogenic” non-epileptic attacks), the\noccurrence of closed eyes with resistance to opening or a normal simultaneous electro-\nencephalogram (although this alone does not exclude all forms of epilepsy or syncope).\n• For visual symptoms, a tubular visual field (i.e., tunnel vision).\nIt is important to note that the diagnosis of conversion disorder should be based on the\noverall clinical picture and not on a single clinical finding.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each case should describe overlapping symptoms and require choosing between two similar disorders, with a contrastive justification.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Differential Diagnosis]\nIf another mental disorder better explains the symptoms, that diagnosis should be made.\nHowever the diagnosis of conversion disorder may be made in the presence of another\nmental disorder.\nNeurological disease.\nThe main differential diagnosis is neurological disease that might\nbetter explain the symptoms. After a thorough neurological assessment, an unexpected\nneurological disease cause for the symptoms is rarely found at follow up. However, reas-\nsessment may be required if the symptoms appear to be progressive. Conversion disorder\nmay coexist with neurological disease.\nSomatic symptom disorder.\nConversion disorder may be diagnosed in addition to so-\nmatic symptom disorder. Most of the somatic symptoms encountered in somatic symptom\ndisorder cannot be demonstrated to be clearly incompatible with pathophysiology (e.g.,\npain, fatigue), whereas in conversion disorder, such incompatibility is required for the di-\nagnosis. The excessive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors characterizing somatic symptom\ndisorder are often absent in conversion disorder.\nFactitious disorder and malingering.\nThe diagnosis of conversion disorder does not re-\nquire the judgment that the symptoms are not intentionally produced (i.e., not feigned),\nbecause assessment of conscious intention is unreliable. However definite evidence of\nfeigning (e.g., clear evidence that loss of function is present during the examination but not\nat home) would suggest a diagnosis of factitious disorder if the individual’s apparent aim\nis to assume the sick role or malingering if the aim is to obtain an incentive such as money.\nDissociative disorders.\nDissociative symptoms are common in individuals with con-\nversion disorder. If both conversion disorder and a dissociative disorder are present, both\ndiagnoses should be made.\nBody dysmorphic disorder.\nIndividuals with body dysmorphic disorder are exces-\nsively concerned about a perceived defect in their physical features but do not complain of\nsymptoms of sensory or motor functioning in the affected body part.\nDepressive disorders.\nIn depressive disorders, individuals may report general heavi-\nness of their limbs, whereas the weakness of conversion disorder is more focal and prom-\ninent. Depressive disorders are also differentiated by the presence of core depressive\nsymptoms.\nPanic disorder.\nEpisodic neurological symptoms (e.g., tremors and paresthesias) can\noccur in both conversion disorder and panic attacks. In panic attacks, the neurological\nsymptoms are typically transient and acutely episodic with characteristic cardiorespira-\ntory symptoms. Loss of awareness with amnesia for the attack and violent limb move-\nments occur in non-epileptic attacks, but not in panic attacks.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

The withdrawal syn-\ndrome includes two or more of the symptoms reflecting autonomic hyperactivity and\nanxiety listed in Criterion B, along with gastrointestinal symptoms.\nWithdrawal symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-\ncupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C). The symptoms must not\nbe attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another men-\ntal disorder (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder), including intoxication or withdrawal\nfrom another substance (e.g., sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal) (Criterion D).\nSymptoms can be relieved by administering alcohol or benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam).\nThe withdrawal symptoms typically begin when blood concentrations of alcohol decline\nsharply (i.e., within 4–12 hours) after alcohol use has been stopped or reduced. Reflecting the\nrelatively fast metabolism of alcohol, symptoms of alcohol withdrawal usually peak in inten-\nsity during the second day of abstinence and are likely to improve markedly by the fourth or\nfifth day. Following acute withdrawal, however, symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, and auto-\nnomic dysfunction may persist for up to 3–6 months at lower levels of intensity.\nFewer than 10% of individuals who develop alcohol withdrawal will ever develop dra-\nmatic symptoms (e.g., severe autonomic hyperactivity, tremors, alcohol withdrawal delir-\nium).

Independent schizophrenia, major depressive disor-\nder, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders, such as panic disorder, are likely to be asso-\nciated with much longer-lasting periods of symptoms and often require longer-term\nmedications to optimize the probability of improvement or recovery. The alcohol-induced\nconditions, on the other hand, are likely to be much shorter in duration and disappear\nwithin several days to 1 month after cessation of severe intoxication and/or withdrawal,\neven without psychotropic medications.\nThe importance of recognizing an alcohol-induced disorder is similar to the relevance\nof identifying the possible role of some endocrine conditions and medication reactions be-\nfore diagnosing an independent mental disorder.

For alcohol\nintoxication delirium and alcohol withdrawal delirium, see the criteria and discussion of de-\nlirium in the chapter “Neurocognitive Disorders.” These alcohol-induced disorders are diag-\nnosed instead of alcohol intoxication or alcohol withdrawal only when the symptoms are\nsufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.\nFeatures\nThe symptom profiles for an alcohol-induced condition resemble independent mental disor-\nders as described elsewhere in DSM-5. However, the alcohol-induced disorder is temporary\nand observed after severe intoxication with and/or withdrawal from alcohol. While the symp-\ntoms can be identical to those of independent mental disorders (e.g., psychoses, major depres-\nsive disorder), and while they can have the same severe consequences (e.g., suicide attempts),\nalcohol-induced conditions are likely to improve without formal treatment in a matter of days\nto weeks after cessation of severe intoxication and/or withdrawal.\nEach alcohol-induced mental disorder is listed in the relevant diagnostic section and there-\nfore only a brief description is offered here. Alcohol-induced disorders must have developed\nin the context of severe intoxication and/or withdrawal from the substance capable of produc-\ning the mental disorder. In addition, there must be evidence that the disorder being observed\nis not likely to be better explained by another non-alcohol-induced mental disorder. The latter\nis likely to occur if the mental disorder was present before the severe intoxication or with-\ndrawal, or continued more than 1 month after the cessation of severe intoxication and/or with-\ndrawal. When symptoms are observed only during a delirium, they should be considered part\nof the delirium and not diagnosed separately, as many symptoms (including disturbances in\nmood, anxiety, and reality testing) are commonly seen during agitated, confused states. The al-\ncohol-induced disorder must be clinically relevant, causing significant levels of distress or sig-\nnificant functional impairment. Finally, there are indications that the intake of substances of\nabuse in the context of a preexisting mental disorder are likely to result in an intensification of\nthe preexisting independent syndrome.\nThe features associated with each relevant major mental disorder (e.g., psychotic epi-\nsodes, major depressive disorder) are similar whether observed with an independent or an\nalcohol-induced condition. However, individuals with alcohol-induced disorders are\nlikely to also demonstrate the associated features seen with an alcohol use disorder, as\nlisted in the subsections of this chapter.\nRates of alcohol-induced disorders vary somewhat by diagnostic category. For exam-\nple, the lifetime risk for major depressive episodes in individuals with alcohol use disorder\nis approximately 40%, but only about one-third to one-half of these represent independent\nmajor depressive syndromes observed outside the context of intoxication. Similar rates of\nalcohol-induced sleep and anxiety conditions are likely, but alcohol-induced psychotic ep-\nisodes are fairly rare.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each must present overlapping symptoms, two possible diagnoses, and justify why one is preferred.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Features]\nCannabis use disorder and the other cannabis-related disorders include problems that are\nassociated with substances derived from the cannabis plant and chemically similar syn-\nthetic compounds. Over time, this plant material has accumulated many names (e.g.,\nweed, pot, herb, grass, reefer, mary jane, dagga, dope, bhang, skunk, boom, gangster, kif,\nand ganja). A concentrated extraction of the cannabis plant that is also commonly used is\nhashish. Cannabis is the generic and perhaps the most appropriate scientific term for the\npsychoactive substance(s) derived from the plant, and as such it is used in this manual\nto refer to all forms of cannabis-like substances, including synthetic cannabinoid com-\npounds.\nCannabis Use Disorder\n511\nSynthetic oral formulations (pill/capsules) of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-\nTHC) are available by prescription for a number of approved medical indications (e.g., for\nnausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy; for anorexia and weight loss in individuals\nwith AIDS). Other synthetic cannabinoid compounds have been manufactured and dis-\ntributed for nonmedical use in the form of plant material that has been sprayed with a can-\nnabinoid formulation (e.g., K2, Spice, JWH-018, JWH-073).\nThe cannabinoids have diverse effects in the brain, prominent among which are actions\non CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the central nervous sys-\ntem. Endogenous ligands for these receptors behave essentially like neurotransmitters.\nThe potency of cannabis (delta-9-THC concentration) that is generally available varies\ngreatly, ranging from 1% to approximately 15% in typical cannabis plant material and\n10%–20% in hashish. During the past two decades, a steady increase in the potency of\nseized cannabis has been observed.\nCannabis is most commonly smoked via a variety of methods: pipes, water pipes\n(bongs or hookahs), cigarettes (joints or reefers), or, most recently, in the paper from hol-\nlowed out cigars (blunts). Cannabis is also sometimes ingested orally, typically by mixing\nit into food. More recently, devices have been developed in which cannabis is “vapor-\nized.” Vaporization involves heating the plant material to release psychoactive cannabi-\nnoids for inhalation. As with other psychoactive substances, smoking (and vaporization)\ntypically produces more rapid onset and more intense experiences of the desired effects.\nIndividuals who regularly use cannabis can develop all the general diagnostic features\nof a substance use disorder. Cannabis use disorder is commonly observed as the only sub-\nstance use disorder experienced by the individual; however, it also frequently occurs con-\ncurrently with other types of substance use disorders (i.e., alcohol, cocaine, opioid). In\ncases for which multiple types of substances are used, many times the individual may\nminimize the symptoms related to cannabis, as the symptoms may be less severe or cause\nless harm than those directly related to the use of the other substances. Pharmacological\nand behavioral tolerance to most of the effects of cannabis has been reported in individuals\nwho use cannabis persistently. Generally, tolerance is lost when cannabis use is discontin-\nued for a significant period of time (i.e., for at least several months).\nNew to DSM-5 is the recognition that abrupt cessation of daily or near-daily cannabis\nuse often results in the onset of a cannabis withdrawal syndrome. Common symptoms of\nwithdrawal include irritability, anger or aggression, anxiety, depressed mood, restless-\nness, sleep difficulty, and decreased appetite or weight loss. Although typically not as\nsevere as alcohol or opiate withdrawal, the cannabis withdrawal syndrome can cause sig-\nnificant distress and contribute to difficulty quitting or relapse among those trying to\nabstain.\nIndividuals with cannabis use disorder may use cannabis throughout the day over a\nperiod of months or years, and thus may spend many hours a day under the influence.\nOthers may use less frequently, but their use causes recurrent problems related to family,\nschool, work, or other important activities (e.g., repeated absences at work; neglect of fam-\nily obligations). Periodic cannabis use and intoxication can negatively affect behavioral\nand cognitive functioning and thus interfere with optimal performance at work or school,\nor place the individual at increased physical risk when performing activities that could be\nphysically hazardous (e.g., driving a car; playing certain sports; performing manual work\nactivities, including operating machinery). Arguments with spouses or parents over the\nuse of cannabis in the home, or its use in the presence of children, can adversely impact\nfamily functioning and are common features of those with cannabis use disorder. Last, in-\ndividuals with cannabis use disorder may continue using despite knowledge of physical\nproblems (e.g., chronic cough related to smoking) or psychological problems (e.g., exces-\nsive sedation or exacerbation of other mental health problems) associated with its use.\nWhether or not cannabis is being used for legitimate medical reasons may also affect\ndiagnosis. When a substance is taken as indicated for a medical condition, symptoms of\n512\nSubstance-Related and Addictive Disorders\ntolerance and withdrawal will naturally occur and should not be used as the primary cri-\nteria for determining a diagnosis of a substance use disorder. Although medical uses of\ncannabis remain controversial and equivocal, use for medical circumstances should be\nconsidered when a diagnosis is being made.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each should present a timeline of symptoms that could fit two disorders, and require contrastive reasoning based on onset, progression, or duration.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Development Course]\nThe onset of cannabis use disorder can occur at any time during or following adolescence,\nbut onset is most commonly during adolescence or young adulthood. Although much less\nfrequent, onset of cannabis use disorder in the preteen years or in the late 20s or older can\noccur. Recent acceptance by some of the use and availability of “medical marijuana” may\nincrease the rate of onset of cannabis use disorder among older adults.\nGenerally, cannabis use disorder develops over an extended period of time, although\nthe progression appears to be more rapid in adolescents, particularly those with pervasive\nconduct problems. Most people who develop a cannabis use disorder typically establish a\npattern of cannabis use that gradually increases in both frequency and amount. Cannabis,\nalong with tobacco and alcohol, is traditionally the first substance that adolescents try.\nMany perceive cannabis use as less harmful than alcohol or tobacco use, and this percep-\ntion likely contributes to increased use. Moreover, cannabis intoxication does not typically\nresult in as severe behavioral and cognitive dysfunction as does significant alcohol intox-\nication, which may increase the probability of more frequent use in more diverse situa-\ntions than with alcohol. These factors likely contribute to the potential rapid transition\nfrom cannabis use to a cannabis use disorder among some adolescents and the common\npattern of using throughout the day that is commonly observed among those with more\nsevere cannabis use disorder.\nCannabis use disorder among preteens, adolescents, and young adults is typically ex-\npressed as excessive use with peers that is a component of a pattern of other delinquent\nbehaviors usually associated with conduct problems. Milder cases primarily reflect con-\ntinued use despite clear problems related to disapproval of use by other peers, school ad-\nministration, or family, which also places the youth at risk for physical or behavioral\nconsequences. In more severe cases, there is a progression to using alone or using through-\nout the day such that use interferes with daily functioning and takes the place of previ-\nously established, prosocial activities.\nWith adolescent users, changes in mood stability, energy level, and eating patterns are\ncommonly observed. These signs and symptoms are likely due to the direct effects of can-\nnabis use (intoxication) and the subsequent effects following acute intoxication (coming\ndown), as well as attempts to conceal use from others. School-related problems are com-\nmonly associated with cannabis use disorder in adolescents, particularly a dramatic drop\nin grades, truancy, and reduced interest in general school activities and outcomes.\nCannabis use disorder among adults typically involves well-established patterns of daily\ncannabis use that continue despite clear psychosocial or medical problems. Many adults have\nexperienced repeated desire to stop or have failed at repeated cessation attempts. Milder adult\ncases may resemble the more common adolescent cases in that cannabis use is not as frequent\nor heavy but continues despite potential significant consequences of sustained use. The rate of\nuse among middle-age and older adults appears to be increasing, likely because of a cohort ef-\nfect resulting from high prevalence of use in the late 1960s and the 1970s.\nEarly onset of cannabis use (e.g., prior to age 15 years) is a robust predictor of the de-\nvelopment of cannabis use disorder and other types of substance use disorders and mental\ndisorders during young adulthood. Such early onset is likely related to concurrent other\nexternalizing problems, most notably conduct disorder symptoms. However, early onset\nis also a predictor of internalizing problems and as such probably reflects a general risk\nfactor for the development of mental health disorders.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Can-\nnabis use and cannabis use disorder are highly comorbid with other substance use disor-\nders. Co-occurring mental conditions are common in cannabis use disorder. Cannabis use\nhas been associated with poorer life satisfaction; increased mental health treatment and\nhospitalization; and higher rates of depression, anxiety disorders, suicide attempts, and\nconduct disorder. Individuals with past-year or lifetime cannabis use disorder have high\nrates of alcohol use disorder (greater than 50%) and tobacco use disorder (53%). Rates of\nother substance use disorders are also likely to be high among individuals with cannabis\nuse disorder. Among those seeking treatment for a cannabis use disorder, 74% report\nproblematic use of a secondary or tertiary substance: alcohol (40%), cocaine (12%), meth-\namphetamine (6%), and heroin or other opiates (2%). Among those younger than 18 years,\n61% reported problematic use of a secondary substance: alcohol (48%), cocaine (4%), meth-\namphetamine (2%), and heroin or other opiates (2%). Cannabis use disorder is also often\nobserved as a secondary problem among those with a primary diagnosis of other substance\nuse disorders, with approximately 25%–80% of those in treatment for another substance\nuse disorder reporting use of cannabis.\nIndividuals with past-year or lifetime diagnoses of cannabis use disorder also have\nhigh rates of concurrent mental disorders other than substance use disorders. Major de-\npressive disorder (11%), any anxiety disorder (24%), and bipolar I disorder (13%) are quite\ncommon among individuals with a past-year diagnosis of a cannabis use disorder, as are\nantisocial (30%), obsessive-compulsive, (19%), and paranoid (18%) personality disorders.\nApproximately 33% of adolescents with cannabis use disorder have internalizing disor-\nders (e.g., anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder), and 60% have externalizing\ndisorders (e.g., conduct disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder).\nAlthough cannabis use can impact multiple aspects of normal human functioning, in-\ncluding the cardiovascular, immune, neuromuscular, ocular, reproductive, and respira-\ntory systems, as well as appetite and cognition/perception, there are few clear medical\nconditions that commonly co-occur with cannabis use disorder.

Each should plausibly match two disorders, requiring a contrastive explanation to select the better fitting one.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Criteria]\nA. A problematic pattern of opioid use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress,\nas manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month period:\n1. Opioids are often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was in-\ntended.\n2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control opioid use.\n3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the opioid, use the opi-\noid, or recover from its effects.\n4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use opioids.\n5. Recurrent opioid use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work,\nschool, or home.\n6. Continued opioid use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal\nproblems caused or exacerbated by the effects of opioids.\n7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced be-\ncause of opioid use.\n8. Recurrent opioid use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.\n9. Continued opioid use despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physi-\ncal or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by\nthe substance.\n10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:\na. A need for markedly increased amounts of opioids to achieve intoxication or de-\nsired effect.\nb. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of an opioid.\nNote: This criterion is not considered to be met for those taking opioids solely under\nappropriate medical supervision.\n11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:\na. The characteristic opioid withdrawal syndrome (refer to Criteria A and B of the\ncriteria set for opioid withdrawal, pp. 547–548).\nb. Opioids (or a closely related substance) are taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal\nsymptoms.\nNote: This criterion is not considered to be met for those individuals taking opioids\nsolely under appropriate medical supervision.\nSpecify if:\nIn early remission: After full criteria for opioid use disorder were previously met, none\nof the criteria for opioid use disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less\nthan 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or\nurge to use opioids,” may be met).\nIn sustained remission: After full criteria for opioid use disorder were previously met,\nnone of the criteria for opioid use disorder have been met at any time during a period\nof 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong de-\nsire or urge to use opioids,” may be met).\nSpecify if:\nOn maintenance therapy: This additional specifier is used if the individual is taking a\nprescribed agonist medication such as methadone or buprenorphine and none of the\ncriteria for opioid use disorder have been met for that class of medication (except tol-\nerance to, or withdrawal from, the agonist). This category also applies to those individ-\n542\nSubstance-Related and Addictive Disorders\nuals being maintained on a partial agonist, an agonist/antagonist, or a full antagonist\nsuch as oral naltrexone or depot naltrexone.\nIn a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if the individual is in an\nenvironment where access to opioids is restricted.\nCoding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an opioid intoxication,\nopioid withdrawal, or another opioid-induced mental disorder is also present, do not use\nthe codes below for opioid use disorder. Instead, the comorbid opioid use disorder is indi-\ncated in the 4th character of the opioid-induced disorder code (see the coding note for opi-\noid intoxication, opioid withdrawal, or a specific opioid-induced mental disorder).

(For example, an indi-\nvidual prescribed analgesic opioids for pain relief at adequate dosing will use significantly\nmore than prescribed and not only because of persistent pain.) Individuals with opioid use\ndisorder tend to develop such regular patterns of compulsive drug use that daily activities\nare planned around obtaining and administering opioids. Opioids are usually purchased\non the illegal market but may also be obtained from physicians by falsifying or exagger-\nating general medical problems or by receiving simultaneous prescriptions from several\nphysicians. Health care professionals with opioid use disorder will often obtain opioids by\nwriting prescriptions for themselves or by diverting opioids that have been prescribed for\npatients or from pharmacy supplies. Most individuals with opioid use disorder have\nsignificant levels of tolerance and will experience withdrawal on abrupt discontinuation\nof opioid substances. Individuals with opioid use disorder often develop conditioned\nresponses to drug-related stimuli (e.g., craving on seeing any heroin powder–like sub-\nstance)—a phenomenon that occurs with most drugs that cause intense psychological\nchanges.

Each case should describe overlapping symptoms and require choosing between two similar disorders, with a contrastive justification.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Differential Diagnosis]\nOpioid-induced mental disorders.\nOpioid-induced disorders occur frequently in individ-\nuals with opioid use disorder. Opioid-induced disorders may be characterized by symptoms\n(e.g., depressed mood) that resemble primary mental disorders (e.g., persistent depressive dis-\norder [dysthymia] vs. opioid-induced depressive disorder, with depressive features, with on-\nset during intoxication). Opioids are less likely to produce symptoms of mental disturbance\nthan are most other drugs of abuse. Opioid intoxication and opioid withdrawal are distin-\nguished from the other opioid-induced disorders (e.g., opioid-induced depressive disorder,\nwith onset during intoxication) because the symptoms in these latter disorders predominate\nthe clinical presentation and are severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention.\nOther substance intoxication.\nAlcohol intoxication and sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic\nintoxication can cause a clinical picture that resembles that for opioid intoxication. A diag-\nnosis of alcohol or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication can usually be made based\non the absence of pupillary constriction or the lack of a response to naloxone challenge. In\nsome cases, intoxication may be due both to opioids and to alcohol or other sedatives. In\nthese cases, the naloxone challenge will not reverse all of the sedative effects.\nOther withdrawal disorders.\nThe anxiety and restlessness associated with opioid with-\ndrawal resemble symptoms seen in sedative-hypnotic withdrawal. However, opioid\nwithdrawal is also accompanied by rhinorrhea, lacrimation, and pupillary dilation, which\n546\nSubstance-Related and Addictive Disorders\nare not seen in sedative-type withdrawal. Dilated pupils are also seen in hallucinogen\nintoxication and stimulant intoxication.

A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the stimulant, use the\nstimulant, or recover from its effects.\n4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the stimulant.\n5. Recurrent stimulant use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work,\nschool, or home.\n6. Continued stimulant use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interper-\nsonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the stimulant.\n7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced be-\ncause of stimulant use.\n8. Recurrent stimulant use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.\n9. Stimulant use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent\nphysical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated\nby the stimulant.\n10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:\na. A need for markedly increased amounts of the stimulant to achieve intoxication\nor desired effect.\nb. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the\nstimulant.\nNote: This criterion is not considered to be met for those taking stimulant medica-\ntions solely under appropriate medical supervision, such as medications for atten-\ntion-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or narcolepsy.\n11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:\na. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the stimulant (refer to Criteria A and\nB of the criteria set for stimulant withdrawal, p. 569).\nb. The stimulant (or a closely related substance) is taken to relieve or avoid with-\ndrawal symptoms.\n562\nSubstance-Related and Addictive Disorders\nNote: This criterion is not considered to be met for those taking stimulant medica-\ntions solely under appropriate medical supervision, such as medications for atten-\ntion-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or narcolepsy.\nSpecify if:\nIn early remission: After full criteria for stimulant use disorder were previously met,\nnone of the criteria for stimulant use disorder have been met for at least 3 months but\nfor less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong de-\nsire or urge to use the stimulant,” may be met).\nIn sustained remission: After full criteria for stimulant use disorder were previously\nmet, none of the criteria for stimulant use disorder have been met at any time during a\nperiod of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a\nstrong desire or urge to use the stimulant,” may be met).\nSpecify if:\nIn a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if the individual is in an\nenvironment where access to stimulants is restricted.\nCoding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an amphetamine in-\ntoxication, amphetamine withdrawal, or another amphetamine-induced mental disorder is\nalso present, do not use the codes below for amphetamine use disorder.

Each must present overlapping symptoms, two possible diagnoses, and justify why one is preferred.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Features]\nThe amphetamine and amphetamine-type stimulants include substances with a substi-\ntuted-phenylethylamine structure, such as amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, and meth-\namphetamine. Also included are those substances that are structurally different but have\nsimilar effects, such as methylphenidate. These substances are usually taken orally or in-\ntravenously, although methamphetamine is also taken by the nasal route. In addition to\nthe synthetic amphetamine-type compounds, there are naturally occurring, plant-derived\nstimulants such as khât. Amphetamines and other stimulants may be obtained by prescrip-\ntion for the treatment of obesity, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and narcolepsy.\nConsequently, prescribed stimulants may be diverted into the illegal market. The effects of\namphetamines and amphetamine-like drugs are similar to those of cocaine, such that the\ncriteria for stimulant use disorder are presented here as a single disorder with the ability to\nspecify the particular stimulant used by the individual. Cocaine may be consumed in sev-\neral preparations (e.g., coca leaves, coca paste, cocaine hydrochloride, and cocaine alka-\nloids such as freebase and crack) that differ in potency because of varying levels of purity\nand speed of onset. However, in all forms of the substance, cocaine is the active ingredient.\nCocaine hydrochloride powder is usually “snorted” through the nostrils or dissolved in\nwater and injected intravenously.\nIndividuals exposed to amphetamine-type stimulants or cocaine can develop stimu-\nlant use disorder as rapidly as 1 week, although the onset is not always this rapid. Re-\ngardless of the route of administration, tolerance occurs with repeated use. Withdrawal\nsymptoms, particularly hypersomnia, increased appetite, and dysphoria, can occur and\ncan enhance craving. Most individuals with stimulant use disorder have experienced tol-\nerance or withdrawal.\nUse patterns and course are similar for disorders involving amphetamine-type stimu-\nlants and cocaine, as both substances are potent central nervous system stimulants with\nsimilar psychoactive and sympathomimetic effects. Amphetamine-type stimulants are\nlonger acting than cocaine and thus are used fewer times per day. Usage may be chronic or\nepisodic, with binges punctuated by brief non-use periods. Aggressive or violent behavior\nis common when high doses are smoked, ingested, or administered intravenously. Intense\ntemporary anxiety resembling panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder, as well as\nparanoid ideation and psychotic episodes that resemble schizophrenia, is seen with high-\ndose use.\nWithdrawal states are associated with temporary but intense depressive symptoms that\ncan resemble a major depressive episode; the depressive symptoms usually resolve within\n1 week. Tolerance to amphetamine-type stimulants develops and leads to escalation of the\ndose. Conversely, some users of amphetamine-type stimulants develop sensitization,\ncharacterized by enhanced effects.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

First regular use\nStimulant Use Disorder\n565\namong individuals in treatment occurs, on average, at approximately age 23 years. For pri-\nmary methamphetamine–primary treatment admissions, the average age is 31 years.\nSome individuals begin stimulant use to control weight or to improve performance in\nschool, work, or athletics. This includes obtaining medications such as methylphenidate or\namphetamine salts prescribed to others for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperac-\ntivity disorder. Stimulant use disorder can develop rapidly with intravenous or smoked\nadministration; among primary admissions for amphetamine-type stimulant use, 66% re-\nported smoking, 18% reported injecting, and 10% reported snorting.\nPatterns of stimulant administration include episodic or daily (or almost daily) use.\nEpisodic use tends to be separated by 2 or more days of non-use (e.g., intense use over a\nweekend or on one or more weekdays). “Binges” involve continuous high-dose use over\nhours or days and are often associated with physical dependence. Binges usually termi-\nnate only when stimulant supplies are depleted or exhaustion ensues. Chronic daily use\nmay involve high or low doses, often with an increase in dose over time.\nStimulant smoking and intravenous use are associated with rapid progression to se-\nvere-level stimulant use disorder, often occurring over weeks to months. Intranasal use of\ncocaine and oral use of amphetamine-type stimulants result in more gradual progression\noccurring over months to years.

Require the model to choose which disorder is the better match based on the type and severity of impairment.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Functional Consequences]\nVarious medical conditions may occur depending on the route of administration. Intrana-\nsal users often develop sinusitis, irritation, bleeding of the nasal mucosa, and a perforated\nnasal septum. Individuals who smoke the drugs are at increased risk for respiratory prob-\nlems (e.g., coughing, bronchitis, and pneumonitis). Injectors have puncture marks and\n“tracks,” most commonly on their forearms. Risk of HIV infection increases with frequent\nintravenous injections and unsafe sexual activity. Other sexually transmitted diseases,\nhepatitis, and tuberculosis and other lung infections are also seen. Weight loss and mal-\nnutrition are common.\nChest pain may be a common symptom during stimulant intoxication. Myocardial in-\nfarction, palpitations and arrhythmias, sudden death from respiratory or cardiac arrest,\nand stroke have been associated with stimulant use among young and otherwise healthy\nindividuals. Seizures can occur with stimulant use. Pneumothorax can result from per-\nforming Valsalva-like maneuvers done to better absorb inhaled smoke. Traumatic injuries\ndue to violent behavior are common among individuals trafficking drugs. Cocaine use is\nassociated with irregularities in placental blood flow, abruptio placentae, premature labor\nand delivery, and an increased prevalence of infants with very low birth weights.\nIndividuals with stimulant use disorder may become involved in theft, prostitution, or\ndrug dealing in order to acquire drugs or money for drugs.\nNeurocognitive impairment is common among methamphetamine users. Oral health\nproblems include “meth mouth” with gum disease, tooth decay, and mouth sores related\nto the toxic effects of smoking the drug and to bruxism while intoxicated. Adverse pulmo-\nnary effects appear to be less common for amphetamine-type stimulants because they are\nsmoked fewer times per day. Emergency department visits are common for stimulant-re-\nlated mental disorder symptoms, injury, skin infections, and dental pathology.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each must present overlapping symptoms, two possible diagnoses, and justify why one is preferred.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Features]\nThe essential feature of stimulant intoxication, related to amphetamine-type stimulants\nand cocaine, is the presence of clinically significant behavioral or psychological changes\nthat develop during, or shortly after, use of stimulants (Criteria A and B). Auditory hallu-\ncinations may be prominent, as may paranoid ideation, and these symptoms must be dis-\ntinguished from an independent psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia. Stimulant\nintoxication usually begins with a “high” feeling and includes one or more of the follow-\ning: euphoria with enhanced vigor, gregariousness, hyperactivity, restlessness, hypervig-\nilance, interpersonal sensitivity, talkativeness, anxiety, tension, alertness, grandiosity,\nstereotyped and repetitive behavior, anger, impaired judgment, and, in the case of chronic\nintoxication, affective blunting with fatigue or sadness and social withdrawal. These be-\nhavioral and psychological changes are accompanied by two or more of the following\nsigns and symptoms that develop during or shortly after stimulant use: tachycardia or bra-\ndycardia; pupillary dilation; elevated or lowered blood pressure; perspiration or chills;\nnausea or vomiting; evidence of weight loss; psychomotor agitation or retardation; mus-\ncular weakness, respiratory depression, chest pain, or cardiac arrhythmias; and confu-\nsion, seizures, dyskinesias, dystonias, or coma (Criterion C). Intoxication, either acute or\nchronic, is often associated with impaired social or occupational functioning. Severe in-\ntoxication can lead to convulsions, cardiac arrhythmias, hyperpyrexia, and death. For the\ndiagnosis of stimulant intoxication to be made, the symptoms must not be attributable\nto another medical condition and not better explained by another mental disorder (Crite-\nrion D). While stimulant intoxication occurs in individuals with stimulant use disorders, in-\ntoxication is not a criterion for stimulant use disorder, which is confirmed by the presence\nof two of the 11 diagnostic criteria for use disorder.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each must present overlapping symptoms, two possible diagnoses, and justify why one is preferred.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Features]\nThe essential feature of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the development of char-\nacteristic symptoms following exposure to one or more traumatic events. Emotional re-\nactions to the traumatic event (e.g., fear, helplessness, horror) are no longer a part of\nCriterion A. The clinical presentation of PTSD varies. In some individuals, fear-based re-\nexperiencing, emotional, and behavioral symptoms may predominate. In others, anhe-\ndonic or dysphoric mood states and negative cognitions may be most distressing. In some\nother individuals, arousal and reactive-externalizing symptoms are prominent, while in\nothers, dissociative symptoms predominate. Finally, some individuals exhibit combina-\ntions of these symptom patterns.\nThe directly experienced traumatic events in Criterion A include, but are not limited\nto, exposure to war as a combatant or civilian, threatened or actual physical assault (e.g.,\nphysical attack, robbery, mugging, childhood physical abuse), threatened or actual sexual\nviolence (e.g., forced sexual penetration, alcohol/drug-facilitated sexual penetration, abu-\nsive sexual contact, noncontact sexual abuse, sexual trafficking), being kidnapped, being\ntaken hostage, terrorist attack, torture, incarceration as a prisoner of war, natural or hu-\nman-made disasters, and severe motor vehicle accidents. For children, sexually violent\nevents may include developmentally inappropriate sexual experiences without physical\nviolence or injury. A life-threatening illness or debilitating medical condition is not neces-\nsarily considered a traumatic event. Medical incidents that qualify as traumatic events in-\nvolve sudden, catastrophic events (e.g., waking during surgery, anaphylactic shock).\nWitnessed events include, but are not limited to, observing threatened or serious injury,\nunnatural death, physical or sexual abuse of another person due to violent assault, domes-\ntic violence, accident, war or disaster, or a medical catastrophe in one’s child (e.g., a life-\nthreatening hemorrhage). Indirect exposure through learning about an event is limited to\nexperiences affecting close relatives or friends and experiences that are violent or acciden-\ntal (e.g., death due to natural causes does not qualify). Such events include violent per-\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder\n275\nsonal assault, suicide, serious accident, and serious injury. The disorder may be especially\nsevere or long-lasting when the stressor is interpersonal and intentional (e.g., torture, sex-\nual violence).\nThe traumatic event can be reexperienced in various ways. Commonly, the individual\nhas recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive recollections of the event (Criterion B1). Intrusive\nrecollections in PTSD are distinguished from depressive rumination in that they apply\nonly to involuntary and intrusive distressing memories. The emphasis is on recurrent\nmemories of the event that usually include sensory, emotional, or physiological behavioral\ncomponents. A common reexperiencing symptom is distressing dreams that replay the\nevent itself or that are representative or thematically related to the major threats involved\nin the traumatic event (Criterion B2). The individual may experience dissociative states\nthat last from a few seconds to several hours or even days, during which components of\nthe event are relived and the individual behaves as if the event were occurring at that mo-\nment (Criterion B3). Such events occur on a continuum from brief visual or other sensory\nintrusions about part of the traumatic event without loss of reality orientation, to complete\nloss of awareness of present surroundings. These episodes, often referred to as “flash-\nbacks,” are typically brief but can be associated with prolonged distress and heightened\narousal. For young children, reenactment of events related to trauma may appear in play\nor in dissociative states. Intense psychological distress (Criterion B4) or physiological re-\nactivity (Criterion B5) often occurs when the individual is exposed to triggering events that\nresemble or symbolize an aspect of the traumatic event (e.g., windy days after a hurricane;\nseeing someone who resembles one’s perpetrator). The triggering cue could be a physical\nsensation (e.g., dizziness for survivors of head trauma; rapid heartbeat for a previously\ntraumatized child), particularly for individuals with highly somatic presentations.\nStimuli associated with the trauma are persistently (e.g., always or almost always)\navoided. The individual commonly makes deliberate efforts to avoid thoughts, memories,\nfeelings, or talking about the traumatic event (e.g., utilizing distraction techniques to avoid\ninternal reminders) (Criterion C1) and to avoid activities, objects, situations, or people\nwho arouse recollections of it (Criterion C2).\nNegative alterations in cognitions or mood associated with the event begin or worsen\nafter exposure to the event. These negative alterations can take various forms, including an\ninability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event; such amnesia is typically\ndue to dissociative amnesia and is not due to head injury, alcohol, or drugs (Criterion D1).\nAnother form is persistent (i.e., always or almost always) and exaggerated negative ex-\npectations regarding important aspects of life applied to oneself, others, or the future (e.g.,\n“I have always had bad judgment”; “People in authority can’t be trusted”) that may man-\nifest as a negative change in perceived identity since the trauma (e.g., “I can’t trust anyone\never again”; Criterion D2). Individuals with PTSD may have persistent erroneous cogni-\ntions about the causes of the traumatic event that lead them to blame themselves or others\n(e.g., “It’s all my fault that my uncle abused me”) (Criterion D3). A persistent negative\nmood state (e.g., fear, horror, anger, guilt, shame) either began or worsened after exposure\nto the event (Criterion D4). The individual may experience markedly diminished interest\nor participation in previously enjoyed activities (Criterion D5), feeling detached or es-\ntranged from other people (Criterion D6), or a persistent inability to feel positive emotions\n(especially happiness, joy, satisfaction, or emotions associated with intimacy, tenderness,\nand sexuality) (Criterion D7).\nIndividuals with PTSD may be quick tempered and may even engage in aggressive\nverbal and/or physical behavior with little or no provocation (e.g., yelling at people, get-\nting into fights, destroying objects) (Criterion E1). They may also engage in reckless or self-\ndestructive behavior such as dangerous driving, excessive alcohol or drug use, or self-\ninjurious or suicidal behavior (Criterion E2).  PTSD is often characterized by a heightened\nsensitivity to potential threats, including those that are related to the traumatic experience\n(e.g., following a motor vehicle accident, being especially sensitive to the threat potentially\n276\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\ncaused by cars or trucks) and those not related to the traumatic event (e.g., being fearful of\nsuffering a heart attack) (Criterion E3). Individuals with PTSD may be very reactive to un-\nexpected stimuli, displaying a heightened startle response, or jumpiness, to loud noises or\nunexpected movements (e.g., jumping markedly in response to a telephone ringing) (Cri-\nterion E4). Concentration difficulties, including difficulty remembering daily events (e.g.,\nforgetting one’s telephone number) or attending to focused tasks (e.g., following a conver-\nsation for a sustained period of time), are commonly reported (Criterion E5). Problems\nwith sleep onset and maintenance are common and may be associated with nightmares\nand safety concerns or with generalized elevated arousal that interferes with adequate sleep\n(Criterion E6). Some individuals also experience persistent dissociative symptoms of de-\ntachment from their bodies (depersonalization) or the world around them (derealization);\nthis is reflected in the “with dissociative symptoms” specifier.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each should present a timeline of symptoms that could fit two disorders, and require contrastive reasoning based on onset, progression, or duration.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Development Course]\nPTSD can occur at any age, beginning after the first year of life. Symptoms usually begin\nwithin the first 3 months after the trauma, although there may be a delay of months, or\neven years, before criteria for the diagnosis are met. There is abundant evidence for what\nDSM-IV called “delayed onset” but is now called “delayed expression,” with the recogni-\ntion that some symptoms typically appear immediately and that the delay is in meeting\nfull criteria.\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder\n277\nFrequently, an individual’s reaction to a trauma initially meets criteria for acute stress\ndisorder in the immediate aftermath of the trauma. The symptoms of PTSD and the rela-\ntive predominance of different symptoms may vary over time. Duration of the symptoms\nalso varies, with complete recovery within 3 months occurring in approximately one-half\nof adults, while some individuals remain symptomatic for longer than 12 months and\nsometimes for more than 50 years. Symptom recurrence and intensification may occur in\nresponse to reminders of the original trauma, ongoing life stressors, or newly experienced\ntraumatic events. For older individuals, declining health, worsening cognitive function-\ning, and social isolation may exacerbate PTSD symptoms.\nThe clinical expression of reexperiencing can vary across development. Young children\nmay report new onset of frightening dreams without content specific to the traumatic event.\nBefore age 6 years (see criteria for preschool subtype), young children are more likely to ex-\npress reexperiencing symptoms through play that refers directly or symbolically to the\ntrauma. They may not manifest fearful reactions at the time of the exposure or during reex-\nperiencing. Parents may report a wide range of emotional or behavioral changes in young\nchildren. Children may focus on imagined interventions in their play or storytelling. In ad-\ndition to avoidance, children may become preoccupied with reminders. Because of young\nchildren’s limitations in expressing thoughts or labeling emotions, negative alterations in\nmood or cognition tend to involve primarily mood changes. Children may experience co-\noccurring traumas (e.g., physical abuse, witnessing domestic violence) and in chronic cir-\ncumstances may not be able to identify onset of symptomatology. Avoidant behavior may\nbe associated with restricted play or exploratory behavior in young children; reduced par-\nticipation in new activities in school-age children; or reluctance to pursue developmental op-\nportunities in adolescents (e.g., dating, driving). Older children and adolescents may judge\nthemselves as cowardly. Adolescents may harbor beliefs of being changed in ways that\nmake them socially undesirable and estrange them from peers (e.g., “Now I’ll never fit in”)\nand lose aspirations for the future. Irritable or aggressive behavior in children and adoles-\ncents can interfere with peer relationships and school behavior. Reckless behavior may lead\nto accidental injury to self or others, thrill-seeking, or high-risk behaviors. Individuals who\ncontinue to experience PTSD into older adulthood may express fewer symptoms of hy-\nperarousal, avoidance, and negative cognitions and mood compared with younger adults\nwith PTSD, although adults exposed to traumatic events during later life may display more\navoidance, hyperarousal, sleep problems, and crying spells than do younger adults exposed\nto the same traumatic events. In older individuals, the disorder is associated with negative\nhealth perceptions, primary care utilization, and suicidal ideation.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each case should describe overlapping symptoms and require choosing between two similar disorders, with a contrastive justification.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Differential Diagnosis]\nAdjustment disorders.\nIn adjustment disorders, the stressor can be of any severity or\ntype rather than that required by PTSD Criterion A. The diagnosis of an adjustment dis-\norder is used when the response to a stressor that meets PTSD Criterion A does not meet\nall other PTSD criteria (or criteria for another mental disorder). An adjustment disorder is\nalso diagnosed when the symptom pattern of PTSD occurs in response to a stressor that\ndoes not meet PTSD Criterion A (e.g., spouse leaving, being fired).\nOther posttraumatic disorders and conditions.\nNot all psychopathology that occurs in\nindividuals exposed to an extreme stressor should necessarily be attributed to PTSD. The\ndiagnosis requires that trauma exposure precede the onset or exacerbation of pertinent\nsymptoms. Moreover, if the symptom response pattern to the extreme stressor meets cri-\nteria for another mental disorder, these diagnoses should be given instead of, or in addi-\ntion to, PTSD. Other diagnoses and conditions are excluded if they are better explained by\nPTSD (e.g., symptoms of panic disorder that occur only after exposure to traumatic re-\nminders). If severe, symptom response patterns to the extreme stressor may warrant a sep-\narate diagnosis (e.g., dissociative amnesia).\nAcute stress disorder.\nAcute stress disorder is distinguished from PTSD because the\nsymptom pattern in acute stress disorder is restricted to a duration of 3 days to 1 month\nfollowing exposure to the traumatic event.\nAnxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nIn OCD, there are recurrent\nintrusive thoughts, but these meet the definition of an obsession. In addition, the intrusive\nthoughts are not related to an experienced traumatic event, compulsions are usually pres-\nent, and other symptoms of PTSD or acute stress disorder are typically absent. Neither the\narousal and dissociative symptoms of panic disorder nor the avoidance, irritability, and\nanxiety of generalized anxiety disorder are associated with a specific traumatic event. The\nsymptoms of separation anxiety disorder are clearly related to separation from home or\nfamily, rather than to a traumatic event.\nMajor depressive disorder.\nMajor depression may or may not be preceded by a trau-\nmatic event and should be diagnosed if other PTSD symptoms are absent. Specifically, ma-\njor depressive disorder does not include any PTSD Criterion B or C symptoms. Nor does it\ninclude a number of symptoms from PTSD Criterion D or E.\nPersonality disorders.\nInterpersonal difficulties that had their onset, or were greatly ex-\nacerbated, after exposure to a traumatic event may be an indication of PTSD, rather than a\npersonality disorder, in which such difficulties would be expected independently of any\ntraumatic exposure.\nDissociative disorders.\nDissociative amnesia, dissociative identity disorder, and de-\npersonalization-derealization disorder may or may not be preceded by exposure to a trau-\nmatic event or may or may not have co-occurring PTSD symptoms. When full PTSD criteria\nare also met, however, the PTSD “with dissociative symptoms” subtype should be considered.\nConversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).\nNew onset of somatic\nsymptoms within the context of posttraumatic distress might be an indication of PTSD\nrather than conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).\nPsychotic disorders.\nFlashbacks in PTSD must be distinguished from illusions, halluci-\nnations, and other perceptual disturbances that may occur in schizophrenia, brief psy-\nchotic disorder, and other psychotic disorders; depressive and bipolar disorders with\n280\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\npsychotic features; delirium; substance/medication-induced disorders; and psychotic dis-\norders due to another medical condition.\nTraumatic brain injury.\nWhen a brain injury occurs in the context of a traumatic event (e.g.,\ntraumatic accident, bomb blast, acceleration/deceleration trauma), symptoms of PTSD may\nappear. An event causing head trauma may also constitute a psychological traumatic event,\nand tramautic brain injury (TBI)–related neurocognitive symptoms are not mutually exclusive\nand may occur concurrently. Symptoms previously termed postconcussive (e.g., headaches,\ndizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, irritability, concentration deficits) can occur in brain-\ninjured and non-brain-injured populations, including individuals with PTSD. Because symp-\ntoms of PTSD and TBI-related neurocognitive symptoms can overlap, a differential diagnosis\nbetween PTSD and neurocognitive disorder symptoms attributable to TBI may be possible\nbased on the presence of symptoms that are distinctive to each presentation. Whereas reexpe-\nriencing and avoidance are characteristic of PTSD and not the effects of TBI, persistent disori-\nentation and confusion are more specific to TBI (neurocognitive effects) than to PTSD.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each must present overlapping symptoms, two possible diagnoses, and justify why one is preferred.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Diagnostic Features]\nThe essential feature of acute stress disorder is the development of characteristic symp-\ntoms lasting from 3 days to 1 month following exposure to one or more traumatic events.\nTraumatic events that are experienced directly include, but are not limited to, exposure\nto war as a combatant or civilian, threatened or actual violent personal assault (e.g., sexual\n282\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\nviolence, physical attack, active combat, mugging, childhood physical and/or sexual vio-\nlence, being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attack, torture), natural or human-\nmade disasters (e.g., earthquake, hurricane, airplane crash), and severe accident (e.g.,\nsevere motor vehicle, industrial accident). For children, sexually traumatic events may\ninclude inappropriate sexual experiences without violence or injury. A life-threatening\nillness or debilitating medical condition is not necessarily considered a traumatic event.\nMedical incidents that qualify as traumatic events involve sudden, catastrophic events (e.g.,\nwaking during surgery, anaphylactic shock). Stressful events that do not possess the severe\nand traumatic components of events encompassed by Criterion A may lead to an adjust-\nment disorder but not to acute stress disorder.\nThe clinical presentation of acute stress disorder may vary by individual but typically\ninvolves an anxiety response that includes some form of reexperiencing of or reactivity to\nthe traumatic event. In some individuals, a dissociative or detached presentation can pre-\ndominate, although these individuals typically will also display strong emotional or phys-\niological reactivity in response to trauma reminders. In other individuals, there can be a\nstrong anger response in which reactivity is characterized by irritable or possibly aggres-\nsive responses. The full symptom picture must be present for at least 3 days after the trau-\nmatic event and can be diagnosed only up to 1 month after the event. Symptoms that occur\nimmediately after the event but resolve in less than 3 days would not meet criteria for\nacute stress disorder.\nWitnessed events include, but are not limited to, observing threatened or serious in-\njury, unnatural death, physical or sexual violence inflicted on another individual as a re-\nsult of violent assault, severe domestic violence, severe accident, war, and disaster; it may\nalso include witnessing a medical catastrophe (e.g., a life-threatening hemorrhage) involv-\ning one’s child. Events experienced indirectly through learning about the event are limited\nto close relatives or close friends. Such events must have been violent or accidental—death\ndue to natural causes does not qualify—and include violent personal assault, suicide, se-\nrious accident, or serious injury. The disorder may be especially severe when the stressor\nis interpersonal and intentional (e.g., torture, rape). The likelihood of developing this dis-\norder may increase as the intensity of and physical proximity to the stressor increase.\nThe traumatic event can be reexperienced in various ways. Commonly, the individual\nhas recurrent and intrusive recollections of the event (Criterion B1). The recollections are\nspontaneous or triggered recurrent memories of the event that usually occur in response\nto a stimulus that is reminiscent of the traumatic experience (e.g., the sound of a backfiring\ncar triggering memories of gunshots). These intrusive memories often include sensory\n(e.g., sensing the intense heat that was perceived in a house fire), emotional (e.g., experi-\nencing the fear of believing that one was about to be stabbed), or physiological (e.g., expe-\nriencing the shortness of breath that one suffered during a near-drowning) components.\nDistressing dreams may contain themes that are representative of or thematically re-\nlated to the major threats involved in the traumatic event. (For example, in the case of a\nmotor vehicle accident survivor, the distressing dreams may involve crashing cars gener-\nally; in the case of a combat soldier, the distressing dreams may involve being harmed in\nways other than combat.)\nDissociative states may last from a few seconds to several hours, or even days, during\nwhich components of the event are relived and the individual behaves as though experi-\nencing the event at that moment. While dissociative responses are common during a trau-\nmatic event, only dissociative responses that persist beyond 3 days after trauma exposure\nare considered for the diagnosis of acute stress disorder. For young children, reenactment\nof events related to trauma may appear in play and may include dissociative moments\n(e.g., a child who survives a motor vehicle accident may repeatedly crash toy cars during\nplay in a focused and distressing manner). These episodes, often referred to as flashbacks,\nare typically brief but involve a sense that the traumatic event is occurring in the present\nrather than being remembered in the past and are associated with significant distress.\nAcute Stress Disorder\n283\nSome individuals with the disorder do not have intrusive memories of the event itself,\nbut instead experience intense psychological distress or physiological reactivity when\nthey are exposed to triggering events that resemble or symbolize an aspect of the traumatic\nevent (e.g., windy days for children after a hurricane, entering an elevator for a male or fe-\nmale who was raped in an elevator, seeing someone who resembles one’s perpetrator).\nThe triggering cue could be a physical sensation (e.g., a sense of heat for a burn victim, diz-\nziness for survivors of head trauma), particularly for individuals with highly somatic pre-\nsentations. The individual may have a persistent inability to feel positive emotions (e.g.,\nhappiness, joy, satisfaction, or emotions associated with intimacy, tenderness, or sexual-\nity) but can experience negative emotions such as fear, sadness, anger, guilt, or shame.\nAlterations in awareness can include depersonalization, a detached sense of oneself (e.g.,\nseeing oneself from the other side of the room), or derealization, having a distorted view of\none’s surroundings (e.g., perceiving that things are moving in slow motion, seeing things\nin a daze, not being aware of events that one would normally encode). Some individuals\nalso report an inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event that was\npresumably encoded. This symptom is attributable to dissociative amnesia and is not at-\ntributable to head injury, alcohol, or drugs.\nStimuli associated with the trauma are persistently avoided. The individual may refuse\nto discuss the traumatic experience or may engage in avoidance strategies to minimize\nawareness of emotional reactions (e.g., excessive alcohol use when reminded of the ex-\nperience). This behavioral avoidance may include avoiding watching news coverage of\nthe traumatic experience, refusing to return to a workplace where the trauma occurred, or\navoiding interacting with others who shared the same traumatic experience.\nIt is very common for individuals with acute stress disorder to experience problems\nwith sleep onset and maintenance, which may be associated with nightmares or with gen-\neralized elevated arousal that prevents adequate sleep. Individuals with acute stress dis-\norder may be quick tempered and may even engage in aggressive verbal and/or physical\nbehavior with little provocation. Acute stress disorder is often characterized by a height-\nened sensitivity to potential threats, including those that are related to the traumatic ex-\nperience (e.g., a motor vehicle accident victim may be especially sensitive to the threat\npotentially caused by any cars or trucks) or those not related to the traumatic event (e.g.,\nfear of having a heart attack). Concentration difficulties, including difficulty remembering\ndaily events (e.g., forgetting one’s telephone number) or attending to focused tasks (e.g.,\nfollowing a conversation for a sustained period of time), are commonly reported. Individ-\nuals with acute stress disorder may be very reactive to unexpected stimuli, displaying a\nheightened startle response or jumpiness to loud noises or unexpected movements (e.g.,\nthe individual may jump markedly in the response to a telephone ringing).\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each should present a timeline of symptoms that could fit two disorders, and require contrastive reasoning based on onset, progression, or duration.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Development Course]\nAcute stress disorder cannot be diagnosed until 3 days after a traumatic event. Although\nacute stress disorder may progress to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after 1 month,\nit may also be a transient stress response that remits within 1 month of trauma exposure\nand does not result in PTSD. Approximately half of individuals who eventually develop\nPTSD initially present with acute stress disorder. Symptom worsening during the initial\nmonth can occur, often as a result of ongoing life stressors or further traumatic events.\nThe forms of reexperiencing can vary across development. Unlike adults or adoles-\ncents, young children may report frightening dreams without content that clearly reflects\naspects of the trauma (e.g., waking in fright in the aftermath of the trauma but being unable\nto relate the content of the dream to the traumatic event). Children age 6 years and younger\nare more likely than older children to express reexperiencing symptoms through play that\nrefers directly or symbolically to the trauma. For example, a very young child who sur-\nvived a fire may draw pictures of flames. Young children also do not necessarily manifest\nfearful reactions at the time of the exposure or even during reexperiencing. Parents typi-\ncally report a range of emotional expressions, such as anger, shame, or withdrawal, and\neven excessively bright positive affect, in young children who are traumatized. Although\nchildren may avoid reminders of the trauma, they sometimes become preoccupied with\nreminders (e.g., a young child bitten by a dog may talk about dogs constantly yet avoid go-\ning outside because of fear of coming into contact with a dog).\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

{"uuid": "c14da9b8-ffdd-427e-a950-c8c6103efdff", "disorder": "Acute Stress Disorder", "section": "differential_diagnosis", "task": "3C", "qa_count": 2, "prompt": "From the Differential Diagnosis section, write 2 diagnostic comparison cases. Each case should describe overlapping symptoms and require choosing between two similar disorders, with a contrastive justification.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Differential Diagnosis]\nAdjustment disorders.\nIn acute stress disorder, the stressor can be of any severity rather\nthan of the severity and type required by Criterion A of acute stress disorder. The diagnosis of\nan adjustment disorder is used when the response to a Criterion A event does not meet the cri-\nteria for acute stress disorder (or another specific mental disorder) and when the symptom pat-\ntern of acute stress disorder occurs in response to a stressor that does not meet Criterion A for\nexposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence (e.g., spouse leaving,\nbeing fired). For example, severe stress reactions to life-threatening illnesses that may include\nsome acute stress disorder symptoms may be more appropriately described as an adjustment\ndisorder. Some forms of acute stress response do not include acute stress disorder symptoms\nand may be characterized by anger, depression, or guilt. These responses are more appro-\npriately described as primarily an adjustment disorder. Depressive or anger responses in an\nadjustment disorder may involve rumination about the traumatic event, as opposed to invol-\nuntary and intrusive distressing memories in acute stress disorder.\nPanic disorder.\nSpontaneous panic attacks are very common in acute stress disorder.\nHowever, panic disorder is diagnosed only if panic attacks are unexpected and there is\nanxiety about future attacks or maladaptive changes in behavior associated with fear of\ndire consequences of the attacks.\n286\nTrauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\nDissociative disorders.\nSevere dissociative responses (in the absence of characteristic\nacute stress disorder symptoms) may be diagnosed as derealization/depersonalization\ndisorder. If severe amnesia of the trauma persists in the absence of characteristic acute\nstress disorder symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative amnesia may be indicated.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder.\nAcute stress disorder is distinguished from PTSD because\nthe symptom pattern in acute stress disorder must occur within 1 month of the traumatic event\nand resolve within that 1-month period. If the symptoms persist for more than 1 month and\nmeet criteria for PTSD, the diagnosis is changed from acute stress disorder to PTSD.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder.\nIn obsessive-compulsive disorder, there are recurrent\nintrusive thoughts, but these meet the definition of an obsession. In addition, the intrusive\nthoughts are not related to an experienced traumatic event, compulsions are usually pres-\nent, and other symptoms of acute stress disorder are typically absent.\nPsychotic disorders.\nFlashbacks in acute stress disorder must be distinguished from il-\nlusions, hallucinations, and other perceptual disturbances that may occur in schizophre-\nnia, other psychotic disorders, depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, a\ndelirium, substance/medication-induced disorders, and psychotic disorders due to an-\nother medical condition. Acute stress disorder flashbacks are distinguished from these\nother perceptual disturbances by being directly related to the traumatic experience and by\noccurring in the absence of other psychotic or substance-induced features.\nTraumatic brain injury.\nWhen a brain injury occurs in the context of a traumatic event\n(e.g., traumatic accident, bomb blast, acceleration/deceleration trauma), symptoms of\nacute stress disorder may appear. An event causing head trauma may also constitute a\npsychological traumatic event, and tramautic brain injury (TBI)–related neurocognitive\nsymptoms are not mutually exclusive and may occur concurrently. Symptoms previously\ntermed postconcussive (e.g., headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, irritability,\nconcentration deficits) can occur in brain-injured and non–brain injured populations, in-\ncluding individuals with acute stress disorder. Because symptoms of acute stress disorder\nand TBI-related neurocognitive symptoms can overlap, a differential diagnosis between\nacute stress disorder and neurocognitive disorder symptoms attributable to TBI may be\npossible based on the presence of symptoms that are distinctive to each presenta-\ntion. Whereas reexperiencing and avoidance are characteristic of acute stress disorder and\nnot the effects of TBI, persistent disorientation and confusion are more specific to TBI (neu-\nrocognitive effects) than to acute stress disorder. Furthermore, differential is aided by the\nfact that symptoms of acute stress disorder persist for up to only 1 month following trauma\nexposure.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Each case should describe overlapping symptoms and require choosing between two similar disorders, with a contrastive justification.\n\n[BEGIN SECTION: Differential Diagnosis]\nMajor depressive disorder.\nIf an individual has symptoms that meet criteria for a major\ndepressive disorder in response to a stressor, the diagnosis of an adjustment disorder is\nnot applicable. The symptom profile of major depressive disorder differentiates it from ad-\njustment disorders.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder.\nIn adjustment disorders, the\nstressor can be of any severity rather than of the severity and type required by Criterion A\nof acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In distinguishing ad-\njustment disorders from these two posttraumatic diagnoses, there are both timing and\nsymptom profile considerations. Adjustment disorders can be diagnosed immediately\nand persist up to 6 months after exposure to the traumatic event, whereas acute stress dis-\norder can only occur between 3 days and 1 month of exposure to the stressor, and PTSD\ncannot be diagnosed until at least 1 month has passed since the occurrence of the traumatic\nstressor. The required symptom profile for PTSD and acute stress disorder differentiates\nthem from the adjustment disorders. With regard to symptom profiles, an adjustment dis-\norder may be diagnosed following a traumatic event when an individual exhibits symptoms\nof either acute stress disorder or PTSD that do not meet or exceed the diagnostic threshold\nfor either disorder. An adjustment disorder should also be diagnosed for individuals who\nhave not been exposed to a traumatic event but who otherwise exhibit the full symptom pro-\nfile of either acute stress disorder or PTSD.\nPersonality disorders.\nWith regard to personality disorders, some personality features\nmay be associated with a vulnerability to situational distress that may resemble an adjust-\nment disorder. The lifetime history of personality functioning will help inform the in-\nterpretation of distressed behaviors to aid in distinguishing a long-standing personality\ndisorder from an adjustment disorder. In addition to some personality disorders incurring\nvulnerability to distress, stressors may also exacerbate personality disorder symptoms. In\nthe presence of a personality disorder, if the symptom criteria for an adjustment disorder\nare met, and the stress-related disturbance exceeds what may be attributable to maladap-\ntive personality disorder symptoms (i.e., Criterion C is met), then the diagnosis of an ad-\njustment disorder should be made.\nOther Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder\n289\nPsychological factors affecting other medical conditions.\nIn psychological factors af-\nfecting other medical conditions, specific psychological entities (e.g., psychological symp-\ntoms, behaviors, other factors) exacerbate a medical condition. These psychological\nfactors can precipitate, exacerbate, or put an individual at risk for medical illness, or they\ncan worsen an existing condition. In contrast, an adjustment disorder is a reaction to the\nstressor (e.g., having a medical illness).\nNormative stress reactions.\nWhen bad things happen, most people get upset. This is\nnot an adjustment disorder. The diagnosis should only be made when the magnitude of\nthe distress (e.g., alterations in mood, anxiety, or conduct) exceeds what would normally\nbe expected (which may vary in different cultures) or when the adverse event precipitates\nfunctional impairment.\n[END SECTION]\n\nConstraints:\n- Use **only** the section above (and any provided supporting features) as the source of truth.

Avoid clauses, semicolons, and overly academic phrasing.\n- Aim for **Flesch Reading Ease 50–70** (high school to college level).\n- Present exactly two candidate diagnoses: \"choice_a\" and \"choice_b\".\n- Both choices must be **plausible DSM disorders** for the vignette.\n- Ensure the vignette includes overlapping features that could apply to both disorders.\n- Mark the correct choice with \"answer\": \"A\" or \"B\", and provide \"correct_diagnosis\" that exactly matches the chosen disorder.\n- Provide explanations:\n  - \"why_preferred\": Why the correct disorder is a better fit (≤60 words).\n  - \"why_not_other\": Why the alternative disorder is less fitting (≤60 words).\n- The \"supporting_features\" field must list exactly 2 short spans (≤5 words each) copied **verbatim** from the vignette text. Do not paraphrase or merge features.\n- \"evidence_spans\": Always set to [[0, 0]]. Offsets will be automatically computed in post-processing.\n- \"hallucination_flag\" must be one of: \"none\", \"minor\", \"major\".\n- \"source_section\" must always be lowercase with underscores (e.g., \"diagnostic_criteria\").\n- \"disorder_context\" must be the main disorder being processed.\n- Avoid PHI, graphic content, or stigmatizing language.\n- If the section lacks sufficient contrastive material, return fewer cases and include a \"reason\" field.\n\nDifficulty definitions:\n- EASY: Vignette strongly favors one disorder; the alternative is clearly less fitting.\n- MODERATE: Vignette has overlapping features; requires weighing 1–2 subtle cues to decide.\n- HARD: Both disorders appear highly plausible; distinction depends on fine details (e.g., onset, duration, context).\n\nDifficulty assignment:\n- If 2 items are requested, produce one \"moderate\" and one \"hard\".\n- If 3 items are requested, produce one \"easy\", one \"moderate\", and one \"hard\".\n- Do not assign the same difficulty twice in a single response.\n\n\n\nOutput format (array of objects):\n[\n  {\n    \"symptoms\": \"Short clinical vignette with overlapping features\",\n    \"choice_a\": \"Disorder A\",\n    \"choice_b\": \"Disorder B\",\n    \"answer\": \"A\" or \"B\",\n    \"correct_diagnosis\": \"Name of the chosen disorder\",\n    \"difficulty\": \"easy\" | \"moderate\" | \"hard\",\n    \"why_preferred\": \"Why the chosen disorder fits best (≤60 words)\",\n    \"why_not_other\": \"Why the other disorder is a poorer fit (≤60 words)\",\n    \"supporting_features\": [\"feature1\", \"feature2\"],\n    \"evidence_spans\": [[123, 320]],\n    \"hallucination_flag\": \"none\" | \"minor\" | \"major\",\n    \"source_section\": \"comorbidity\",\n    \"disorder_context\": \"Name of the main disorder\"\n  },\n  ...\n]\n", "response": {"contrastive_dx_items": [{"symptoms": "Patient reports marked low mood and tearfulness after sudden job loss two weeks ago.
